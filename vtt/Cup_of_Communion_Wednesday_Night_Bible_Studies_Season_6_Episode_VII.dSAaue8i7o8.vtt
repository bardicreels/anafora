I possibly can the purple

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:48.159
dye is just one of a compound one of one ingredient of a

00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:53.480
compound of of ingredients and that this is

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:59.919
used to produce another drug through

00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:06.279
her her pora her

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:12.320

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:18.080
purple but it also contains her

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:24.320
life it contains her seeds of

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:33.440
fire if you want to turn on the mystery in order to see the

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:40.000
future you're going to have to bring her drug

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:48.760
back it is all part of the bakic way this is why Jesus is arrested in a

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:59.000
public park with a naked boy at 400 a.m. because he is also trying to bring back

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.399
the communion there is the eating of Flesh

00:29:04.399 --> 00:29:10.200
and the drinking of blood and by the power of

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:16.240
Lucifer by the power of B

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:24.679
zebul the god of great counsil by his power he who sits on the

pull out here I want you guys to see this though thank you hanging in there with me I know there's I know there's

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:36.679

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:46.079
naked kid that was with Jesus when he was arrested it says that his gnos his naked parts were Petty bi Minal

00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:53.800
they were covered they were covered with that

00:34:53.800 --> 00:35:01.000
bandage what are her coverings her coverings are what

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.720
poorun poorun you know aphrodites

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:13.839
girdle that thing that has the Barb on it that she can hit somebody with what's

00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:20.880
it do when they get Barbed with it make some nuts make some

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:28.400
nuts yeah in a very specific nutty kind of way in a Sader kind kind of way in

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:35.480
the way that you would see one of these centaurs with

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:42.760
their Apostles you didn't know that centaurs had Apostles did you no you didn't but

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:48.359
you don't read Isaiah you think you do because King James has played a dirty

00:35:48.359 --> 00:35:54.079
trick on you and used the mastic text right but you don't read that text

00:35:54.079 --> 00:36:01.400
because they took all the centaurs out of the prophets it was too much

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:07.560
linguistically it was too much to consider if you look up Centaur now in ancient Greek you know what you're gonna

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:13.800
find next to it past

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:22.640
P interesting interesting Jesus Christ is

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:28.720
following as models for his salvation

00:36:29.119 --> 00:36:34.400
pasts Jesus Christ is in a

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:43.880
line of mystery petas his boys are his

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:50.720
boys ma Tha students you remember Socrates he's

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:58.680
charged for corrupting the youth yeah at least that's what is being thrown around

00:36:58.839 --> 00:37:06.960
he's not walking around with 40-year-old men right okay right he is working with

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:14.640
the young I mean he does know 40y old men but his students are of a different

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:20.520
group just like Jesus is going to be referring to his

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:25.599
kitties and sheepkin as his
