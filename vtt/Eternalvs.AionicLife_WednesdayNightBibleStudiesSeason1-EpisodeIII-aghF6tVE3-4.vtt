that I can change your life I can make you a new person

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.660

[Music]

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.880
and with such power Billy Graham brought you

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.000
eternal life eternal life can we see can we see John

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.840
3 16 please can we see John 3 16. everybody together is their opening

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:14.539
reading tonight in this Bible study let's look at John 3 16.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.020
edoken

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.419
is

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:48.660
ion what is eternal life God so loved the world

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.000
that he gave his only son his only born son

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.860
the monogenes who had been prophesied of he gave them

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:08.940
for the sake of what for the sake of ionic life translated to

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.039
you as Eternal and tonight what I want to show you

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:20.100
is the world where eternal life doesn't exist

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:28.740
it's nowhere in the Bible it is not a promise of eternal life it

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:37.020
is a promise promise of ionic life what is this thing

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.259
let's see let's see a a an excellent false derivation of that

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:49.020
um more eternal life bring us bring it on you ghosts of the Dead bring on more

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.560
eternal life

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:02.460
is there for life and they shall never perish neither sell

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.340
any man collect them out of my hand the Bible says verily verily I say Unity he that heareth my word and believeth on

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.500
him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.539
is passed from Death unto life Jesus said and whosoever liveth and believeth

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:24.180
in me shall never die believe us thou this and if you believe on Christ you'll

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.000
never die some people think eternal life means life that goes on and on and on and on

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.720
and on and on and on and on and on and on and on so the life they have now

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:42.419
they think oh that just continues and doesn't stop

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:48.060
no eternal life is the renderings the English rendering

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.120
house [Music] so wait

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.560
eternal life is used in the English language to

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.960
describe the life that that only belongs to the

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.240
eternal the truth is the way of eternal life we need to be able to follow it eternal

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.300
life eternal life external life eternal life eternal life

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.979

misconceptions and lies that you have been fed by people who's pretend to know

Greek and tell you oh it's from the Greek and it means this and they do not know it can I get a hail

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:12.500
Satan

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:23.160
let's see it let's see them in their Foolery let's go please show us the

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.920
Chewie show us the the false derivation the third clip that we've got yeah if

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:37.320
you know very much about the story of the Bible you've probably heard that Jesus offers eternal life sounds nice what does Jesus

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.779
mean by eternal life well Jesus adopted this phrase from the Hebrew scriptures

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:47.820
in English it's translated eternal life or sometimes everlasting life but the

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:53.880
phrase literally translated from Hebrew is life unto the age

00:11:53.880 --> 00:12:01.079
yeah yeah seriously did he just say that it's

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:07.019
adopted from the Hebrew and you people just sit there and uh-huh uh-huh it's

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:12.240
adopted from the Hebrew I just showed you the Mycenaean

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:19.260
the proto-hebrew is it earliest 9th century BC

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:28.140
this is not Hebrew this is not Semitic this is Greek in its oldest form at

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:34.380
least the oldest recovery formula we have so far right linearity is going to go back but let them let them work on

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:43.320
their end so the proto-hebrew is to say that this is derived from Hebrew is is tantamount

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:49.560
to taking you in a back alley and having way with you

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:55.620
yes very bad shame on these people shame on these people and why do people

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:03.079
believe this because we have to if it logically works out within the

00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:08.700
judeo-christian mystery the the languages have to follow each

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.860
other and that original Source has to be Hebrew they can't live their Universe

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.959
shatters without that the masoretic sects in the 10th Century starts crying

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:24.420
out from their graves oh we created you attacks

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:32.180
and that tradition has bound you for a thousand years

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:38.639
yes yes it's time to wake up what is the ion where do we always go here at least

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:45.779
Babylon we go to the medwa right we go to the Aryans who call themselves The

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:51.899

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:57.620
interesting except lady Babylon seriously

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.820
love it love it okay tonight I'd like to bring you a text

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:08.040
where we can see the ion and to show you that it

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:14.279
um has been poorly poorly terribly mistranslated and criminally perhaps as

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:21.899
eternal yes eternal seriously guys okay let me pull up the

00:14:21.899 --> 00:14:32.579
Medea text this is the fourth pythian ode and it is a record of Medea's Oracle

00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:39.660
of Medea's Oracle beautiful thank you very much Julie so what is take it down for a second

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:45.000
what is Medea's Oracle media's Oracle as well it's one of the Oracles of Medea

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.600
that she had a down from Sarah Santorini oh

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:56.279
and uh this was before the explosion

00:14:56.279 --> 00:15:04.260
yeah anyway um she handed down this uh Oracle of the future that was kept by

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:09.899
the pythia that's awesome was kept by the pythia and the pithia

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:16.740
pythia went ahead and uh released it when the inquiry was there that was

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:21.899
relevant to the oracle um it was about the founders of cyrini

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:27.959
and some yeah stuff in Northern Africa good stuff anyway

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:35.220

this ionic life is a part of the mystery

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:54.179
the initiate who enters death and is brought back to

00:27:54.179 --> 00:27:58.158

the state the the initiate answers

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:28.919

00:28:28.919 --> 00:28:33.960
the church pushing it I woman what I want means and whether it means

finance was the was the by General one nobody ever believes me in that but

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:34.100
um look um here is Jesus right we're talking about Jesus and it says in that very time for that first line

00:30:35.179 --> 00:30:42.480
he's got the Zone he's got the bra and it's around his mastoise

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:48.059

00:30:48.059 --> 00:30:55.440
breasts it's around his breasts and this zone is a very important thing it um it's a

00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:02.880
ceremonial thing worn by priestesses who are collecting the

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:11.399
little Cirrus exudate from their breasts for the sake of ritual use

00:31:11.399 --> 00:31:19.260
yeah Jesus is wearing one in the apocalypse Jesus is wearing one can you believe that okay and is uh anyway verse

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:27.120
14 and his head right he's got white hairs on his head there white like a lamb and yeah he on like the snow and

eruption of fire the flocks oh it's got so much

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:46.740
meaning he's the one that you can't see but appears oh this is fantastic and his

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:53.159
feet are like bronze why does he have the bronze feet because she has the bronze feet

00:31:53.159 --> 00:32:00.899
um if I show you the vampire text that I have if I show you the vampire text from

00:32:00.899 --> 00:32:06.120
Mike morulis who's the Buddy of Vlad

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:13.559
um the Impaler uh in his perfect perfect cult Latin by the way which in 1450 or

00:32:13.559 --> 00:32:20.159
whenever whenever he wrote this maybe a little before them but for the time that was the most

00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:29.399
outstanding Latin and to way too close to the cult um to not be right in the big darn

00:32:29.399 --> 00:32:36.779
middle of it um but he will tell you and it's him to I turn it to us he he brings you the ion

00:32:36.779 --> 00:32:42.240
yeah why because he's the the guy who knows the purple

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:49.440
right and the use of the Pearl remember their wings the purple right before the in the Oracle of Medea you guys have to

that's sometimes rendered as two eggs or double edged

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:26.880
but it literally says cutting two ways

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:33.179
anyway and uh yeah so he's got a stars and his face is opsis his expression is

oh yeah you begin to see it can you taste it yeah

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:52.020
um so yeah he was dead and alive he came back right and um put his right hand on

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:58.160
him saying don't be afraid now look at how Jesus identifies himself here at verse uh

18. uh 17.5 Eagle Amy I am

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:13.619
the first in the boom accomplishment finish the finishing

00:35:13.619 --> 00:35:21.420
love it eschatology kind of Zone and the living

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:42.500
necross and behold I am alive ace deuce eye on us

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:51.859
um how do you translate that it's in the plural it it says into the ions of ions

00:35:51.859 --> 00:35:58.619
there has never yet been written a good English translation of that expression

00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:05.640
and if I were to walk into your pastor's office if I kick down this door and walked in and threw my great text in

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:12.480
front and said listen you little braggart tell me what does this expression mean

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:19.800
he wouldn't be able to he wouldn't be able to no no

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:26.280
yeah why because they don't read they just pretend to right anybody who tells you they do

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:31.640
Greek yeah okay foreign

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:38.880
it's Rich it's deep it's deep right you say it with reverence you know

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:47.280
and fear a classical philologist says that with reverence and fear because they've seen the great wonderful depths

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:53.820
of Greek and they've swamped they know they know and respect its beauty and

00:36:53.820 --> 00:37:01.140
anybody who tells you they know it probably doesn't they just have had a couple of semesters I left Dallas

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:07.740
Theological Seminary I went to the president and I was like look I just started my THM program and I have a

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:13.260
bachelor's in Classics with a double major in Greek and Latin so

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:18.480
um your program is weak and he was like yeah bro he didn't say

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:25.260
bra or he may have said brother but he's he was like yeah bro it is he

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:31.200
confessed it was weak it wasn't what it used to be I had looked at some Scholars who come there when they were all

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:37.260
reading Lewisberry Schaefer and so I knew and it was just weak

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:44.160
seminaries they're weak they are weak I went into a seminary and within a very

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:50.940
short period of time two years within a very short period of time I had people saying what the what are these

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:57.119
students doing their Greek is suddenly fantastic they don't even have to know that anymore you should have been teaching

00:37:57.119 --> 00:38:04.859
them Latin what's in the Pope's decrees

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:10.859
anyway um yeah look he's into the ions of ions

00:38:10.859 --> 00:38:17.220
that's that's a prepositional phrase there into the ions of ions

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:23.820
yeah what does it mean I'm engaging

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:30.619
I am that ions of ions

00:38:30.839 --> 00:38:38.880
now for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:45.079
that whosoever believeth gonna love the King James

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:51.240
on him should not perish but have

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:57.300
ion interesting

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:03.240
yeah you have just uncovered a new a new reality

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:10.200
there is no eternal life that is such an absurdity it's a

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:17.640
self-contradicting statement right um because the ion is by definition

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:22.980
especially if you're Pythagorean and you another action to 10 the decade does

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:30.300
anybody know the deck head no nobody knows the decade oh don't eat the cobbler on the way there

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:35.820
right Cobble is later it's medieval it's off

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:41.280
anyway um here we have the fruit and we're looking

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:49.619
at it here we have the ion the ion is outside it's outside of the time so a

00:39:49.619 --> 00:39:55.980
definition of Eternal for it is sad is sad and I can talk about other Greek

00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:01.260
words used for Eternal I can talk about simple adverb and it's roots and the
