00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:48.880
into the drugs I can't wait I don't mean to yeah please go ahead Matthew 2111 and

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:56.519
the crowd did what they said this guy's a prophet because people were s making a big deal who's who is this what there's

00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:01.680
a crowd freaking parade who is he he's Prophet they say he's

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.798
Jesus yeah and he's from Nazareth up in the Galilee I used to

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:12.918
wake up if you don't mind me indulging in our last season I used to wake up it

00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:20.558
about 30 minutes before Sunrise yeah um and would go out maybe

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:25.839
be collecting chickens right and watch the

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:33.400
sunrise and we sat in an area that was kind of elevated Hills and

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:39.480
Jezreel just on the Northern side of the West Bank and we would I would look out

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.640
at Nazareth off in the distance you know you got the

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:51.080
Galilee and it's quite it's quite a beautiful it's quite a beautiful place I

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:58.200
dodged Rockets they had Rockets going over us too right this stuff going down

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:06.120
right all the stuff going down there just keeps going down yeah and so uh it was part part and

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:12.320
parel but I avoided it by riding a horse through the Jezreel Valley that's what I

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:18.480
did um to me that's the place because if you haven't been there if you don't know

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.760
you don't know um yeah anyway let's get back to the text here we're back at the

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.600
part what's the thing Jesus is prohibiting look what's happened the crowd they say this guy's a prophet he's

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:38.559
Jesus he's From Galilee next one yeah and um so yeah yeah yeah what did Jesus

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:44.600
do he kicks out everybody who is selling and those who were

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.679
buying right in the temple in the temple

00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:54.799
itself and what does he do he overturns the places they got set up for people to

00:18:54.799 --> 00:19:00.960
make change right and um you've seen this you know this great

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:07.039
episode I'm sure we've got a B bunch of pictures let me finish it though and what did he do he turned over the seats

00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:13.039
of those who were selling what Tas

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:18.640
peras and we translate that as

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:24.600
Dove Dove and I want you to keep in mind give

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:32.039
me the next one please I want you to keep in mind that those doves are not always doves chewy go to the last go to

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:39.840
the last uh boom yeah thanks appreciate it Chey look at these

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:47.120
padis doves or priestesses at dodona these are oracular priestesses

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:55.280
and if you look down to that fourth line you see a little clue to the whole puzzle it's theion of

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:02.880
Ammon it's the Oracle of Ammon do you know where you find the doves you find the

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:09.919
doves at the Oracle of Amon don't you like that those of you

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:15.320
who pause it and go back and I know you do because you try to catch everything

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:21.200
um go and take a look at that and get the context of what's going on there um

plural so you mean in the singular it is that

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:35.360
container of the thing that's being used for the whatever

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:41.760
the building is doing in this case the Holy Temple where we commune with God

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:08.559
excuse me Peno those hyro companions that's how

00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:15.120
it's referring to his Apostles right his companions and we know that those can be

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:21.519
um prostitutes they can be um or they can be what you and I would call escorts

00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:26.760
something like that something in that range but notice he uses an action an

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:32.720
adjective here Peno and that really means um with

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:39.600

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:01.639
please yeah go to the next one I just want you to see a couple of fragments here because some people were quoting

00:32:01.639 --> 00:32:09.840
from the Bible it really got my goat today some people were quoting from the Bible big people on YouTube and they had

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:17.000
the gumption to talk about this gets my goat so much to talk about their knowledge of the Greek and all they had

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.880
to do all they had to do was say predicate and they lost their audience

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:30.720
then they're at a point where they can say whatever they want they can say whatever they want uncontrolled and we

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:37.159
congregation Satan are completely unprotected right unless we arm

00:32:37.159 --> 00:32:44.679
ourselves with the tools that it takes this is what Omnia will offer arming

00:32:44.679 --> 00:32:50.240
ourselves with the tools that it takes not to be lied

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:59.039
to but to cut to that purest of streams to keep that Muse sacred

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:05.960

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:11.440
want to take us to a little fragment here to wash that terrible biblical

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:17.120
scholar stuff out of my brain um they're awful people it's deceptive it's worse

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:24.399
than you think people think oh well those poor Knuckleheads they just don't have the training that's true

00:33:24.399 --> 00:33:31.039

priestesses do why do you think we we pick them the way that we

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:26.240

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:33.000
against them against those invisible Powers those authorities that's all

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.079

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:20.760
credited also with bringing the alphabet that the Hut

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:28.400
dwelling I'm sorry the Romans in all their Glory at this time we're living in

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:36.480
Huts which is not that makes me sound like it's I'm discriminating against Huts I suppose but if the Romans from

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:43.920
the first century could see the Romans then they could look at each other look at each other's buildings the old Romans

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:50.880
Hut dwellers would be quite impressed with the achievements that their ancestors were able to do by the way if

00:49:50.880 --> 00:50:02.240
anybody knows the sacred name of Rome Now's the Time to bring it up none of you know none of you no nobody let's

00:50:02.319 --> 00:50:07.720

Mithra Mithra who is

00:50:42.599 --> 00:50:47.799
Mithra now the Assyrians at this time this is written it's not referring

00:50:47.799 --> 00:50:54.079

they're people and what comes out of your mouth fire and smoke and

00:59:32.599 --> 00:59:38.240
sulfur fire and smoke and sulfur now why would you be doing this because we're in

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:45.920
a cult baby the fifth angel he goes into his he's going off baby it's a new act

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:53.440
where at the party's new and I saw a star fall from uranos to the gain to the

00:59:53.440 --> 01:00:00.000
ground and and what was given to the star was given to him the CL

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.359

01:00:05.359 --> 01:00:12.319
Abyss yeah okay people I give you the

01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:18.079
key Peter I give you the key and why are

01:00:18.079 --> 01:00:26.240
we doing this because we at Omnia are going to make death disa here it's the

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:31.400
greatest magic trick ever and how are we going to do that contrary to what you

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:36.839
might intuitively think you got to run straight into it we

01:00:36.839 --> 01:00:42.720
got to send you into death to deprive you of your fear of

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:48.079
it yeah Isn't that cool Isn't that

01:00:48.079 --> 01:00:55.319
cool oh God I love it let's go back to the text okay a little bit crazy creepy

01:00:55.319 --> 01:01:02.160
on the cryp ometer it was a little bit up there but look people and in these

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:10.039
days people will seek after death and they will not find

01:01:10.039 --> 01:01:17.400
him they won't find Death they'll really desire to

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:23.359
die and death will flee from them do you

01:01:23.359 --> 01:01:29.799
want to know when that abomination of desolation enters the temple do you want

01:01:29.799 --> 01:01:34.640
to know what will happen death will

01:01:35.599 --> 01:01:40.720
flee yeah I am the

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:47.240
way I am the life right what does that Son of God do

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:53.200
are you talking Hercules yes are you talking Jesus yes

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:59.440
they put push off death they wrestle

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:06.839
death yeah wow wow you mean all of that for a paternal God who doesn't recognize

01:02:06.839 --> 01:02:15.160
the great mother right we all know that she's above everybody else that's the difference between the orix and the

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:20.279
Christianity the orix recognize the great mother Christianity

01:02:20.279 --> 01:02:26.240
didn't right and you think well it's just the way things happened and you

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:33.240
know God there's just a man God because that's the universe we live in that was created 6,000 years ago and there's this

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:40.799
man God and there's no woman God there's no mother I mean logically there's a God the father right there's got to be a God

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:47.640
the father but there is no God the mother absolutely not well the oric said

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:55.000
absolutely and it turns out that she is the origin of everything even your man

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:03.400
God you mean a father God has a mother yeah it's basic logic people

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:10.760
what's wrong with you orphism is just physics basic logic yeah use it let's do

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:09.640
mystery cult is harnessing the power of

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:16.080
drugs the power of the pharmacos the power of the

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:21.920
Magus the power of the Son of God the power of the

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:31.080
Savior how were harnessing those things through a

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:38.199
scos those baskets those holy baskets they're full of it they're full of

01:11:38.199 --> 01:11:43.400

the I forget about it now to you but if you check check the um the gospel

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:02.679
sources you'll find that it's children it says couple of times it even has a

01:12:02.679 --> 01:12:08.760
verse we may have skipped it but it puts the children in the age in the age of

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:15.280
kids who were still being nursed that's the youngest from the Nur up to the

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:21.159
napos the the imbeciles when did they think that a child was an imbecile in

01:12:21.159 --> 01:12:27.320
Antiquity when they weren't quiet the level of mental competence that's okay

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:33.960

you know who his discreet apostles were they were the boys from Galilee they

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:26.360
were the boys from Galilee Jesus was taking over territory he was breaking

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:34.440
bed and and it ended up costing him it was an expensive maneuver and when he is

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:42.239

Jesus being arrested in a public park with a naked boy yelling I'm not a

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:16.159
trafficker yeah yeah you see what Jesus was doing he was taking over the

01:15:16.159 --> 01:15:22.679
operation right and he knew it he knew he was going to get stuck with it because the Romans they didn't deal with

01:15:22.679 --> 01:15:28.040
those people well they were armed and dangerous

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:33.840
right right put away put away the fairy tale Peter's walking around with

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:41.040
something he's ready to stab you with yeah yeah and he's also naked on a

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.159
boat with a bunch of children at night and when he sees Jesus in the morning

01:15:46.159 --> 01:15:51.679
has to put his clothes on

01:15:51.679 --> 01:15:57.120
yeah it's that can we just flash up to to finish off can we just flash up that

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:04.719
last the very first um yep please come back to this with me people and

01:16:04.719 --> 01:16:12.000
realize nonas is saying that thing that they put up for Jesus to drink from that

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:21.920
was the antidote to that Vision inducing sacred

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:28.800
communion yeah it was the antidote they may have brought him out of it they may

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:36.360
have brought him out of it yeah as is they his um he ended up not

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:42.679
getting his legs broken anyway I think that's pretty good part of the deal if they had just been able to get to him

01:16:42.679 --> 01:16:51.000
right how many people had he revived in this process right so would have been easy

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:58.639
would have been easy and you know what do you think Mary was doing right Mary Magdalene I'm talking

01:16:58.639 --> 01:17:05.000
right oh God behold your mother at least he looked at the little boy that sat on

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:11.159
his lap remember and came up to his breast John the one that he loved right

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:16.560
at least he gave that little kid to his virgin mother who strangely enough was

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:22.480
only 12 years older than Jesus so when you see Jesus on the cross and Mary you

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:29.360
