[Music]

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.199
welcome back to satanic initiation we have a great service tonight

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:10.979
praise be to Lucifer we finally have a sacrifice but before we can get to that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.840
I need to reiterate the two principles number one we follow reason in this

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.479
Temple space that we have constructed we follow reason

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.119
number two any of our efforts are thwarted

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:38.540
by profit anybody choosing to profit off of this Sacred Space

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.500
is polluted and to be outcast um yes beautiful beautiful

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.700
um let's let's proceed then with the purification shall we um I want to bring up uh um this lamb of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.600
a goodie before you and I want to sh uh present to you some of a comment that

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.180
was given and I want to look at it reasonably and discuss it just for a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.500
second and that'll be our springboard into the dragon because I know that you all have come here to be dragon

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.580
so it is my honor and privilege tonight to introduce you to the dragon I'm

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:30.060
warning you there's quite a bit of esoteric uh uh meaning and uh ritual and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.580
linguistics you can love this it's beautiful

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.019
um where is it bring the sacrifice um hit the hit the number one please

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:52.260
this is from Nick thank you Nick for the input almond I respect you for popularizing

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.980
and reviewing ancient texts but because you are not even aware about

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.519
City and culture you are butchering things it's the first time I've ever been

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.620
called a butcher but I'd rather like it anacarsis

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:18.420
wrote about sitting uh anacarsus explain the scythian history to the Greeks he's

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.200
this figure that's um kind of the George Washington of the syrians right

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.440
um yeah but late he's late Ryan's real late so you know this is six this is

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.420
well beyond when the late Bronze Age cillians were at their their Peak yes

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.920
but anyway let's keep reading um Aries for example was a lord ruler and a

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.159
god an ancient papyri a God is the ruler who has the trust of

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.940
his followers I've been reading ancient Papyrus all week and I can't say that that's the case

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:08.400
um yeah yeah um if you're talking about specific references I think you're being I think

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.860
I just felt smell just a slight Nick a slight taint

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.859
um of the trust in his followers that's somebody who hasn't really

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.040
I can tell your your feet haven't been deep into the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.660
Greek and the Greek Traditions um about the Aryans and the histories of the Aryans

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.040
oh you're gonna love it Herodotus would smile right

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.220
um yeah let's look at let's look at the origins but I'm going to take you back Nick I'm going to take you back and I'm

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.560
going to make you look into the face of that queen that Queen and so what else

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.199
do we say about Aryans yeah his people took the name Aryans

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:01.560
with an I notice that Aryans is with an eye and all of a sudden you smell what

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.580
do you smell you smell 1898. yeah and you smell some Scholars and

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:16.680
some intellectuals in Germany yes this is fun I love this stuff and uh

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.560
uh descendants I assume you meant descendants series dickheadans but descendants of them are now in places

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.919
like Iran Ireland Romania Armenia Etc and then Nick

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.139
has a request I beg you to distance yourself from the satanists

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.139
it tells you people get me in trouble and pedophilia or you guys will soon end

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:49.020
up hanged by the neck in the Public Square yes yes let's look that provides us the

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.120
the perfect springboard and Nick um

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.560
look you know between you and me um it's the sources that matter uh

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.960
you're like a detective when you do this when you look at history and you have to

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.419
piece things together and you can say that cadaver was shot but if you don't

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:20.400
find a hole and a bullet oh you've got problems

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:29.039
to the satanic congregation I want to address I want you to see what Nick is doing this is what I warned

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.979
I warned about right there will be those of you who will be seduced

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:41.220
who will be seduced by the academics I worked with academics

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.740
right I went um I went to a conference in England

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:54.419
once and at this conference just so you can know who I am I went to a conference in England and uh the London Times

00:06:54.419 --> 00:07:00.060
happened to be there they were they were doing reporting on it and they came and

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:07.319
reviewed um the work in my panel and they said of my work that it was the last Wild

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:13.639
Frontier of Classics an ostrich Professor that nobody that apparently never talks to anybody

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:20.520
happened to approach me and say you may be right to which is graduate students

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:28.380
said oh my goodness oh my goodness this is wonderful right um once you're in these texts that provides

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:35.220
you with an immunity there's two types of people there's people who know this evidence who can read it and those

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.319
people read every day they wake up in the morning they read ancient Greek

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:45.660
okay it's just the the way it is it's their occupation and then there are

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:53.220
those people there are those rules who have come in amongst the Sheep who claim

00:07:53.220 --> 00:08:00.720
a knowledge of the Greek and somebody who's been doing this for 30 years like myself has

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:08.220
developed enough skill to be able to tell right away when somebody in his field is a

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:15.080
beginner or doesn't have that breadth of knowledge that they should

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:21.599
and I'd like to bring you some of that knowledge right now some of these texts

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:27.240
we're going to look at some things that people don't ordinarily look at and we're going to look at the Aryan

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.640
connection and we're going to look at the dragon and what is the Dragon

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.959
okay so let's uh uh let's get into it

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:46.740
foreign pulling up the very next row please

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:52.339
I want to show you a couple of definitions yes

00:08:52.339 --> 00:09:00.300
excellent good um I want you to um typically so I'll come over like this typically uh so as

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.760
you can see from Nick's paragraph he spelled Aryan with an i right and I'll

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:12.660
show you in a minute how the victorians very nicely sifted out for us but that by the time of straybow

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:18.959
um there's this active debate about what's the real root right is it Alpha

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:26.339
row oopsilon or is it Alpha row iota and um Nick would be jumping around

00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:31.800
saying this is a Sanskrit route it's not it's not this is a vesting it says

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:39.779
nothing to do um here's the problem on the Greek side it this word has its own derivation and

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:46.380
I'll show you the texts that talk about that derivation and I'll show you a little cannabis in Antiquity the

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:53.220
question tonight is what is the street name of cannabis yeah in Antiquity the street name what do you call it I can't

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.560
wait to show you okay so aruo here I just want you to notice that this verb

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:04.700
in Greek is shown to us in the Oxford lexicon um it's going to be some type of drawing

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:10.440
or pulling a a movement that has to do with out of

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:17.160
something toward the drawer toward the one performing the action and you can see at the bottom there's a lovely

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.800
um little quote about uh it's used as stars rising out of the sea right so to

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:30.360
aruo is to draw that's interesting and wonderful because we have the same root that is used in

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.540
words like Hera and Aries

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:44.880
um and you'll notice right away oh we have names of gods that are creeping in yes we do you're in the right Cult Don't

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:51.660
Worry right this is where we're supposed to be um why can't we why can't we turn away

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:56.760
from the pedophilia by the way why can't we when I went to the University of

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.820
Wisconsin I discovered where the ceiling was and so I picked up a rock and I

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:10.680
shattered it and I said from now on I'm always going to break through the ceiling because the

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:17.519
establishment there was saying you cannot say that um the founders of Western Civilization

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:24.360
use drugs you can't say that and uh after seeing what I had seen

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.640
um you know hey it wasn't it wasn't hard for me to say Hey you know Marcus Aurelius and those meditations you love

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:35.399
to read Professor so and so from Ireland you know who you are Professor so-and-so

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:41.760
from Ireland um yeah um you have to realize what's uh what's

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:48.300
going on with some of the material that's around you right um and they didn't want to do this they

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:54.899
didn't want to do this so I'm going to bring that to you and it starts here with aruo let's go to the next let's go

00:11:54.899 --> 00:12:01.380
to the next what are you raising out of the sea um well we're raising Aryans

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:08.760
right okay I want to move here and I want to show you the audio and how it is that

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.519
the victorians Define them the ancient name of the medes ancient name of the medes look at that

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:23.160
it's not we get about Iranian Highlands oh that's beautiful later with respects to Persia right next

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:30.480
slide please yeah this is a section of Herodotus

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:37.040
and I want to read you a little a little bit of Herodotus starting at apico Menace

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:44.300
which is one two three four five lines down halfway through the line apical Minis

00:12:46.579 --> 00:12:52.500
ex athene is tutus

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.200
foreign

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:21.079
excuse me after Medea after Medea

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:28.860
arrived from Athens and which which Media or which medwa the kolkian medwa

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:34.260
after she arrived in Athens um the people there the Aryans changed

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:41.519
their name right to the medes to suit her and this is what they all

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:46.740
this is what they all call themselves so they changed their genos they change

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:55.519
their ethnic name yeah isn't that neat isn't that neat okay next please

00:13:56.459 --> 00:14:02.040
I just want you to notice that the victorians are noticing

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:07.920
that the root is changing from the Ari to the aru and why is it why would we

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.579
have um we can read here at the bottom modern philology gives the name Aryan of course very much water extension which was

00:14:14.579 --> 00:14:22.019
which indeed was beginning even the time of strabo so it looks like at least by the time it's drabo that this is this is

00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:27.959
a um debate a linguistic debate at the time because there are these excellent

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:33.180
things and these are the these are the authors that these people who claim knowledge and just give you

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:39.899
generalizations anytime you get a generalizations it's bunk if somebody's you know we're detectives this is

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:44.940
history and we're detectives you better bring me some evidence and you better

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:53.220
lay it out religious historians love love love love love the ideas and the theories

00:14:53.220 --> 00:15:00.720
right they're not so good with the actual evidence so what about these Aryans what about these Aryans

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.000
um right um that drawing

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.260
is the very thing that the Mad boy become known for doing that connection

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:17.760
to drawing down they had an expression to draw down the Moon

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:23.820
can anybody draw down the Moon yeah can you draw the Stars you can draw

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:30.500
a third of them if you've got the right tail you can draw a third of them

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:36.240
yeah Stars why would you want to draw Stars aren't those the things that we

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.699
look up at right they're just they're just balls I'm sending a slight old

00:15:41.699 --> 00:15:44.899
light hitting us

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:53.459
in order to get there to those Stars we got to go through a dragon

00:15:53.459 --> 00:16:01.819
a dragon who is protecting a Sacred Space what is a dragon

00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:10.220
can you please bring up for me the first dragon

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:17.040
there we go um just bring up dracon please the first dragon thank you

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:25.560
yep perfect take a look at this Through The Eyes of Alice from Alice in Wonderland yes and by the way we cannot

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:32.420
give up that pedophilia we must track down the source of this saturnian

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:40.560
satanic I can't I can't Nick I can't abandon the saturnian way I can't stop

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:47.519
people from seeing via these dead people by these sources that Judaism and

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:54.180
Christianity are inventions of saturnian or satanic Magic

00:16:54.180 --> 00:17:01.380
yeah I'm gonna show you Moses's stick here in a second go right follows the muse

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:06.900
be careful okay what is this drag and bring up the dragon right notice right

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:12.540
away on the top they tell you it's from der Kumai and that's because our ancient

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:18.480
etymologists our ancient etymologists the people who sat down and tried to figure out make lexicon figure out where

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:24.260
these words come from um and there's quite a few you can read them I'm saying this door is my favorite

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:29.460
but anyway it's only because he says almond is the Antichrist

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:36.840
I don't know why anyway so uh if if if we can look at how the where the word

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:43.020
comes from remember I tell all my students the first and I love this the first I really get into this the first

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:48.480
day I tell them everything that you're gonna be seeing in the vocabulary and

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:55.919
Greek all of these words come from somewhere they all have roots

00:17:55.919 --> 00:18:01.400
and these roots have histories they're their own

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.900
organisms tonight I want to show you the Str root

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:13.559
the s t r root I'd call it the sigma Tau row root because that's how I see it

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:18.780
most but I'm going to use the Latin right oh okay fantastic I'm so excited

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:24.500
okay let's go um back to the dragon what is that dragon

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:31.440
um are you ready what is the Dragon the dragon is a serpent

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.380

Viper love it love it um yeah did you know about dragons ah I

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:07.799
think he knew a thing or two and his seal proves it the seal on his text proves it by the way nobody's responded

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:15.900
to me yet about young seal nobody's found it I'll show it to you you will love it it's it's delicious

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:21.480
yeah okay um it can also be people look at that the dragon standard yeah and um

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:29.039
we have two sources that tell us the dragon like the wolves are Temple Guardians and we know they're individual

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:36.780
people right and we're meeting with these people there's we're talking real concrete history now I don't want funny

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:42.480
funny story land I I want the actuality I want to bring you the actuality and

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.600
that's the sacrifice that Nick has to pay he has to see the reality

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:54.600
of the Aryans with the why why is it the why is it the why why is there the

00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:00.179
debate over the Upsilon the why english-wise and oopsilon right so um

00:21:00.179 --> 00:21:09.440
why why do we have the debate over the Upsilon or the iota right oh it's amazing something's hiding

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:15.419
something's hiding in the Upsilon and it's a diagama

00:21:15.419 --> 00:21:21.539
it's a diagram it's an old old Greek letter I'm talking Mycenaean Bronze Age

00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:28.980
letter I'm talking contemporary with the very Origins of what you consider

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:35.640
um Sanskrit right and earlier that's what I'm talking

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:43.500
you think Aryan came from Sanskrit you don't want to know why they put the W in it because it's a Dye gamma

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.840
yeah Ottawa yeah isn't that nice yeah who are these

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:54.360
who are these uh people and and what's with all their cannabis we know that

00:21:54.360 --> 00:22:00.960
Herodotus spills the beans on a cannabis let's just go now to the Cannabis in the

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:08.580
ancient text now put that back up I like that I was just starting to yes let's just go to the Cannabis in the text now

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:14.820
and look at what these scythians Nick I know that you've never I don't want to

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:21.179
do this because it's painful but I know that you've never met Sita right

00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:32.039
um and she is the name given to medwa or Medea by the poet

00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:39.740
with the flattering tongue who is named dracontius

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:45.240
yes yes and if you would read you didn't know dracontius was a source for the

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:51.900
scythians did you no I know you didn't Nick when you're around the professionals

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:57.419
enough you start to you start to see where the knowledge is able to filter to

00:22:57.419 --> 00:23:02.480
I won't look look at this people that that's an entire volume

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:10.520
770 Pages 770 pages on antidotes antidotes

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:17.039
antidotes and great you see it's translation no you don't because it hasn't been translated just on the

00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:23.700
antidotes so let's blow the lid off this thing and

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:29.640
let's look at what the actual history was bring us up did you bring us up the Diane squirties I hereby summon

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:34.700
diascortis great

00:23:35.299 --> 00:23:42.780
pharmacologist we really don't have some people want to say he's a physician but he doesn't really classify as a

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:48.059
physician he doesn't look like he practices much he looks like he's more

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:55.559
on the pharmacology side he's more like the Buddy of the root Cutters that we were looking at yeah and anyway he's got

00:23:55.559 --> 00:24:01.799
a great section if you could bring that up now um yeah it is here I will show you

00:24:01.799 --> 00:24:07.380

you do so I appreciate that no not that one that's a nice one but here yes this

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.860
one this is it okay so this is Dias Gordy's who is himself you you'll have

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:37.020
to excuse me this background um diascortis is the one who is writing

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:44.880
about all the Botanicals and where you get them and what they do and what powers they have and he's also writing about the poisons and the poisons that

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:52.620
you use um to counteract those poisons wonderful stuff Venoms oh love it love it let's

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:58.820
anyway bring us back the text there of diascortis yep nope there we go and

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:05.700
cannabis there you guys see cannabis in its original Greek form hey mattos that's just the cultivated kind right

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:13.620
there's wild agria there's wild cannabis and the kind that you actually work with yeah and now he's gonna say Hoy they can

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.658
Avion Hoy Des

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:31.200
the Romans call their stuff kanabim he has street names for the drugs that are

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:40.679
used yeah and as you can see here us is one of the freezer comes

00:25:40.679 --> 00:25:48.299
you can take it off please um one of the common names and he he says that the street name is asterion

00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:56.700
the common name is asterion you go to the marketplace and you order up some Australians and what is austerion

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:03.900
notice that it's got the Str root that everybody is looking for the Str root

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:12.720
Str Str do you see the Str the word for star is aster

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:20.159
a stereon is star Little Star right give me some little star man I

00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:27.659
need to go where the Aryans go because the scythians we know are into

00:26:27.659 --> 00:26:35.039
the star the citians are into the star they love that star um okay so let's uh uh what can we do

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:42.000
with the star right what can we do with the and why did they call it that because of the one of the reasons

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.779
um uh that is explicitly stated is because of the shape of the leaf yeah that's nice I kind of like that

00:26:48.779 --> 00:26:55.020
five-pointed star thing that's kind of nice not to get too overly satanic Nick

00:26:55.020 --> 00:27:02.279
um uh but there you go there's a nice connection give me that really ferocious look of Satan there oh no that's just

00:27:02.279 --> 00:27:07.740
more star we're transporting into the star there we go there we go that's a

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:14.039
nice one fantastic okay so now I want to take you to some oysters

00:27:14.039 --> 00:27:19.200
a couple people have asked what's the oysters right and please remember that

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:25.020
we are entering an initiation right so these images I want to tell you

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:31.620
to be careful these images could cause you um serious discomfort

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:38.299
serious discomfort yes in a in a series of discomfort as we can get on YouTube

00:27:38.299 --> 00:27:46.020
and still maintain the historical accuracy of our research Bryant we're

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:53.400
scientists here reason first right we don't just jump in Nick remember that

00:27:53.400 --> 00:28:02.120
okay so here we go I want to bring up EOS for us please

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:08.520
ah he asked for us um that's fine that's fine I can do that one

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:15.659
um but we have that one with smaller I want you to bring up this one please yes for us there you go EOS for us right

00:28:15.659 --> 00:28:23.460
look at the Doric Aus photos you like that EOS and aus

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:31.260
um so there's I tell everybody in the Greek class it comes from the verbs and the vowels are really adjusting the or

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:36.720
adjusting kind of fine tuning the root but it's really not the vowels that

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:43.740
matter it's really not the vowels that matter it's the consonants that carry the weight and under certain

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:50.820
circumstances that can change like that first Ada is is a part of the root

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:56.480
so okay here we go um what is this word

00:28:56.659 --> 00:29:02.520
the bringer of mourn say the victorians the morning star and you'll notice that

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.799
it equals hesperos yes and afroditees

00:29:07.799 --> 00:29:13.380
so this morning star or Aphrodite or the

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:20.520
one that four root is carried right the one who carries the dawn I asked you all

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.980
who with the utmost sincerity and I think this area and

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:36.620
exhibition is the perfect place to do it it's the perfect sacrosanct place to spill this Blood

00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:45.059
the mother of Lucifer I heard recently on a podcast a Harvard religious studies

00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:51.059
expert say that it was that it was

00:29:51.059 --> 00:29:57.779
um Lucifer didn't exist right this is a later invention you know etc etc

00:29:57.779 --> 00:30:03.120
um what I'm saying to you is that Lucifer is a Bronze Age that's the

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:09.240
oldest we could we can track him back and he is that carrier of EOS

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:17.480
right he's that carrier of dawn his mother that the mother of

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:23.100
Lucifer is the dawn and for those of you who are interested

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:29.039

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:46.799
and that Saturn is just a d rotified Satan

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:57.600
who said we have a a a Hebrew manuscript right that's the complete edition we're

seder of Saturn yes you have to have satsariasis

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:41.340
by after taking satyrian and why would you take satirian in order

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:48.120
to become a Seder of Saturn why would you do that

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:55.080
because you entered the oysteromania and you are alive

00:32:55.080 --> 00:33:02.100

[Music] I want to show people I've talked about this a little bit before but this this

00:35:14.099 --> 00:35:20.880
is relevant for the Dragon for us understand the dragon and if you notice at the bottom of this definition of Creo

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:26.040
right which um to Rob anoint with scented anguents

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:31.920

with other things it doesn't have to be water right you can wash with oils yeah you can apply things this Cleo is just

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:44.940
the application process but then at the very bottom at the very bottom hi Rob

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:50.900
I'll be with you in a second at the very bottom of this definition

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:56.760
means to be stung by the gadfly

00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:04.220
so the one who was stung by the gadfly that is the Christos

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:11.040
that individual is able to enter oystermania

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.800
and complete the mystery

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:26.000

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:55.859
that naked boy and that means we have to go to some

00:36:55.859 --> 00:37:01.079
pretty awful places and deal with some pretty awful people

00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:07.079
um and and see the reality yes and isn't that

00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:12.180

00:39:53.640 --> 00:40:01.619
which drugs are associated with which rights and and and create this

00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:07.140
um Renaissance of knowledge yeah I totally agree diascortis oh you know

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:14.400
dice Gordy's love it love it good stuff you should do right scrivonius largest too he's the guy who

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:22.760
talks about the witches taking the livers of the Gladiators and picking up their mouths and stuff like that

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:28.800
go ahead whoops turn that off okay I want to take you back to the last

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:34.079
episode yeah a question Lord Snappy asked and he

00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:41.760
he asked and he's asking again and this is through the Discord so he says oh could you ask Eamon to repeat his

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:48.300
academic guess as to who thinks is responsible for turning the Savior figure male

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:55.619
he answered last stream but the internet caught off during his answer and nobody heard it and um I'll put that down to

00:40:55.619 --> 00:41:01.440
like you're profaning and I've noticed as you you have these

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:07.619
cutoffs you know these happenings we've discussed it and um I put it down to

00:41:07.619 --> 00:41:12.900
your profaning over the internet I think you need like there's some sort of

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:18.119
restraint aspect going on but maybe now you can answer that

00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:24.240
question and thank you yeah perhaps that restraining force is being removed

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:32.579
um yes uh it started out right from the beginning right from the beginning after Medea invented the thing right um

00:41:32.579 --> 00:41:39.660
Heracles and his offspring uh took it up took up the cult and converted it into a

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:45.060
masculine form that only she was allowed to to be present for only Medea there's

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:51.000
no woman that's allowed except for Medea there's something special about her and

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.060
since we know that in the mystery she is the cup then we know that there's some

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:02.280
kind of distribution whether it's mirrored in the corporations

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:09.119
and and the uh uh the nicolations whether it's mirrored in them more

00:42:09.119 --> 00:42:14.579
accurately with their semen use in Helen for example and again and contributing

00:42:14.579 --> 00:42:20.099
her scene if that that may be how the right why the right allows this one

00:42:20.099 --> 00:42:25.980
female figure but it is turned to a completely male initiation and it's

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:31.680
pederastic it's a pederastic initiation

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:37.619
um uh so can we turn from the pedophilia no Jesus is arrested in a public park

00:42:37.619 --> 00:42:44.339
for a an Str reason and um Hercules is providing us with the

00:42:44.339 --> 00:42:49.500
very same um the same uh uh example the same

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:56.460
religion it's the derivation um uh the the maturation of the child

00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:01.980
um and in the process you derive the communion you know let this cup pass

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:09.119
right perhaps unpleasant but the it's one of the Avenues so it looks like as a

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:18.480
Bronze Age phenomenon this snap serpent on a pole is is used as a

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:24.660
feminine art that then can be kind of Taken and changed a little bit into a

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:29.819
masculine art and hence and you always have to have naked boys right naked boys

00:43:29.819 --> 00:43:36.119
naked boys right all the naked boys I can't stop educating you about the

00:43:36.119 --> 00:43:43.680
pedophilia in Antiquity we can't um yeah I it's the reason that those

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:50.940
priests that are involved um according to the gentleman the Monsignor that I knew it's the reason

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:56.700
that they're so arrogant and when they get caught in their ways in their

00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:02.460
ritualistic um um rape

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:07.859
of children that they get upset like it's your fault

00:44:07.859 --> 00:44:13.980

that thing that puts you uh and sudden shock that's coming from his eyes the word

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:52.260
dragon the word Dragon comes from the Greek to

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:58.380
see to see and it's a a very common very

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:05.579
common um saying statement that the blind Dragon sees

00:51:05.579 --> 00:51:13.339
yeah I'm parisius for example right seeing the virgin

00:51:13.339 --> 00:51:19.740
tyresia sees the Virgin and the cost is his sight

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:26.520
in return for which she gives him ionic vision

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:31.619
yeah gorgeous um anyway it says it continues to say the dragon is afraid of

00:51:31.619 --> 00:51:37.980
only only Medea Medea alone uh okay so do you feel the cult we kind

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:44.339
of we kind of tried to run in there we tried to run in there with Hercules we tried to sneak in that door and see

00:51:44.339 --> 00:51:50.339
what's going on this is the precursor to Judaism and to Christianity

00:51:50.339 --> 00:51:56.640
this is the mystery that is driving Judaism and Christianity uh okay more

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:02.099
questions we still have a couple of minutes before the hour is up excuse

00:52:02.099 --> 00:52:08.940
pronunciation I'm gonna go with Piero I think um are you are you interested in going

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:18.299
to the pillars of villa Hercules or Heracles just in general there's a discussion

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:25.140
setting up my wheelhouse my idea so interesting and understanding

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:30.180
what that means to be honest yeah yeah the pillars of Heracles and the labors

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:36.540
of Heracles and the opening of the gateway to Atlantis I knew I knew it

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:42.000
would not be too long until somebody brought up Atlantis what is it with

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.520
Atlantis all of a sudden people are people are looking for the thing

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:53.720
yeah what do you think what do you think Rob yeah

00:52:54.300 --> 00:53:00.839
all these things are going to be jiren come up you know this is it's all out there and people read their

00:53:00.839 --> 00:53:07.680
stuff and it comes out a lot the Met back out in that respect is you'll read something

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:15.260
and then you'll repeat the last thing you've read or the last thing you've heard and rather than

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:23.160
rather than thinking about airtime reflecting upon it comprehending

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:29.240
it you move on to the next one and the next one and you see you you start beginning to gather a list of

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:34.380
interesting facts or you really need to

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:39.420
acknowledge what you're reading and reflect both

00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:45.900
because you've got to take that to a higher level in my estimation

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:53.520
that's where I try to do that's that's my goal I think we could safely say that's the

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:59.839
path of Reason isn't it I mean it sounds like you're sounds like you're one of these crazy

00:53:59.839 --> 00:54:06.660
saturnians yeah who follows that reason to its conclusion that's I love that Rob

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:11.940
I love that thank you we've got Brian Ryan

00:59:33.839 --> 00:59:42.839
the position of the Muse so I would say you are very patriarchian with your approach and I believe that

00:59:42.839 --> 00:59:50.280
um it it it smells a fine incense of purification I believe that that I can

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:55.380
smell your purification ah love it love it okay

00:59:55.380 --> 01:00:02.960
a question yeah no how do you think the devil's wall does the trick brother

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.160
would you would you recommend the devil's walk no I've no I have not the

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:15.599
devil's want tell tell us Rob tell us about the devil's walk I'm completely completely unfamiliar

01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:20.880
no you're not you you know who Robert Shelby is you just need to remind him

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:27.020
I'm sure um The Poetry from the Lake District

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:40.079
when we're talking about Byron then I like to also include the devil's

01:00:40.079 --> 01:00:46.740
walk they messed with friends and it was about similar ideas and similar math

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:53.520
preserve laying this down it's it was working man for my understanding he's

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:59.940
they come from a Layman background not privileged and I like it's similar to my

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:06.900
background so I appreciate the terminology he uses and each each

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:12.240
part each each part that you can go into you can it's offering quite a lot of

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:18.780
knowledge that you can research and you'll spend a good deal of time appreciating if you go for the

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:25.380
reach whatever it's called does this dead does this dead man lead

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:30.660
us to the lead us to the Virgin who's half Viper in the cave does he lead us

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:36.780
to her well in part in party early goes It goes in part but

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:42.299
for me to give me a better impression of the world and now it's

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:49.980
sponge essentially that that was the reason I got out of that

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:56.460
out of the devil's room anyway I just want to sit here suggested

01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:01.740
for those for those of you who want to to read and discuss I encourage you and

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:08.579
that'll be something good for the for the um the Inquisition or what is it called

01:02:08.579 --> 01:02:16.040
um we talked about getting bit by the gadfly I get bitten by the the don't fly

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:22.200
when live streamers in in the mix yeah

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:30.720
Rob that's a that's a Discord discussion though you need to bring that up resurrect these guys for the people to

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.940
see you've been working with numerous authors and I mean Mary Shelley is out

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:42.059
there for all of you women um specifically who want to hear the the

01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:47.760
voice and it's most clear or what they call in Greek liguea

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:55.020
um you can either read Edgar Allan Poe's Liga or um Mary Shelley and you've been you've

01:02:55.020 --> 01:03:00.180
been working with Mary Shelley Ron what what can you tell us about I mean I

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:07.559
heard she crept into the caves at Kumai and she was able to find um the leaves upon which were written

01:03:07.559 --> 01:03:14.040
the oracles and that she was able to rearrange those into a story

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:19.200
um I mean there's a reason that Frankenstein is Prometheus

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:26.880
right I mean wow what's going she wrote she wrote Frankenstein while in the

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:32.640
company of Byron and then the company of Percy it was the the whole the kind of

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:40.079
competition and that writer in a cult story something off the wall and an 18

01:03:40.079 --> 01:03:47.760
year old man Shelley came up with this frankenstad story in that competition one competition that

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.700
is real um but she's the history of Mary Shelley

01:03:53.700 --> 01:04:00.359
her mother the father very interesting story very interesting route to go down and you can see why I think she was

01:04:00.359 --> 01:04:08.460
attractive it's a it's a very very very interesting narrative and you put me onto Percy

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:11.838
through the queen mum

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:20.700
found a cave yeah yeah you're finally I really

01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:27.020
enjoyed the last man I can't think of anything

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:33.000
at the time I've got um orgies of words

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.299
at the time which is revealing known as his mystery terminology or

01:04:39.299 --> 01:04:44.819
supposedly doesn't go deep enough in my life what went deeper for my liking was the

01:04:44.819 --> 01:04:50.760
last man I was reading that and listening to an audio book and when

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:56.160
I went to the last man audio group I was receiving more mystery information than

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:01.260
I was in it textbook that's out there to to reveal

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:06.480
mystery to Immunology it was just quite astonishing that how much information

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:13.680
Mary shall we gives him that novel because you're devoted that's perfect perfect wrap-up

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:21.900
because you're devoted to the Muse right do you see what he did you see what the Satanist did oh congregation do you see

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:28.079
the Satanist with his shaved head um do you see what he did he worships

01:05:28.079 --> 01:05:38.520
The Muse and follows her and she explains to and shows him a reality

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:46.440
that allows him to be awake um he's able to understand in a way he's

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.400
able to understand

01:05:52.520 --> 01:06:00.240
normally isn't can we bring up um Rob just because you said that and just because the commenter Nick said the

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:06.480
commenter of the day said um uh about the pedophilia can we get away from the

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:12.299
pedophilia just because he said that can we end with

01:06:12.299 --> 01:06:17.700
um the devil and pedophilia is that is that okay let's go where are we going to

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:23.099
go in in this text I'm going to bring it up to you and it is oh you're gonna love

01:06:23.099 --> 01:06:29.400
this it is I don't I only remembered it Rob because you brought up nonus and

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:35.339
nobody ever talks about nonus right it's these two lines please the upo lines

01:06:35.339 --> 01:06:41.059
thank you Chewie I wouldn't be able to do this without you yeah yeah

01:06:41.059 --> 01:06:46.079
thank you um look at these lines and Rob this is

01:06:46.079 --> 01:06:53.660
this is taken right out of the heart of the bacchic satanism

01:06:55.319 --> 01:06:57.920
um age

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:08.940
on foreign austere there's our word for Star isn't that nice Aster at the end of

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:15.660
that line EOS photos

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:21.660
nice then that's the end of this the sentence so not yet what does this

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:27.500
translate into not yet has my star

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:36.119
arrived or been drawn having bathed in the outpouring having

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:45.140
Bay having been bathed in those Waters not yet has EOS

01:07:45.319 --> 01:07:54.740
not yet has the bringer of dawn shown His Holy Light

01:07:55.260 --> 01:08:00.539
yeah isn't that nice this is directly you can remove it now this is directly

01:08:00.539 --> 01:08:07.680
and why do I say there's pedophilia this is the derivation of EOS for us from the

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:14.099
waters in rev in the book of the Apocalypse the Revelation you will all you will all be familiar with because

01:08:14.099 --> 01:08:19.318
then well maybe not everybody but a lot of people will be familiar with

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:25.679
um the dragon's use of the waters and what that means now if you go back

01:08:25.679 --> 01:08:34.560
and look at it in the book of the Apocalypse Now it will suddenly start to make sense I am profaning for you this

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:41.940
mystery so that you can make sense of it not yet has the Morning Star

01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:48.719
been drawn from the waters yeah what is that Holy lion that is that

01:08:48.719 --> 01:08:55.620
is that is penetrating our hexametric oracular wisdom oh isn't that nice

01:08:55.620 --> 01:09:00.660
where's the connection with the pedophilia this is in a section that has

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:06.960
to do with the boy lover of Apollo the sun god

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:12.380
remember we're in the astral religion now with the saturnian cult

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:17.880
this is the Sun God we're talking about and of course if we're going to talk

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:25.798
about Dawn Dawn is the culmination of the entire cycle it is everything that

01:09:25.799 --> 01:09:32.818
the great mother represents are you kidding me you mean Lucifer represents

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:41.338
the is the bringer of the great mother yes yes the bringer of dawn it's oh it's

01:09:41.339 --> 01:09:47.880
it's it's simply where was that exit from

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:55.980
oh that was book 11. that was book 11 of known as in his dionysiaka which is the

01:09:55.980 --> 01:10:03.000
war like the one we had tonight when dionitus went over to India and fought

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:10.260
the gods of India and brought them drunkenness and ecstasy and you'll say

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:16.560
oh that's the Soma plant and what about the salmon yeah right right jump in there dive around get into that cult

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:22.820
stuff all right who's gonna is anybody gonna read the antidotes

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:29.460
we need to do it okay I think we've had I can't waste more than much more than

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:35.040
an hour of people's time I don't want to give a quick shout out to Nancy

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:41.880
Divine she's she's reading Byron loving Byron please please what does Nancy say what

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:48.480
does Nancy say I've got to read more Byron reread is what I mean what's to think

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:56.460
about it and exquisite language and rereading is amazing which dude I I appreciate because you

01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:02.400
miss things on the first reading the second reading you go back to the third reading the fourth really reading and

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:09.420
there's so much depth to these to these texts you can keep it busy for hours if

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:18.420
you need busy grounds and I appreciate what Nancy's doing she's she's engaging with the Jackson

01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:23.460
recognition um she's she's following the way she's

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:28.560
following the way and she's using necromantic techniques to do so she is

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:34.219
raising the dead in in honoring the Muse yeah yeah

01:11:34.219 --> 01:11:39.540
I'm afraid I do want one more time to bring up can

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:47.040
you bring up the name of the Dragon for the people this will be the last thing that I throw in but for the people who

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:52.320
um can't really visualize the dragon because your mind is stuck in Tolkien

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:59.280
and you're thinking dragons from Tolkien right um who by the way is a thief but you

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:04.380
know many of the Best Authors are um so uh you're thinking this Dragon I

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:11.940
want you to see this is not this is not that Dragon this is an individual and

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:18.440
what you have on the screen in front of you or what are called the orphic gramata

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:23.760
these are the orphic writings or the orphic letters

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:32.659
and our text tells us that this is the name this is what the dragon is called

01:12:32.659 --> 01:12:39.179
if you could translate this you would be able to possess if you could translate

01:12:39.179 --> 01:12:46.580
this you would have the image that is in the name and with the image of the name you would be able to possess the power

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:54.239
of the Dragon Isn't that cool that's one of the coolest things I've ever seen right out of antiquity people right out

01:12:54.239 --> 01:13:01.199
of antiquity do the scholars at Harvard do this stuff no they don't

01:13:01.199 --> 01:13:09.440
right do they do the medicine no they don't right the same

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.620
next time

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:28.040

have asked me to show them a magical operation

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:06.540
or to bring it to an accessible point it's the same thing to keep uh uh uh the

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:13.440
question about the asking if I will do the sortes um uh in front of you visibly

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:21.300
