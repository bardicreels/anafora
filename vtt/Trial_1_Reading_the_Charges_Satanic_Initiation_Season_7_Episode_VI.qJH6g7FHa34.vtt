events a psyche was set upon and battered in an aggravated manner in a

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.879
manner to cause bro gross gross and irreversible psychic

next two charges are kind of a bundle um you know we need a commentator here to

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.639
tell us um what we have instead is the authority bringing the charges the

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:25.560
transdimensional criminal conspiracy is a plurality that is working together

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.599
within a racketeering Force that's why the next

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:37.800
charge is necromantic racketeering a very specific form of

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:44.520
racketeering involving necromantic practices res

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:52.080
resurrections from the dead death States the casting out of the forces of nature

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:59.080
I.E demons the healings and the bringing of life These

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:04.840
are draw necromantic um for practices that we are

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:12.639
going to show are used within a scheme of racketeering on those two charges the

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:19.080
second and third charge thank you can you present the next apocalyptic assault

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:26.680
and this isn't just felonious assault this is assault in the cosmic first

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:33.360
degree yes this is an extra chronic

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:40.919
assault we have to show intent we have to show purpose we have to show that

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:46.839
there was something achieved outside of time first

00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:54.720
degree we have to show that The Noose the mind was outside of

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.720
Kronos fantastic let's go to the next one quantum obst destruction of Justice

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.200
right this is this one's pretty self-explanatory people get this one um

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:12.600
we as precut um of this case we tend to um

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:18.320
bring that out it's my plan to bring that out I will show you it's my job

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.040
however this is just the announcement of the charges Quantum obstruction of justice yes

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:30.360
anytime anytime within the cosmic court anytime

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.600
that you have an obstruction of justice you're um dealing with a matter that um

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:42.279
is always taken of the to the nth degree we know the mandatory sentencing laws

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:48.360
that apply of course to Quantum obstruction um they're pretty severe so

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.399
this is a very serious charge why we're dropping it down here and finally what

00:09:53.399 --> 00:10:02.839
we find the most egregious is is this false ionic

00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:08.399
imprisonment um this is a contrary to

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:17.680
one's will holding this is a forcing someone outside of The Chronic

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:24.440
stream to be bound yes it is a form of trafficking it

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:29.640
falls within the trafficking laws um of the last

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:37.880
12th dimensional contract I think it was yeah anywh who false cionic imprisonment

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.440
right and you'll see these are the charges and what we

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:51.440
have to do is we have to bring the jury the proper evidence we don't want you to

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:58.160
come to conclusions without the evidence this is why our jury system is

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:04.200
so Superior ior it's so Superior right can you smell that can you smell that

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:13.000
ancient courtroom with 300 jurors in Athens and they're all screaming and sweaty and moving around you know it's

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:52.440
and the sources I want to bring up tonight um the tail end of what we did last night and is it connected and is it

00:15:52.440 --> 00:16:00.480
all part of the same Venture yes it is it turns out we're talking about a section of non Us's paraphrase of John

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:07.600
and he's saying that there are these two Maria and Maria and one of them is the

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:14.440
mother who produces the goddess right and we talked a few episodes ago about

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:22.720
it being feminine why is Jesus the represented as feminine um in nness well

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:29.839
you know he's just trying to meet meter and it's just the Whitten well that could be it could also be that they're

00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:36.360
associating this production of a female goddess with Mary the Virgin right and

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:43.079
there's Mary Magdalene here it says right in Jesus he's hanging on that cross and he's looking down at that kid

00:16:43.079 --> 00:16:51.079
that he loves that little kid who is the theop right the God child oh look

00:16:51.079 --> 00:16:59.959
there's the God child right right you're about to get some of that psychic battery people um M mus and Alex said oh

00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:08.000

don't make it ugly it's the he say students um he says hey um um you ver

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:34.640
and he uses a feminine there huh says in a minute he's never going to produce

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:41.840

delicate breasts it causes this shining it's a it's a Marvel to see okay take it

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:48.599
down so you can see what the Greeks in this Archaic Period well

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:55.960
things that they're really focusing on and um what are the a adola the images

00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:01.319
that they're using and how those are affecting their rights and they're using

00:48:01.319 --> 00:48:08.400
her image um and that image is it should you should understand that there is a

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:14.119
comfort in that image that is maternal and the Romans found it they they called

00:48:14.119 --> 00:48:21.760
her the genetrix right which is like it's almost like saying the great mother it's not the magnam mat but it's almost

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:27.599
like saying the great mother it's the producer the project Ator um she who

00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:33.599
brought us everything remember behind Rome is a she right behind Rome is a she

00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:41.319
this feminine Force can't be overcome it can only be repressed

00:48:41.319 --> 00:48:47.359
temporarily ultimately it will bust forward it will burst out

00:48:47.359 --> 00:48:53.960
ripe and the world will be full of that bloom that radiating Bloom it's a

00:48:53.960 --> 00:49:01.960

00:49:22.599 --> 00:49:27.920
compelled by the hormones it's this and I use hormones on purpose because it's

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:34.559

siren this is that siren you can't plug your ears man plug your ears or you will

01:03:19.119 --> 01:03:26.119
get sucked in right Pastor John you're your reason that we have the

01:03:26.119 --> 01:03:31.720
sisters of frustration right and that we have people who are

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:40.440
abused right priests pastors Ministers of Christ the reasons people have been

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:46.359
abused didn't you think you were going to be held responsible didn't you think

01:03:46.359 --> 01:03:54.599
DK was a reality I know you didn't well she is watch this let's go

01:03:54.599 --> 01:03:59.920

yeah look if you can't control yourself says Paul go ahead and make make like you're entering

01:04:08.039 --> 01:04:16.880
a gamos a union right yeah why because are you ready for

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:23.640
this this is an attempt to assassinate a Divinity and that Divinity is Aphrodite

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:29.640
Paul is sh shooting directly at her are you ready he says it is better to

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:37.880
goo than to burn wait wait what what it's better to

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:45.279
enter into intercourse than to burn what are you recognizing Paul

01:04:45.279 --> 01:04:50.839
sounds to me like a statement of defeat sounds to me like the side of

01:04:50.839 --> 01:04:56.599
Christianity that you push forward couldn't figure out a way to defeat the poor

01:04:56.599 --> 01:05:02.680
NAA you mean you didn't find it you know the feelings you know the feelings all

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:08.160
we have to do is give you that image of that beauty and you're a slave you call

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:13.520
yourself a Christian but you can't stand against that power you know you can't

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:19.440
it's within you it's within you you won't be able to go to sleep unless you

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:26.079
can come to that place unless you can be there with

01:05:26.079 --> 01:05:33.839
her we all know what the Mysteries are about it's about bringing Eve we know

01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:42.920
it's about bringing Eve devil was supposed to guard right ultimately he did he kept

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:49.400
the way open to the tree yeah last let's go to last Paul um

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:57.920
Second and last get get um yep um yeah uh uh don't be slay no that's yeah look

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:03.880
he's telling him you people what does Paul tell his own fraking people he says you've been bought out of the slave

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:08.920
market right right it makes sense it makes sense that the dude who's

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:16.520
perpetuating something that was the the idea of the grand leace right and has now has full funding

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:23.240
Peter James and John are collecting the business is going it makes it makes perfect sense that he's telling the

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:31.520
followers hey you you've been you've been bought out of a Marketplace bro right yeah don't be slaves of Mortals

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:37.799
right don't be slaves people you're purchased we got you and what does that

01:06:37.799 --> 01:06:45.359
have to do with any you keep going last one yeah um what do we do then is these purchase

01:06:45.359 --> 01:06:50.920
slaves Paul tell us because the Temple of Aphrodite is right next door and to

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:56.200
be honest um I can't take your BS any anymore I'm about to go over there and

01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:02.720
have my brain cleansed from your misogynistic garbage tell me Paul tell

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:10.640
me please give me the advice what what does Christianity have to do with

01:07:14.119 --> 01:07:19.599
Aphrodite if you are bound to a

01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:25.480
woman don't try to be Unbound if you are

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:34.039
not if you are freed from woman don't look for

01:07:37.359 --> 01:07:43.079
one and that is how a god becomes a

01:07:43.079 --> 01:07:48.880
victim of assassination yeah and you and I sit you

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:57.599
and I sit underneath this aggravated battery where's my charge aggravated

01:07:57.599 --> 01:08:02.720
battery boom this is where you and I sit

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:09.640
underneath the aggravated battery and we absorb our concepts of the world around

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:15.120
us our concepts of love our concepts of sex we

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:24.640
absorb via your battery your misogyny we absorb it and we too want to

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:30.520
hate her the great Queen but you my friend you my friend have come up

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:37.318
against the wrong wrong woman let's go to the I just want to remind us of the charges tonight we talk we're gonna

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:45.238
we're gonna um we're gonna mention it tonight I just want the press cycle to enter in Oh look The the grand jury

01:08:45.239 --> 01:08:50.798
brought forth indictments um we are charging with transdimensional criminal

01:08:50.799 --> 01:08:57.400
conspiracy and I will strive to show over the next three sessions um exactly

01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:03.560
that that that um they have indeed formed a conspiracy and with Criminal

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:09.960
Intent and that this next this involves racketeering specifically necromantic

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:18.880
racketeering of a resurrection and death sort um using Pro um

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:24.798
propit profit motivated practices profit motivated

01:09:24.799 --> 01:09:29.880
practices now um our standards will be different right this is not typically

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:35.120
what you would have in a human Court our standards go to the core of the person

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:41.318
right if we're going to serve de serve DK we have to go to the core we have to go to that

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:49.440
reality good and apocalyptic assault um we'll talk about we'll talk about what

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:55.560
kind of what kind of assault is apocalyptic it's a specific form it's a

01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:02.400
specific form and it is [Music] setting it is setting what you would

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.679
call your mind in a state of expectation

01:10:07.679 --> 01:10:15.640
of Apocalypse it's something that people do to psychically kidnap you yes love it

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:20.960
which brings us um before the obstruction go to the final to the false

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:27.440
imprisonment the false imprisonment um and we'll show how this false ionic

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:32.800
imprisonment ultimately ultimately um obstructs

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:40.080
Justice and you think what the obstruction of justice that's just a minor that's something you get liing ore

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.400
joh right that's something you just it's a minor no it turns out in the cosmic

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:53.719
Court obstruction of justice is Everything is Everything so behind all

01:10:53.719 --> 01:11:00.920
of your crimes Petty right or not

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:08.960
Petty behind all of your crimes is a form of the obstruction of justice that

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:16.840
is the true dark matter that must be purged in this case against Jesus Christ

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:22.000
that we take up for the next three sessions I will show

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.320
you that Jesus Jus Christ was guilty of

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:35.560
multiple multiple statutes laws common

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.920
sense that Jesus Christ is not himself a

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:48.400
victim but a perpetrator that he portrays himself

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:56.080
through his criminal conspiracy with the

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:03.320
brand of a victim while being a perpetrator we will

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:09.679
show in court that Jesus Christ the

01:12:09.679 --> 01:12:15.040
leace was in fact purposefully and

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:20.080
intentionally plotting to

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:27.520
obtain the most extra terrestrial

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:38.000
power since Adolf Hitler yeah yeah yeah will show that

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.719
what you deem to be the innocent is that unjust and

01:12:45.719 --> 01:12:53.199
crooked and how are we going to do this every what you're crazy right it's crazy

01:12:53.199 --> 01:12:59.320
um it is but we're we can do it and the exciting way we can do it is through the

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:06.360
necromancy of bringing back Jesus I will bring

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:12.840
Jesus back to answer questions

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:18.480
directly directly you will hear from his voice ladies and gentlemen on the jury

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:24.199
you will hear from his voice and from this I hope that you are able

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:30.760
to come to a verdict of guilty thank you we will see you with

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:38.000
