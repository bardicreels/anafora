00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.960
most interesting interviews I've ever listened to about all of this this man is dangerous to the current leaders of

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.120
Rel of religions the world over almond Hillman should be taken very seriously

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.400
it sounds ominous doesn't it but the point here is exactly is exactly on I

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.960
shouldn't be taking uh uh you know people shouldn't be looking at me but these texts reveal

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.479
a completely different world than the religious world that you and I have had

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:03.840
pulled over our eyes yeah it's a new world baby let's look at

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.599
it through the um where are the clips did we put the Clips in there oh we need another one so's like shut up um gecko

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:19.919
boy gecko we love geckos um he did his PhD under stavra Kulu oh right and

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.400
that's the modern Greek that I heard in his in his accent of course in ancient

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:32.120
Greek um I'm about halfway through her book God isn't that amazing amazing what's your book going to be

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.639
called God we're going to find him tonight are you ready the number of times the 6th

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:45.160
Century BCE is mentioned but never a source right right number of times it's

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.599
mention but never a source um your guy is full of it yeah thank you um what is

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:57.280
that there was a very important point that I wanted to bring out for people we do not care about theories we don't care

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.120
about word salads here we care about what the evidence is showing us the reality that's exactly what people are

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:12.759
hitting on it's nothing to do with me it's everything to do with The Muse the dragon guards that song that's it it's

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:19.639
the one job give it to me what's the oh let's hit Dan come here Dan it's time for Dan

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:25.759
let me take a couple of these clips and people this is not personal this is not

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:33.120
personal this is professional this is the guy that you see tonight who went to dozens of

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.840
professional conferences where people who have been studying ancient Greek and

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:45.840
Latin all their lives they come in and they they uh they

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:53.479
wrestle and you can't mess around man you cannot mess around that's what this is about I don't want anybody getting

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:59.240
taken into the back alley good let's go for it give me a Dan I want to suck this

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:06.520
up go and then there are um there are 79,900 like 45 words in Hebrew in the

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.599
Hebrew Bible alone so 79,000 79,000 yeah so I think he may have heard 80,000

00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:18.440
somewhere he said eight yeah I think he may have Mook ad48 cuz there the Hebrew

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:24.520
Bible itself which is not all of ancient Hebrew like there's there was a lot of Hebrew writing in speaking outside the

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:31.400
Hebrew Bible but the Hebrew Bible itself has 880,000 different words in it

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.959
um right so who was confused there we all know it was DuckTales Dan and he

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:41.919
said something that was way off I don't know where he got

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:49.240
79,90 I don't know where he got those he pulled those out of some dark vaporous

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.360
black hole somewhere because that's not the that that look people what's the point of

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:02.640
this um this is not just a game when you're presenting history to

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:08.440
someone and you misrepresent it uh that's

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:16.000
unsacred that that's something that's befouling the planet we have to honor the Muse of

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.920
History her name is Cleo Dan her name is Cleo give us the next one he did correct

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.800
me on something there I said it was limited to classical and early Greek lyrical poetry but it's also in

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.279
classical and early Greek uh medical texts and and he pointed that out so oh

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:38.680
he did yeah now that has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the claim that

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:45.880
that's what it means in the New Testament but um okay but it is in medical

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.959
text okay did you hear the voice of reasoning sneaking in there and the

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:59.399
Renaissance a champion coming out of Danny Jones did you hear that yeah no

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:05.120
DuckTales Danny is going to continue leading down this road of

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.399
deception right it's when you take the sources and you cram them in the

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:16.079
person's face that's when that's when you know you're in the right place you

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:21.200
as a classicist have done your job you've just guarded the sources we don't

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:30.640
want to hear what you think I'm sorry Dr P and Dr L Oxford Yale we don't care

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:36.279
in the slightest what you think we want to know what the evidence

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:42.440
is and we want to understand it for ourselves because we're Servants of the Muse of

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:50.200
History right um watch what's happening a couple more let's give a couple more go okay um what is the difference

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:56.120
between a a classical scholar and a Biblical scholar so uh a person who

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:02.399
studies Classics is primarily engaging in the the Greek and the Latin literature from the middle of the first

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:08.880
millennium BCE down into the first few centuries CE and and I use BCE and CE

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:16.079
where people use BC and AD um and so Classics doesn't really have uh a ton of

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:23.320
overlap with the Bible but the the people who wrote and transmitted and consumed the New Testament and as well

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:29.480
as the septu agent were also people engaged with classical literature and there's a lot of influence from classics

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.639
on uh the Bible that's not too bad he's he's only

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:41.160
off about 500 years so um classical philology is the study of Greek and

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.839
Latin and um our earliest sources are not in the fifth century right you've

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:52.279
missed half the boat right now what are you watching happen this man is an

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:58.000
expert who makes his living off of being an

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.279
expert when where is the responsibility to the Muse where's the

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:11.680
responsibility that we have we have an obligation to be accurate and all you

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.199
nerdy engineers and all you nerdy computer programmers you all understand

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:23.199
that the mathematicians that's the draw oh God we love it the musicians are even

00:12:23.199 --> 00:12:28.920
they don't even understand right they're the musicians I love it but what's the

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:36.440
um he's off in the amount of time that we study but he also makes it sound like um

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:44.760
we don't study the Bible because we just do classical stuff right in Dan's mind

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:51.040
in the mind that works at the University in the mind that works at the

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:59.800
Seminary there is a division and space and time between pagans and non pagans

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:05.480
monest monest live in their own Universe right we all know that's not

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:13.440
true and that's why studying the Bible is part of studying Classics right okay isn't it it's

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:21.240
terrible misrepresentation of the actual science my God

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.800
man give me the next one that second sense revolutionary insurrectionist that's the kind of sense that would

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.920
could Merit crucifixion oh that's not even here here you said yeah where did you find the Revolutionary so I'm I'm

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.760
looking in uh what what Scholars affectionately know as bag which is a a Greek English lexicon of the New

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:45.240
Testament and other early Christian literature so it isolates the usage of these words within early Christian

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:50.839
literature to show how they're being used in those contexts yeah but wouldn't that kind of be a bias translation if

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:57.839
they if they don't if they Jesus is saying he's not a l St they wouldn't want Jesus to be saying he's not a a a

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:03.959
predator look Danny Jones right he got it he saw right through it what's the

00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:12.600
source that you're using Dan mlen you're using a source that was created by a

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.000
specific group with specific types of

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
agendas and those words are going to be defined with their agendas in

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.720
mind you claim to be a translator Dan you should know that

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:38.320
yeah so what do you do what do you do you don't listen to those ideas you go

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:44.959
to the text you go to the sources and you look at them you say what do they say now the reason I want wanted to harp

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:54.440
on this is I want everybody to see this is typical medieval Dark Age

00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:00.240
crappy classical studies is the

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:08.839
antidote to that death of the Dark Ages to that stuff that oozes oozes all over

00:15:08.839 --> 00:15:16.160
your equipment knocks it out your Society H slows down stops progressing

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.880
and starts thinking things that are wild wild we don't go around the

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:31.199
Sun God created this place right okay the antidote is that

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:37.199
classical wisdom and all it is is beautiful beautiful reason expressed by

00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:44.560
a language that just I'm sorry I'm sorry ladies I'm sorry Latin I'm sorry she's

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.120
the most beautiful by far by far now

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.880
people are wondering how many total words does Greek have right um last time

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:02.959
they checked in the tlg the giant Corpus has 1.77 million they used to say 20

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:08.759
years ago they used to say oh it's probably around 500,000 right now they're saying well

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:17.279
with the tlg it looks like it's much much higher that doesn't surprise anyone if you've done anything with this

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:23.399
gorgeous gorgeous pageant winner I'm sorry I'm sorry I hate to say that right

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:33.160
I really hate to say that but um she wins hands down hands down let's

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.480
just all recognize that it's why you have grammar yes it's why you even ask

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:44.600
questions about your language yes you know you do that in Greek right you just don't realize it because you've stolen

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:53.560
Greek right you speak this bastardized anglosaxon garble goop listen to that like listen

00:16:53.560 --> 00:17:00.079
to my inability to find an Anglo-Saxon word that can reach that distant star

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:06.760
and pull her down okay it's gonna get gross now put your Splash bags on wait we got one more Dan hit me last one of

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.918
Dan are you familiar with Lucian uh not not very familiar now it's

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:18.480
been a while so he wrote a he wrote um Lucian was another example of a writer I

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:26.240
think this was like 150 I could be wrong here Steve you have to fact check me on this I think it was like 150 BC Lucian

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:32.080
was a a poet and he wrote a story about a guy named Alexander the false prophet

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.799
who was a l um and he's using the he's using the

00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:44.160
context to how Alexander the context that Lucian uses to describe this guy Alexander the false prophet as this

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.880
terrible tyranical Lac who's trafficking people and and and uses using them as

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:55.240
like proost putting them into like prostitution rings and all kinds of stuff um I think he's using that for the

00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:02.400
main historical context for um that passage in Mark where Jesus says I'm not a la days yeah that's so that wouldn't

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:09.720
be relevant to what was going on on the ground in in uh that part of the world because it's it's we're we're talking uh

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:15.200
200 years later 200 plus years later and a different part of the world and and a

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.320
different uh type of literature alog together um can you Google Lucian so we

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:29.039
can actually get the real story about what his deal was yeah so so this is saying he was 125 to 180 ad mhm right

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:35.120
okay so roughly about 100 and something 100 years in change after well less than

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:44.840
uh less than that for the actual composition of the gospels so there gospels are are 75 70 CE to maybe 125 CE

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:52.480
oh really okay yeah so that's so around the same time closer in time yeah it's it's much similar but

00:18:53.200 --> 00:19:00.400
um so it turns out look you know there are certain

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:07.200
advantages of being able to open portals um look at how it worked out

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:13.919
originally the thought was first of all he didn't know who Lucian was right that's pretty you know okay he was only

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:20.559
a minor in classical Greek so H he probably didn't have that he probably had like one semester and it was like a

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:29.000
survey and they probably didn't do Luan right right this isn't a dude who's been reading Greek for the last 35 years

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.120
right or however long he's been out of training I don't know I don't know um

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:41.080
yeah but do you hear it people of am and you do you hear the

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:47.880
grade of professional Behavior do you hear the level of what it is either

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:54.400
rising to or falling to yeah do you hear that okay Lucian you

00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:00.919
don't know him okay well you think here's the question then tell me why the lace days in Lucian is so different from

00:20:00.919 --> 00:20:08.880
the lace days in Jesus's mouth in Matthew and Luke tell me we talk about

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:14.480
the lace days those two that hung with him uh the Lacey that are hanging next

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:21.440
to him uh in Mark that one's in Mark tell me what's the difference well it

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:29.600
Dan says look that's 200 years difference because he's thanks because he doesn't know watch how quickly

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:36.640
someone in a trench coat is willing to embrace a fabrication right he doesn't

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.679
know he's not from the second century he's from uh BC he's from the second

00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:48.400
century a right and early and that for that

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:54.880
matter yeah what's going to happen then well Dan's going to discover he's he's

00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:01.280
going to discover that he's going to have to scoop up up that pile of Boop

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:10.559
that he just defecated in front of you yeah okay do you want to get your

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:15.600
science from someone who is willing to

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.960
engage fiction I don't I don't want somebody

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.520
like that testifying in court either this is the classical standard

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:32.799
and classical philologists will hold you to this don't BS me I don't want to hear

00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:38.919
your stupid ideas what's your text yeah it becomes annoying after a

00:21:38.919 --> 00:21:46.080

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:54.440
far right and what does it mean to suffer the effects of drugs or

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:59.799
charms suffer the effects of drugs or charms usually the sex drugs are the

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:05.559
ones they're talking about when the victorians translated is charms charms

00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:11.320
make things excitable are you Charmed look at number

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:17.399
two require a remedy so wait a minute you mean it means the action of suffering the

00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:22.559
effects of a drug also means to require

00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:28.159
a remedy do you see what's going on in the ancient Pharmacy and this is what I love telling people most because no body

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:35.600
studies this it's fun the pharmacy is complex polypharmaceutical so they're

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:41.440
using a bunch of drugs to combine with to make one drug that they can use to

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:49.600
fight another drug it's not fighting it it's balancing it did you want to see the Visions let's

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:56.760

most people you know they they want the goodies this is a spell for a man to

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:25.880
obtain a male lover now normally what I do is I bring you our ancient text in

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.960
Greek but this one is Coptic and I don't

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:37.480
even look at Coptic so I wouldn't dare right I learned my lesson from watching

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:44.159
Alan and Dan right if you don't study that language don't say anything about it because you're G to look really goofy

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:50.760
When the tide turns and all of a sudden the guy's contemporary and you should know the term lay stat it's exactly the

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:57.559
same time they're writing the gospels is it relevant yeah it is well

00:31:57.559 --> 00:32:04.840
the thing Dan said is he can't be in the same region right it's from a different part of the world no it's not Lucian was

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:13.960
ass Syrian who ends up in Egypt that's exactly surrounding Judea

egina this is him and he's a physician he's a physician a Byzantine physician

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.160
he's not just a Byzantine physician he's an encyclopedist or he's a he's somebody

00:39:50.599 --> 00:39:55.640
crazy uh species that they're dealing with you know the first one is you know

00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:01.839
you're guarding against the just in general poison like things that are poisonous but he goes through this list

00:40:01.839 --> 00:40:09.560
and you're going to see a whole bunch of spiders and snakes scorpions right oh just a whole bunch of

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:15.000
different types of Venoms oh my God there's the there's the one they're using in the religious rights that make

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:42.800
can drive out of your mind you can be driven out of your senses right there's a there's a whole

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:49.760
set of vocabulary that is influenced by medicine and Antiquity right and that

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:56.480
doesn't live behind a wall like um you're not I'm not talking about the same thing as going to a hospital and

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.920
listening to doctors using their own jargon right I'm not talking about that

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:07.200
I'm talking about the common person in the street has no barrier of separation

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:12.680
between these words in Greek that are highly highly charged medical words and

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.760
any other use of them that's not MediCal there is no separation when you say

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:24.200
Christ you are envisioning a drug that is stinging you

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:30.720
to Madness that is the Christ okay the Christ is stung to Madness and

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:37.960
we have examples of it outside Jesus right we looked at media we looked at her her whole business right good she's

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:44.040
the founder right she's the one who made it and can I just say for those of you who are concerned for the

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:50.920
virgins I know you're concerned for the virgins and you understand that Jesus

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:59.920
Christ was performing actions that were contrary and that to tradition of the

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:06.760
orphic Mysteries because you you know you don't want to go there you don't want to be there with that boy that

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:12.240
Jesus is arrested with you don't want to be performing those acts that Jesus is

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:17.599
performing on the boy just like he didn't want to oh take it away from

00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:23.559
me right you get this do you understand that as you go into the desert and have

00:42:23.559 --> 00:42:31.000
access to Satan you understand why the trial is so heavy it's so heavy let's watch a

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.800
couple of these idiots go through this right give me the here we go now look

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.839
Paul says here he is everybody here's Paul he's about to do his thing you

00:42:41.839 --> 00:42:47.079
thought it would be preaching or maybe an ice cream social no no no he's gonna

00:42:47.079 --> 00:42:53.559
get ripped with a dude intimate intimately ripped and he's

00:42:53.559 --> 00:42:59.839
going to fly to the third heaven you ever been to the third heaven oh God

00:42:59.839 --> 00:43:05.280
what does he say he says I don't mean to brag right from all of these Visions I

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:11.640
don't mean to brag right but because nobody should

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:16.680
brag I was given a skops in my flesh I

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:22.000
was given a thorn in My Flesh and you know what that thorn is that thorn is an

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:32.079
Angulo satana wait did did Paul just say by way of a skops he has access to an

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:40.119
angel called Satan this isn't an angel of Satan this is an Satan

00:43:40.119 --> 00:43:45.800
Angel oh do you know what that is he's sitting on the

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:53.160
throne in order why why is he given this because God likes to slap him around he

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:58.599
likes to slap him around give me the next one okay are you

00:43:58.599 --> 00:44:05.359
there we're we're we're getting crazy with Paul don't worry about it what is that skops it's anything pointed yeah

00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:10.960
that's why I say Thorn right and they say Thorn too look at the very middle of this page

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:18.160
though under number two if you look at the Greek on the third line it says scolopes that's the plural right Thorns

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:25.200
what kind of thorns fos do you know what kind of thorns you take that gets you to the third heaven

like why do we have to have the sexual part Paul's dirty bro to's dirty dirty

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:53.680

see you want to see it happening watch this give me the one that we ski go down

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:48.359
yeah maybe that one there it is who is this that we're talking about

00:45:48.359 --> 00:45:54.160
let's just read it together blow it up chewy yet I am cyprien the great

00:45:54.160 --> 00:46:03.000
magician this is third century who was the friend of the Dragon of the

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:09.559
Abyss what he called me his son and I called him father he placed his crown

00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:17.280
and his diadem on my head I suckled milk at his right breast and all of you

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:22.400
looked at me when I told you Jesus Christ is wearing a

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:30.760
bra like what it's because he gives milk baby he gives

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:38.599
milk now this next part I can't vouch for this next part right he made me a place at his right hand that sounds cool

00:46:38.599 --> 00:46:44.040
but he subjected me to every Power of his I'm not quite sure what that means

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:50.160
and if you were if you told me what what's he G to do to me well first you're going to this and then he's going

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:57.440
to subject you to every form of power he's got I don't know I don't know

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:02.920
I ascended what happened Paul this is this is not Paul this is cyprian no no

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:09.599
no this is Paul and cian and Jesus this is the performance of

00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:15.520
classical religion cyprian is right cyprian is is

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:21.119
deep in the magic as anyone else maybe that's why they say he had

00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:28.640
serpent Venom coming out of his backside yeah he did up they caught him

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:33.280
in a graveyard with two

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:41.839
prostitutes why why do you need the sex it's part of the right bro there's a

00:47:41.839 --> 00:47:49.160
reason Jesus Christ was arrested with a naked kid in a public park what happened next the person who is in the right

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:57.040
ascends up to the pleades and they glided by under me like a ship right I learned The Whispers of

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:04.359
the stars of course you did there's nothing more oric than that I took possession of the treasuries

00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:11.240
of the Winds do you know what the oldest hymns are in the mystery the Western

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:17.839
mystery The Mystery of the Bronze Age that gave you Judaism and Christianity

00:48:17.839 --> 00:48:25.640
along with hundreds of other Cults do you want to know what happened

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:30.920

giving of drugs yes did you know you can give

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:19.119

attracted to you wow that's fantastic let's give me

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:30.200

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:52.559
activity he's Jehovah let it sink in let it sink in

00:49:52.559 --> 00:49:59.880
what's the stuff they told us it doesn't seem correct that well that's what happens when you allow monest to control

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:08.520
your education you get a fairy tale world you get Disneyland oh my God what's gonna happen

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:14.880
um he's going to lead them look he says I can't brag but you know I got a lot to say about these visions and these

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:22.760
apocalypses that I'm being given by God the Lord wait Paul is having visions yes I

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:28.640
just want you to look at that second line that in Greek opas

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:35.359
opas what is that that is a word that is the closest word to Hallucination is you

00:50:35.359 --> 00:50:41.480
and I understand it in the Greek mind it was a vision or an appearance of someone

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:49.040
that was not actually there it's only seen by the from the perspective of the of the one who's describing it it's the

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:54.559
closest thing we've got to hallucination and then Revelations those apocalypses

00:50:54.559 --> 00:50:59.920
that Paul is going through that is a prophetic IC marking of time right

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:05.480
that's an oracular gift so he's getting these hallucinations and these

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:13.040
comprehensions of time give me the next one boom and what else is happening look

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:19.599
these These are Paul Paul's words I want everybody to Envision for one moment Paul the

00:51:19.599 --> 00:51:27.559
Apostle by the way if you did not realize yet I'll throw this in there as a curve ball because I don't think many

00:51:27.559 --> 00:51:33.160
people have realized this I don't spend a ton of time with

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:43.160
Paul besides reading him frequently and he is uh obsessed with

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:49.119
children he likes to go with the young ons they like to take them on their missionary

00:51:49.119 --> 00:51:57.520
Journeys well there's nothing I can assure you that is not regular that he is

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:04.480
involved with yeah okay let's see the let's see the next one boom give it to

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.559
me you know what's funny is the an Evangelical can't argue around any of

00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:19.040
this because it's just what the text is saying here's what Paul says he says I knew I knew I recognized a dude this

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:24.640
dude he was this kind of dude and what did he do he says I don't know if it was

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:29.880
outside of my body right I don't know if it was in my body

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:35.359
the only one who knows is God but I knew this dude give me the

00:52:35.359 --> 00:52:40.680
next one what do you mean you knew him what do you mean were you familiar with

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:51.359
him well let me explain says Paul let me explain I was grabbed up and jammed into

00:52:51.359 --> 00:52:57.000
paradise and I heard things that are unspoken I heard those

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:03.359
I heard those things that you shall not speak yeah

00:53:03.359 --> 00:53:09.359

you think to yourself those dirty

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:39.160
hippies it looks like the hippies are drawing on some

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:44.359
kind of quantum reality that joins the action of

00:56:44.359 --> 00:56:51.000
whatever the drugs you're doing to your brain with the sex huh interesting is that why when you

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:56.799
enter the right and they put you into the death state with an with with in a state of arousal

00:56:56.799 --> 00:57:02.880
that they will force you into coming to climax while you're

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:08.400
dying that must be quite a that must be quite a thing to undergo it's no wonder

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:13.799

held by Lady Babylon yeah go for it next one let's

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:35.359
get the good let's get to the goodies get the give me the next one look at what is osis that Paul is undergoing

00:57:35.359 --> 00:57:42.359
it's a weakness or a faintness right when his love magic is

00:57:42.359 --> 00:57:51.440
strong enough for Paul Paul will be in a state of complete weakness inability you don't

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:58.799
know the right you've never been to the third heaven and you've entered that

00:57:58.799 --> 00:58:06.160
osis give me the next one just in case you just in case you doubt um look at

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:11.599
atinos right it's just another it's an adjectival form right and it means

00:58:11.599 --> 00:58:20.440
weekly and look what what's right next to that okay ready I'm gonna I'm gonna pop that that false reality in your

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:28.119
brain what is it to mean to be in that Weekly state it means to be pon

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:34.440
unless you come to me Pon you have no place in the Kingdom of

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:40.760
Heaven you won't make it you won't make it the right

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:48.480
requires and that's why Jesus has to be the way he is he's got to hide what's

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:53.559
going on because these are all the rights of the

00:58:53.559 --> 00:59:00.079
initiates these are the mystery rights these are those baptisms that we hear so

00:59:00.079 --> 00:59:06.119
much about you mean baptism is sexual yeah and it involve some

00:59:06.119 --> 00:59:13.200
D yeah good good good good hit me with the next one boom and finally atinos

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:19.839
look you can even and surprise surprise the septu is the source here you can

00:59:19.839 --> 00:59:26.079
even be in that state of weak mindedness think about that for a minute

00:59:26.079 --> 00:59:34.119
you're going to combine that athenia and we use this word today in medicine my athenia gravis right same

00:59:34.119 --> 00:59:40.119
thing um same rot you can be a weakened Soul think about that for a minute what

00:59:40.119 --> 00:59:45.480
does that mean to have your soul weak have your soul weak you have to

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:51.520
enter in to this position of death you have to enter into it's part of the if

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:56.880
you don't have death you don't have Resurrection right is that person aroused yeah that person's brows give me

00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:03.440
the next one boom now I want to read this passage to

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:10.319
you and I know people look at this and they're like holy crap it's an hour we're an hour into this he's got a gigantic passage yet but this is going

01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:16.559
to go fast I'm just going to read it too fast and show you a couple of things now Paul says it was in there somewhere I

01:00:16.559 --> 01:00:23.400
think I may have skipped it but Paul says hey um this is how I got to that third heaven right he doesn't know if it

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:29.760
was in in body or out of body right have you ever had one of those experiences where you're like oh God did that really

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:35.640
happen right and you're not just intellectually questioning it but you

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:40.760
actually kind of foggy about you know what I mean that's part of the

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:46.559
experience Paul is suffering the same side effects right the same mental Haze

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:53.960
they describe it as the mental fog yeah he's got it so that is one

01:00:53.960 --> 01:01:02.599
right which in which involves you and God one onone in a homosexual

01:01:02.599 --> 01:01:10.480
relationship in a place that will take you thanks to that htis will take you all the way to that

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:17.760
Visionary third heaven if you want to go there you're gonna have to do certain things cyprian

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:23.440
is gonna get caught in the cemetery with snake venom coming out of his

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:29.839
butt right certain sacrifices you got to make if you want that Vision all right

01:01:29.839 --> 01:01:36.119
good you know it's the one thing Paul said that he had right everything else was everything else was fine he had some

01:01:36.119 --> 01:01:42.640
trouble rationalizing it that's all let me give you this this is about Phineas this is about Phineas and I just

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:49.160
want to read here from the top um and he reverenced not a wit even Zeus himself

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:55.599
for he for told unerringly oh um Phineas is a prophet he's one of these drug using prophets and we're about to see

01:01:55.599 --> 01:02:02.039
him doing his drug using thing um for he foretold unerringly to men his sacred

01:02:02.039 --> 01:02:10.039
will right he exposed Zeus all the time wherefore Zeus sent upon him a lingering old age and took from his eyes the

01:02:10.039 --> 01:02:15.319
pleasant light he took from his eyes the light

01:02:15.319 --> 01:02:21.559
and suffered him not to have joy of the dainties untold that the Dwellers around

01:02:21.559 --> 01:02:26.880
ever brought to his house when they came to inquire the will of Heaven you want

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:32.760
to go find out what the future is hang out with Phineas and bring him

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:39.640
some lovelies what happened right what

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:46.599
happened uh he had his light taken out of his eyes now this is very very common you might think oh this was the one

01:02:46.599 --> 01:02:52.520
punishment of Zeus on this guy Phineas no no no no no no the sear are always

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:58.559
blind and haven't you noticed that the seers are always blind and the better

01:02:58.559 --> 01:03:06.240
their sight the better their sight the less their Vision the ones who are strongest

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:13.079
in Vision are totally blind why because when you use the

01:03:13.079 --> 01:03:21.680
burning purple it blinds you it's a sacrifice you make in order to see the

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:27.680
reality you have to destroy your own eyes if your

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:34.920
eyes are full of light oh God oh God you mean these

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:41.200
wackos are these wackos are doing this no wonder no wonder he needs

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:47.720
glasses what happened he's um on a sudden swooping through the clouds

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:53.640
whenever he was at his Banquets getting high and talking about the future the harpies with their crooked beaks

01:03:53.640 --> 01:04:00.279
incessantly snatch the food away from his mouth and hands and at times not a

01:04:00.279 --> 01:04:07.200
morsel of food was left at others but a little in order that they might live and be tormented and they poured forth

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:12.799
overall a loathsome stench do you know what happens when you

01:04:12.799 --> 01:04:20.640
mix these drugs with the foods that you're taking you lose the flavor of

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:25.880
life and he's stuck he's stuck why are these harpies doing this and who are the

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:34.119
harpies you know who a harpy is do you have a picture of a harpy chewy probably not give me um who knows um the harpies

01:04:34.119 --> 01:04:43.440

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:49.760
body now if you've never had a woman rip a rip your soul from your body I'm sorry

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.720
no vision for you don't worry about it you don't need to have the concerns that

01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:02.319
Zeus is going to want to bash you because you know the future yeah you don't want to but that's

01:05:02.319 --> 01:05:08.920
okay that's okay if you haven't had the harpies you haven't had the harpies um let's let's keep oh no you didn't find

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:14.119

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:19.279
you know they swoop down right and the harpies they give you the you know remember we're seeing these

01:05:19.279 --> 01:05:25.440

01:06:40.039 --> 01:06:46.039
left and they poured forth this loath some stench and no one dared not merely to carry the food to the mouth but even

01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:51.960
to stand at a distance so fouly wre the remnants of the meal but straight away

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:57.680
when he heard the voice wait wait what and the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of the band he knew that

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.760
they were the men passing by at whose coming Zeus's Oracle had declared to him

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:07.960
that she he should have joy of his food so he rose up from his couch like a like

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:15.000
a light how did he get up right remember remember Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane this the same this is the

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:22.720

with weakness and age and his part skin was caked with dirt and not but the

01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:01.920
skill held his bones together and he came forth from the hall with weared knees and he sat on the threshold of of

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:11.319

01:15:31.719 --> 01:15:39.280
and I want to make a couple of announcement there announcements there are groups that are on Discord groups of

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:45.400
my former students who have gone through the Intensive course and they are

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:51.760
setting up AIDS they're very much like AIDS stations um where you can be helped

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:58.920
whether it's with the alphabet whether it's with vocabulary whether it's with the pronunciation that we insist on at

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:04.520
am andu whether it's those things they're helping you through those things and I know a lot of people have

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:10.360
commented on how helpful it is to my former students like Nancy and Al booy

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:15.440
who are working on those on helping people to be able to make it through the

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:21.719
obstacle courses that we have to run now where are you you are done with unit one

01:16:21.719 --> 01:16:29.560
you read through the introduction you read through unit one you did the exercises in unit one and you were able

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:36.159
to say okay what I can do at this point I can recognize basic words and I can

01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:42.679
work with nouns a little bit I can work with nouns good we did nouns fantastic

01:16:42.679 --> 01:16:49.480
what is coming up over the next two weeks what you will be expected to do is

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:55.520
to read unit two you will read it not just once read it a couple of times read

01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:01.440
through it and go to the vocabulary list what do you do just read it all you're

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:09.000
doing is exposing your brain to the Greek right now don't sit there and try

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:16.520
don't sit there and try let it come natural let mother GRE come to you let

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:24.000
her embrace you right that's how it works go to it and look at the beauty

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.280
look at the beauty beauty of the words look at the sexiness of that vocabulary

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:35.080
list and everything that it tells you about your terrible terrible language

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:40.400
Anglo-Saxon if that's what you're speaking Yeah okay so here's what I need

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:46.000
for you to do unit two is the first of a

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:52.199
two unit section on verbs what are verbs

01:17:52.199 --> 01:17:56.840
what are verbs this is all you need to know

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:08.800
there we go we're back verbs are words of action or being and by the way those

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:14.360
of you look it's the internet okay it kind of makes it quirky you love it I

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:22.080
know you do if you love the fact that it looks like I'm using a camera that's 100 years old um please say that right um

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:27.639
but it's the it's the way it is so look what do you have to do you have to be

01:18:27.639 --> 01:18:34.080
able to recognize what a verb is and what is a verb a verb is an action or a

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:40.280
state of being that's all I want you to think an action or a state of being and

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:49.440
this chapter chapter two we're going to learn the basic components of the verb

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:55.199
how do we describe verbs verbs can be described

01:18:55.199 --> 01:19:02.960
by words like person number tense mood and voice

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:08.440
person number tense mood and voice now do you have to be thinking about this no

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:16.040
and I don't want you to be thinking but if I thought about this stuff I would have never made it through Greek first semester never okay do I want you to be

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:22.480
thinking about it absolutely not I want you to be able to tell me you can describe verbs by their person number

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:28.360
tense mood and voice what is their person first second or third shut up

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:33.400
that's all you need to know what is their number singular or

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:38.800
plural what are their tenses we're about to teach you tenses

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:48.360
and you're going to say past present and future shut up what are the tenses that you need to know present imperfect

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:55.199
future arist perfect and pl perfect there were six of those

01:19:55.199 --> 01:20:03.520
that you will know by the end of unit three present imperfect future aist

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:10.760
perfect PL perfect what are those the present I do

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:17.920
the imperfect I was doing the future I will do the perfect I have done the pl

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:23.840
perfect I had done the aist I did

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:29.719
fantastic okay that's all you need to know for tenses those all you need to recognize

01:20:29.719 --> 01:20:36.920
are those six names and how to translate them and the book will tell you how to translate each

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:43.440
one of those so that's tense what is mood right now you only need to know one

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:48.719
mood and that's called the indicative all verbs have an indicative mood and

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:53.960
it's the majority of the ways that the verb is used you're just indicating

01:20:53.960 --> 01:21:02.639
something okay that's all you need to know for now indicative right what about um voice

01:21:02.639 --> 01:21:08.560
there are three voices we're only going to know one for now it's called the active voice but we also learn the

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:14.880
future the middle and the passive there is no true middle voice in

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:23.080
English why is that because English unlike ancient Greek does not focus on

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:29.400
the perspective of the speaker the Greeks are overly obsessed with the

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:35.080
speaker the one who is performing the action or having the action performed on

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:41.800
it that individual they're obsessed with it's like they can't you can't stop put

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:48.400
put yourselves in the place of the speaker right I wonder if is that a mark of intelligent language I think it is

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:56.560
did you know there are some intelligent languages and there are some dummy languages right people are gonna be like oh no you can't say that yeah you're

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:01.600
saying that because you speak one of those dummy languages fantastic right

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:08.360
know who you are right know who you are hit uh wait oh um so those are what you

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:13.440
need to know from the verb person number 10 smood and voice and you're going to

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:18.760
get all of the examples first person singular I second person singular you

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:24.280
third person singular he she it first person plural we second person

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:29.600
plural plural you third person plural they that's all in the book and it'll

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:36.239
all it'll lay that out for you why because what we're going to do and here's where you need to focus what

01:22:36.239 --> 01:22:43.760
we're going to do when we learn verbs is we're going to understand as a

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:51.760
group that a verb is a machine and it can do many different

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:58.520
things and all you got to do is you got to change it ending maybe put something on the

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:05.159
beginning okay think about that we're going to take an action like kicking and we're gonna say ah I don't want to say

01:23:05.159 --> 01:23:11.840
I'm kicking now I want to say I kicked yesterday you change the ending a little bit slap something on the beginning and

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:19.199
you got I kicked instead of I am kicking right well what if I want to put it in the future you change the ending and you

01:23:19.199 --> 01:23:27.159
make it a future ending so that people can see oh this is kicking in the future right what if I want him to kick what if

01:23:27.159 --> 01:23:34.520
I want our entire group to kick why can't we kick well it's easy change the

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:41.639
ending everything with the verb is dialed in from the ending yeah and so what you're going to

01:23:41.639 --> 01:23:48.280
do that's called conjugation when you take that ending and you put it together with that root

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:53.600
oh God what do you happen you conjugate let's conjugate don't you love

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:59.440
to conjugate we're going to be doing that with our verbs and our verbs the last thing I

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:06.920
want to get across to you tonight because I know you're just going to be starting to read unit two the last thing I want to get across to you

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:14.880
is there is a Savvy way that the verbs have of acting

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:22.639
they can slide in and out of tenses very easily right there's a there's a lot of

01:24:22.639 --> 01:24:29.639
wiggle room and the reason the Greek is that way is because when you hear that entire word and you hear it with its

01:24:29.639 --> 01:24:36.400
beginning and its root and its ending you're forming a mental picture in your

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:42.600
mind and you can wiggle that you can you can paint you can change the tone of

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:47.800
your colors oh god let's make this one more intense right take it from the

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:52.840
indicative mood to the subjunctive and what do we do when we switch from the indicative to the

01:24:52.840 --> 01:25:00.639
subjunctive we go from a world of just plain old narration to a world of

01:25:01.199 --> 01:25:06.880
possibilities yeah in English we just use little models for that it's almost

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:12.159
like we tapped our brains somewhere and now we're going to just marching

01:25:12.159 --> 01:25:17.840
Pete yeah where's the Pete pass the Pete it's on your

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:24.400
feet it's not so sweet give me the next one um I want to go to oh you're saying

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:31.280
where where we going here I want to bring oh I didn't bring it what I need to give you finally is to say hey the

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:36.440
exercises are there when you finish reading each unit you should attempt the

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:42.560
exercises right you should attempt the exercises and I will bring next week the

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:49.360
exercises just a smattering maybe half a dozen maybe 10 of those exercises and we

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:57.119
will go over them now if you can keep up with me you're doing exactly what you should be doing you're keeping up with

01:25:57.119 --> 01:26:04.920
me you're going to notice now in unit two that there are a series of charts in

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:13.840
bold right the present tense the imperfect tense the future

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:19.440
tense you're going to get those now and you're going to see the endings that you got to tack on to those and what are you

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:24.639
going to do with those endings you're going to memorize them you're going to

01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:31.600
memorize them what are the presents OA Omi what are the Imperfects

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:38.360
on on what are the erist

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:44.119
on interesting you mean you can just wrote those things yeah I need you to do

01:26:44.119 --> 01:26:50.159
that part of the Intensive course is teaching you to go through those charts

01:26:50.159 --> 01:26:57.600
and just boom memorize them so you can spit them out memorize your endings in in Victorian

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:03.600
England when you get the whip to smash the little boys on their backsides for

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:10.920
not learning the their Greek paradigms properly you say what are your

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:21.080
endings now you have to do that at this point because this is basic training when you're translating in the future

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:28.480
you're not going to be thinking oh God wait wait a I'm oh this is right you're not going to be thinking that way as the

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:35.800
more you progress into ancient Greek the less you're going to see um that that uh

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:42.000
tuning you're just going to see the final product and it's going to click it's like riding a wave you get to a

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:50.719
point where you're just riding a wave but at this point in the game if you don't and I lose I lose people's

01:27:50.719 --> 01:27:58.080
interest if I focus on the paradigms too much because it's a lot of work it's a

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:03.360
lot of building it's a lot of of weightlifting just constant

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:10.480
weightlifting so here's what I need for you to do for those of you are following I'm going use intensive Greek course I

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:15.719
need you to memorize all the tense endings for the

01:28:15.719 --> 01:28:21.400
verbs from unit two for next week so I can shout out and I can say what are the

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:28.320
future endings and you say O say U we're going to start doing that next week what

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.920
are you going to be doing this week grade unit two comprehend it start
