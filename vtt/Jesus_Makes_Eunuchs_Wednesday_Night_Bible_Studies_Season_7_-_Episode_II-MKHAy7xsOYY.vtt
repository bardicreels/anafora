Mysteries are doing these are the Bic women I want you to I want to point it

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:53.440
out to you this is an ancient priest helenistic priest named nander and he is

00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:02.199
talking about the bucket choruses what they do okay they enter into states of mania

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:09.199
via drugs now this may have been this may have been something that the

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:16.199
philologists classical philologist stood around and had to catch themselves because they don't believe in drugs they

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:21.240
don't believe that we should talk about the founders of democracy using drugs we

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:26.680
shouldn't we shouldn't unless they did in which case we have to talk about it

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:32.800
that's what I'm bringing you let's get the next source there we are with these bachans here's another source of bachans

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.240

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:45.000

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:59.560
here toor unknown languages o and what else they going to

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.600
be doing they're going to be raising up handling

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:10.079
serpents seriously these guys you know these bonings are nuts man you ever seen

00:09:10.079 --> 00:09:17.600
the ancient Greco Roman portrayals of them they're running up and down Hills with snakes they got snakes around their

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:24.440

vipers what are they doing they got a basket full of them why do you have to

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:36.839
ladies if you're going on a picnic for the weekend I understand the different

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:44.160
supplies that you're going to take I don't get the basket full of snakes unless you're using that Venom I

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.480
don't get it is does this all make sense of course

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:57.640
the system mystica that sacred Arc has within it that source of the

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:03.120
Venom that you need need to get high so that you can do things like these people

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.200
are doing what else do these people do they're going to come up with these new languages they're going to be handling

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:16.600
the snakes and what's gonna this is a nice conditional here if somebody you know drinking the

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:22.399
thimon you're drinking that death dealing Brew you're getting into that

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:27.519

something get in the throne W okay um let's go back to that one one more time

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.600
I just want to finish it off so if they drink you know when they go into these

00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:00.360
rights and they're entering into the death State nothing's going to hurt them right this it's not going to hurt him

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.680
and he he even uses an expression here that's a an affirmative it's an

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:13.440
effective affirmative where you it's it's emphasizing no no way no way will

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.320
anything injure them right and what do these freaks do what do these death cult

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:25.000
freaks do they remember okay wait hang on don't remember yet remember in a

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.600
minute what do they do they put their hands they put their hands on these

uninspired they get feely touchy feely putting their hands on the uninspired

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:46.000

00:53:06.079 --> 00:53:13.280
the um disciples the maai the students of Jesus these teenage boys that he's

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:19.240
with continuously and they're naked at some points when he's on the boat with them um when they're on the boat with

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:25.520
each other than n they're naked when they're in the upper room he's naked with them and he's using his is

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:34.400
underwear to dry their feet which nobody ever seems to find weird um but okay okay um I've seen a

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:41.960
lot of cult stuff um you know it's the The Germ phobia right in me that makes

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:48.319
me think why would you dry a 12-year-old boy's feet that you've just washed and

00:53:48.319 --> 00:53:54.160
handled why would you dry that with the thing that's wrapped around your private

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:59.839
parts it seems odd doesn't it I mean if somebody did that a daycare I'd say

00:53:59.839 --> 00:54:05.000
whatat are you doing right but Jesus Jesus gets away

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:12.119
with it and he's gonna scandalize himself are you ready we're gonna look at Jesus touching children I want you to

00:54:12.119 --> 00:54:18.720
see it for the first time because yes it it is what it sounds like okay bring us

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:24.000

aggressively conquer with the hands um induce SE sexual urges with to

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:57.920
awaken and are enliven with the hands to grasp to grasp he's getting handsy this

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:03.960
is what they want him to do and we'll see what this what this means cult wise in a second it says it and the what what

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:10.599
do his disciples what do the apostles say um they were they they um gave him a

00:55:10.599 --> 00:55:17.200
hard time about it yeah they called him short on it and when he saw them doing

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:23.039
this he got pissed this says Jesus got pissed yes verse

00:55:23.039 --> 00:55:28.720

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:59.480
all of a sudden all the demons per up right it's only when he's doing serious stuff that he does this right stuff

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:05.520
that's out of the PGM they use it too right um so he says

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:13.440

00:58:28.039 --> 00:58:33.440
what Jesus does when he touches children you don't see him doing this

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:40.039
with Roman centurions I'll guarantee you that when he puts his hands on them he

00:58:40.039 --> 00:58:45.799
Praises them he eulogizes what he is

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:56.720
touching full body contact infolding that child pray raing them do you know

00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:02.839
why he's going to need those children later when he gets arrested in the public parking for him with one of them

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:11.240
naked with a bandage on their private parts okay just wait just wait for those

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:05.920
people are bringing them the children in order that he might put his hands on them and what else is he doing the only

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:12.480
reason I bring this up because it's almost word for word exactly what the mark passage is um but the reason I

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:18.799
bring it up is is he adds a different detail he says he is pro El he's

01:00:18.799 --> 01:00:25.599
entering a state of prayer he's entering these prayers wait a minute

01:00:25.599 --> 01:00:31.039
you mean in our cult when we pray turn it take it down when we pray this freak

01:00:31.039 --> 01:00:36.559
of an Angel takes this insense boom and I'm fumigating you

01:00:36.559 --> 01:00:42.920
people yeah why for our prayers baby that's the only way you talk to God you

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:50.240
think you talk to God children children you think you talk to God sitting in your bed do you get out of your bed at

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:56.799
night do you get out of your bed at night kids and sit on the side of your bed and fold your hands and pray to

01:00:56.799 --> 01:01:01.880
Sweet Jesus you are not

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:09.319
Christians that is not how it was done by Jesus and his peeps that is not how

01:01:09.319 --> 01:01:16.440
it was done that prayer is carried on the back of a psychotropic

01:01:17.039 --> 01:01:22.440
substance do you mean when Jesus gets thrown into the Wilderness do you mean

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:28.119
he that's where he's going to talk to the devil yeah

01:01:28.119 --> 01:01:33.799
yeah right it's your prayers my friend what's Jesus doing with kids is he

01:01:33.799 --> 01:01:40.559
touches them and Praises their parts he is sending up that incense of

01:01:40.559 --> 01:01:46.400
prayer to God and if you don't understand

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:52.240
that it's probably better off for you in the long

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:59.920
run for those of us who want to see what's going on because we're voyers um let's keep looking Jesus I

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:06.720
know it's we're getting here to a terrible you know Jesus Christ Jesus Christ this is getting to a ter yeah

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.000
let's go to it let's go to the next one yeah um and the Pharisees you know what

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.839
I mean here's here's what's setting up is touching of the children now watch The Grooming of the Apostles here the

01:02:18.839 --> 01:02:25.200
Pharisees right they approach him and they're they're going to test him you know and they talk to him about divorce

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:31.559
long story short they talk to him about divorce and is it okay Moses said you can put your you can make a writing

01:02:31.559 --> 01:02:37.039
divorce and Jesus says H you guys are jerks right um don't you know they're

01:02:37.039 --> 01:02:43.319
one you're one flesh with your spouse you're one flesh bro right and you can't

01:02:43.319 --> 01:02:49.520
separate that God has put that together Moses knew you guys were idiots and

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:56.319
that's why he gave you that right to be able to do that right and he finally finishes up

01:02:56.319 --> 01:03:01.440
here in the end he saysi saying to you that whoever is going to put that her

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:07.760
away whoever is going to divorce his wife except for the case of

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:17.000
porna except for the case of pora what is this person he's a

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.640
Moos he's a Moos you know what a Moos was at the time this is not a Jewish

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:30.960
concept yeah this is not okay a Moos is somebody who's G to

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:37.160
freely freely partake in it you know what I mean you can't keep these people

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:44.839
off these people are nymphs right these people are saders they're not g to

01:03:44.839 --> 01:03:50.000
stop so who's Jesus talking to well he's

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:58.440
talking to these Pharisees but his kids his children children are his lamkins are still there

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:04.119
with him and they're listening and it they say that's not right Jesus right

01:04:04.119 --> 01:04:10.039
group of kids says that's not right go go to it next one go to it

01:04:10.039 --> 01:04:15.160
yeah next one yeah and um so this is

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:21.640
when they bring kids to them right and they're saying he's saying allow them to come to me I think I skipped one yeah

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:26.839
and so the students the the you know the Apostles say to them you know if this is

01:04:26.839 --> 01:04:33.599
the case for men with women look if this how it if this is how it is um for men

01:04:33.599 --> 01:04:39.720
and women right now and when I say when you could for men there you could also

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:48.319
say purpose of people you can also say people you know in if this is how it is

01:04:48.319 --> 01:04:55.200
um that we're going to end up dealing with women it's better not to get married right that's I'm going to read

01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:00.480
it to you again just so bring it back up I'm going to read read it to you again

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:06.839
yeah if this is the thing that happens to the

01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:12.960
man with the woman it doesn't help to get married it's not advantageous to get

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:20.039
married and Jesus said oh you're right kitties I didn't mean to say that

01:05:20.039 --> 01:05:27.559
because I'm a follower of doson and focus on the family and I love love love the Evangelical

01:05:27.559 --> 01:05:32.760
support of the family this is Jesus wo no he didn't say that I wasn't

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:41.200
translating I was making that up what does he say in response he doesn't deny it he says to them something that's

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.720
really creepy so he says to them not

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:55.039
everybody not everybody can take in this thing this logos except

01:05:55.039 --> 01:06:03.400

whichever one of you is able to take this on take it

01:06:42.279 --> 01:06:52.160
on okay so did Jesus just groom a bunch of boys to consider becoming

01:06:52.839 --> 01:06:58.680
Unix and and you're sitting there thinking unic unic what what I nobody's

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:06.880
in Antiquity they're cutting off a lot more testicles than you're used to yeah a lot of testicles people

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:13.559
animals it's just the thing it's just the thing do you know the doctors are into it you think you think your

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:38.039
that we have to do that chewy it really gets my goat that we have to do this we

01:07:38.039 --> 01:07:45.599
have to cover up I want people to think of that sign of the cross whenever they're tempted to think

01:07:45.599 --> 01:07:51.359
about the naughty parts even if they're the naughty parts of the goat yeah let's

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:58.480

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:12.319
people okay I'll just say it the same religious groups that

01:08:12.319 --> 01:08:18.679

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:30.040
group does that make sense it makes sense doesn't it it's so inherently

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:35.880
dishonest modern Christianity I'm not talking about what Jesus did I'm not talking about what John the Baptist did

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:43.000
I'm not talking about any of the Apostles I'm talking about modern Christianity modern Christianity is a

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:50.600
lie and it is a lie that forces the person to become a liar it's amazing you

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:56.480

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:17.080
to a kid we know it's not out of Norm out of a normal parameter for what the

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:24.800
mystery religions are doing they're calling their members Pedas John the Baptist is a huge one

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:31.000
he's walking around with a penis shaped cup where do you put

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:41.000
that glass it's essentially a glass phus a glass dildo John the Baptist carried

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.760
around a glass dildo yes that's a fact and that's a

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:53.239
scientific term dildo by the way yes scientific um it's a we have ancient

01:11:53.239 --> 01:11:59.760
dildo those that have been found um you know um really old ones I think

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:05.600

okay I'm riding I'm trying to ride that line I'm trying to write it right carefully this is school children don't

01:12:33.239 --> 01:12:39.360
be surprised if we have to say scientific terms let's go to the Y

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:47.040
they're going to try to get me on that one you watch everybody if this is taken down you'll know why okay you'll know who did it opticos right able to come

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:54.120
into contact look at the just number three of medicines right hoptic Co it's that

01:12:54.120 --> 01:13:02.760
which causes you know the action of the of the of the plant that they're using

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:08.520
right they put it on there and it works as a medicine you could say it works let's go to the next

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:15.560
one here's a whole bunch oh here's a whole bunch of Unix I just thought I'd show you how much the Greeks love this

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:23.719
word unic right you can unze someone um you can have something that's adjectivally unic like right you talk a

01:13:23.719 --> 01:13:31.760
straight up castration straight up castration right love it the Unix very common Antiquity

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.960
and Jesus is encouraging the kids he says right imagine saying to a

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:44.000
10-year-old that's what we need we need to bring Jesus back that's what we need you need to go to Sunday school and you

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.199
need somebody to come in and be Jesus that's what you need and Jesus will

01:13:50.199 --> 01:13:57.960
offer for you kids he'll offer castration if you can take it this is

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:04.440
part of your thing do it that was the advice that was the advice it's very

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:10.520
friendly it's a very friendly kind of advice from Jesus right why is that

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:18.000
because marriage sucks is what he says the kids pick it up and they're

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.639
like if this is what marriage is forget it right forget it it's better not to be

01:14:23.639 --> 01:14:29.000
married and he doesn't refute it he says well you know there's a third option you

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.639
can remove your testicles for the Kingdom of Heaven did you know you could

01:14:34.639 --> 01:14:41.360
cut off your testicles I just want people to see this you can cut off your testicles for the Kingdom of

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:48.280
Heaven even if you're just a kid so the Christians today that are saying

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:55.080
transgender people should not be able to do these things they were the ones doing

01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:02.639
it originally yeah think about that for a minute think of where their mind was

01:15:02.639 --> 01:15:08.800
that was not a problem right for a boy to castrate himself and to take on those

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:16.320
more feminine characteristics that was normal that was the kingdom of heaven right people said does this

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:24.320
religion always go back to the Fran mother yes it does it does

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:31.280
come on Addis now you know what's going on in

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:38.000
Jesus's mind let's just look at a couple of extra sources yep keep going um look at this one people this is one nobody's

to the dressing and then just like those people who make

01:17:01.639 --> 01:17:08.199
Unix they apply a drug which is there for the sake

01:17:08.199 --> 01:17:14.920

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:21.920
only that but there's drugs that we use just for these purposes right just for these

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:28.760
purposes I'm going to bring you the last I want you to um just to kind

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:37.000
of set you up for the climax look this is galen's work on seed right Seaman

speros see the speros at the top this is galen's work

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:49.840
on seed and there's two books of it there's an alpha and a beta and Alpha is

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:56.840
about masculinity beta is about femin femininity and what is really really

01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:05.040
creepy you can take it down what's really kind of fun creepy as you read this he'll talk about things like the

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:11.320
testicles G Will and he'll say this is how you treat the testicles right whatever case that you're trying to do

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:18.120
whatever it's with whether it's castration or not this is how you do it he says you know the um testicles of the

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:24.440
woman and then he describes in detail where the ovaries are in absolute

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:29.639
perfect detail as if he were in his surgeries

01:19:29.639 --> 01:19:36.239
observing these things yeah and this is the connection

01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:43.080
with those manate inducers within the right within the right you have got if

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:51.840
you want to reach the Kingdom of Heaven you have to be in that unic

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:59.320
state you have to be what is it that they're doing for these Unix gayen will tell you straight up this is how it

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:04.719
changes the person right this is how it changes the person this is how they're

01:20:04.719 --> 01:20:10.320
able to interact with drugs right these Cults are using drugs

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:17.560
on people that they've castrated because the castrated boys become the oracles

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:24.480
when you don't have those androgens you get that typically Fe emale response

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:30.120
from the compound drugs this is why Jesus Christ was

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:38.880
arrested in a public park with a naked boy who had a bandage the text tells us

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:47.400
epu on his private parts yeah we've been watching a

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:53.560
cult for the last 2,000 years we've been watching a cult

01:20:53.560 --> 01:21:00.560

01:22:07.239 --> 01:22:14.040
magic right there's something in US consuming that

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:21.280
Essence is what kicks us into the mystery do you know why the word pora is

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:27.880
both fornication and idolatry because you cannot perform the Christian mystery
