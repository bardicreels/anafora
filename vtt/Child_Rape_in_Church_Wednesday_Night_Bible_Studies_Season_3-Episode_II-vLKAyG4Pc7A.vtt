00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.050
[Applause] [Music] [Applause]

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.399
[Music] welcome back to the lady Babylon thanks

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.340
for showing up I want to let you know that tonight we have the most excellent

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.820
we have the most excellent Clips I managed to get an interview with

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.940
Anastasia from Ukraine um she's been featured on Gnostic

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.680
informant and tonight I'll have a few Clips I'll be using the interview that I did with her over the next couple of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.200
weeks running little clips for you and uh it's a real pleasure and an honor to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.780
be able to talk to her I came away from our conversation today uh with real

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.360
humility and a sense of Honor that I think will impact you as well

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.360
um thank you for that Anastasia thank you um tonight we're going to start off with

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:43.799
those interviews and then we're going to move into a very dark and difficult topic and that is the child rape ritual

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.900
of the early Christian Church

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.149
[Music]

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.299
thank you

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.580
so let's roll that first clip and what I want you to appreciate is the fact that

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.180
I am not in it that is her answers and her voice

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.560
you made up it's possible and um yeah and just understand that there

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.819
are more important things than trust your life and I guess in the age of like very

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.739
individualistic kind of like approach to life it's something not very common but

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.040
in times like this you have to I guess you have a change of a perspective is the best way to put it you don't see

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.500
yourself as such an important thing anymore you see the you know values such

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.860
as Freedom you talked about and you know all of that is more important and I

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.140
wanna do anything I can to you know to achieve that dream

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.800
that dream of I guess Ukraine of Freedom Independence and dignity and generations

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.440
of people in Ukraine before me died for that so they were killed either by

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.480
Soviet Russian you know Soviet Russians or Russian Empire or whatever the the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.599
hell else and I don't think I'm any like better than them on my life is more

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:35.700
valuable than theirs because they sacrifice their lives to achieve this and I think it's quite Fair

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.640
so you can see right away everyone gets excited because what more could we ask

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:50.400
of the Divine Athena that Divine spirit that guards our democracy

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.420
um that freedom from oppression um as the more I talk to

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:04.440
Anastasia the more I by the way her name is Greek and it means to rise again

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.939
or to rise from from having fallen and I think it's a fantastic

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:21.239
metaphor for her what she's doing um her fault remember her father was killed in a missile strike uh

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:28.380
and she was telling me about the activities that she does I don't want to give too much away but

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.660
Anastasia has more courage than I've seen

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.250
than I've seen in my entire 52 years on this planet so

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.620
[Music] um let me just stand in amazement at the idea that there could be

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.500
something bigger than your life as an American I find that hard to believe

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.780
I find it hard to believe that there's anything more important than me

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:05.340
but here is this made of harkiv who is telling me that the war brought

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.820
her to a place and her Revolution brought her to a place

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.139
that she understood there's something bigger

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.380
it's only on the field of Mars it's only in the Grove of Mars that the sacred

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.860
song of the Virgin is preserved there are certain places in time where

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.419
the spirit is able to indwell incarnate flesh and what you're

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:43.919
seeing before you is one of those incarnated yes by the way Anastasia is of Greek

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:50.880
extraction but she also has connections to Georgia um I know I didn't want to tell her that

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.919
she her bravery we talked about her bravery and courage she's very humble

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.979
and doesn't want to admit it and then she says something that illustrates

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:07.320
extreme courage and dedication yeah fearlessness

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.020
so let's run the second clip go ahead my father would not leave I asked him a

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.240
couple times you know he wouldn't leave and that was his choice and I respect

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:26.940
that still despite the fact that he is dead and I would prefer him to live obviously but um yeah but I think it was

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.340
his choice to stay and I respect that because you know I cannot begrudge them

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:39.419
that much him that much I stayed you know I go to the front lines and risk myself so why would I ask other people

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:46.680
to you know to go to safety then when I don't do it you know I guess hyped us and encourage us to continue what we're

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:53.880
doing because I don't want them to die for nothing and they would not want to die for nothing so we should honor them

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.900
and their sacrifice and their their untimely uh murder I guess is the word I

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.840
would say for that and um to fight for them as well and to they would say a

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.419
fast should continue and we should honor the you know the losses and struggle on

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:18.380
I guess because uh nothing would make me I guess you could say more sad than

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:24.000
knowing that my father was killed for nothing you know I I wanted to be for

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.419
something right so and that's something should be a victory

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:36.180
and you see how She carries the voice of Her ancestors

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:42.180
the dead She carries the voice of her father and gives the gives a place for

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:48.479
that voice in this world um it's absolutely

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:56.099
under the most dire circumstances forging of that psychic Diamond that historical

00:07:56.099 --> 00:08:03.479
diamond and it's amazing to watch and it's humbling and you can see by her speech alone

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:10.680
there's a sacred nature to what is how she meant she talks about sacrifice and

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:17.580
it's incredible you know I listened to professors for years talk about sacrifice sacrifice all sorts of

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:25.199
sacrifices not once that I ever understand what that sacrifice meant

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:32.339
until I talked to Anastasia I've got one more clip and I want you to

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:40.140
I want you to reflect on a minute yourself look at yourself through her it made me feel good because it made me

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:46.320
feel like there was some kind of hope there was some kind of hope and some kind of Beauty in the world

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.420
um go ahead I think people have shown I guess

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:58.560
Ukraine in general I like worked with couple like YouTubers journalists who came to Ukraine and they

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.320
were very I guess you could say impressed with the the way ukrainians handle things the way they talk and

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:11.640
stuff like that and I think like the way you say the beauty like of it I guess it does show like what it will you know the

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:17.940
I don't want to like to be like very I don't know like pretentious I guess it's

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:25.140
a word but uh but it's not about like that it's about when you like hear people and what they say it just comes

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:30.420
off as very like beautiful in this ugliness of War of like invasion of

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:36.600
Terror of torture of everything that Russia brought to us you know and uh

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:42.779
despite that people still smile people still care for each other people are uh

00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:48.060
you know standing with each other and they are caring for animals for children

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:55.680
for elderly and people do try to uh you know to remain uh as human as possible

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:03.959
this is something I personally really care about because I don't want this ugliness to to stain us I guess

00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:10.620
she doesn't want the ugliness to stain them she also talks about the struggles right

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:16.440
the change and the mental attitude and under the rigors of war and death and

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:25.620
watching death the fear the anxiety of being you know uh blown up Suddenly

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:31.140
um she talks about the future I had to ask her you know I did I had to present

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:36.360
her as the Oracle and I had to reach in she doesn't know that she's got that

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:42.600
scythian Amazonian Queen someday she'll be in her inner blood someday she'll be

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:49.680
the president of Ukraine and you and Iowa you and I will say yes yes we know

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:57.720

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:03.959
like Athens these are the types that create for us the freedoms that you and

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:12.300
I have been sitting around all our lifetimes enjoying um yeah yeah they're the ones who who

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:19.920
enter into that place that sacred place where the price is paid and the sacrifice is made as we're talking about

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.940
the operation of the mystery and tonight I'm going to talk about the mystery as it operated in early Christianity

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:32.640
as as we talk about that you think oh this is just textbook stuff it's just

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:38.640

00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:20.040
Hillman seated in front of an ecstatic follower of Dionysus I see that I see that this

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.800
drunken Sater promote weight who's the drunken Seder the strong consider promotes the

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:32.339
conception of the gauze that provokes a viscerally negative response from Christian culture

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:41.100
it's true it's true he promotes a visceral response when he

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:46.620
had hair and when he doesn't he promotes a visceral response the Slater does

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:53.040
I can honestly tell you that I have been kicked out of

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.480
more institutions schools and poetry

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.060
um groups my poems weren't that bad it was just it

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:12.300
was the wrong audience I gave it I gave a rating about the Black Version who

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.760
we'll get to the black virgin title use of Medea I gave a reading and

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:24.480
got kicked out can you believe that I kicked out of a poetry group was populated by

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:30.180
60 to 80 year old Midwestern women and they didn't like it they didn't like my

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:37.260
poetry but that doesn't matter I'm gonna read you a book the first chapter of

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:45.420
um original sin original sin original sin so let's start exclusive sodomy is

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:52.079
the name at the heading the sodomizing of young children by the Christian clergy is a

00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:58.500
practice as old as a Catholic Church itself most people today believe that the gruesome activities of priest

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:04.500
pedophiles are an unfortunate reality of a religious hierarchy that promotes

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:10.740
celibacy and deters its priests from experiencing any form of sexual pleasure

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:17.579
however child however child abuse in the church is profoundly institutional

00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:24.660
and by the way I just want to pipe in I wrote this my editor is a Pulitzer Prize

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.880
winner okay everything that we every assertion

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:35.760
that I make I make from evidence textual evidence that's what I work with and

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:42.000
I'll sprinkle these texts within our readings but I want you to know that when I make a statement like that I'm

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.639
doing so based upon actual texts okay

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:53.399
child abuse is Not an Accident of church history it is an integral Foundation

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:59.100
component of Christianity ritual child right performed by

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:06.660
Christian priests was very much the result of a cultural War declared by religious zealots during the

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:13.199
first few centuries of the church the earliest Generations that followed the birth and death of Jesus witnessed

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:21.418
incredible social upheaval on an unparalleled scale Europe North Africa and parts of Asia

00:17:21.419 --> 00:17:26.760
all inextricably knotted up in the Affairs of the political Behemoth called

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:33.240
the Roman Empire the unity that so characterized the Roman World facilitated a head-to-head

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:39.900
social conflict of Christians and non-christians and for those of you who have heard the

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:45.299
term cultural War yes it's the same people it's the same

00:17:45.299 --> 00:17:52.620
people with the signs that say save the children who have the blood of Putin on

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:58.559
their hands on their hands I was called up by a relative and at the beginning of

00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:03.900
the invasion and was told hey we shouldn't support the ukrainians because they're all drug

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:10.799
users and LGBT supporters yeah yeah the blood is on your hands

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:16.260
it's on your hands we stand with Anastasia that's what we do

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:23.100
the polytheistic core of classical religion effortlessly adapted itself to

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:28.440
encounters with new divinities from the East but the arrival of proselytizing

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:35.760
Christian monotheists in the Common Era was the beginning of the end for the Roman way of life the Roman Pantheon of

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:41.220
gods despite its inclusive Tendencies quickly succumbed to the demands of the

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:49.320
Christian Priestly hierarchy that flourished on the basis of its pronounced exclusivity

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:55.500
Christian priests did not blend into the classical World they were known for

00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:02.899
their uniqueness and I want people to remember the first Christian priest was Jesus Christ

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:11.340
so the academics who picked their backsides and write Publications and make papers that are absurd and do not

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:17.520
help Society those people will tell you wait the first priest did not come along

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:25.980
I have a degree in religion from Harvard yes and you still don't read the text do

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:31.620
you you still don't read the sources do you yes um even the early church fathers are

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:37.080
taking the names used by the mysticogs on the Pagan side so there is a viable

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:43.320
priesthood and the first Bishops are right after you think Bishops go way back to the beginning

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:49.440
so yeah this is good stuff Christian priests did not blend in the classic the classical world

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:55.140
they were known for their uniqueness common members of the early church were

00:19:55.140 --> 00:20:00.179
secretive and isolated monks were lone intolerant zealots

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:05.280
beyond the reach of custom and law priests refused to swear allegiance to

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:13.260
the emperor common Christians dropped out of society and became highly secretive mystery initiations involving

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:19.320
the rape of children served to reinforce the church's efforts to set its members

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:27.419
apart from the rest of the general population while rigorously promoting the not to be questioned authority of

00:20:27.419 --> 00:20:32.520
the clergy the non-christians who lived during the

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:39.900
rise of the Christian Church claimed they were witnessing the end of civilization So for anybody who tells

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:46.020
you who went for anybody who tells you that Christianity is the hope it's the

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:51.720
Springer of democracy they're lying to you they're lying to you

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:59.160
the world watched its decline with the rise of Christianity let me say

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:06.780
that again the world watched its decline during the rise of Christianity and

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:12.000
wrote about it yeah the Greeks and Romans might have

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.340
invented democracy science and medicine

00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:23.700
but their shared culture eventually resigned itself to defeat in the face of the rapidly expanding power of an

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:29.760
exclusively male priesthood known for its novel views of sex

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:35.039
Roman Educators bureaucrats and politicians slowly ceded their cultural

00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:41.880
Traditions to church Dogma if you have somebody yelling long enough about

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.919
people they don't like in school board meetings and history that they want to

00:21:46.919 --> 00:21:54.539
burn by the way Anastasia said that the um putinites those who were trying to

00:21:54.539 --> 00:22:01.440
stamp out their culture and their language even down to their language that they love burning books

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:08.400
anytime you see historically a group that burns books or bans books because

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.500
that's the same thing um this group is the one that will

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:20.039
eventually try to overthrow the government happens every time every time

00:22:20.039 --> 00:22:25.679
it's a it's a Machinery it's Machinery right information control you guys are

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:31.500
all super intelligent I didn't tell Anastasia how smart my audience is

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.539
um but um you guys this is you already know

00:22:36.539 --> 00:22:41.640
this let's continue on the foundation of classical religion was its enthusiastic

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:49.140
veneration of beauty unlike the rest of the classical world the Christians employ General moral definitions of Good

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:54.840
and Evil that made their followers unique the Greeks and Romans believed

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.780
individual inquiry determined morality but for the Christians living anywhere

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:06.360
in the empire under the auspices of any ethnic group there was one cultural

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:12.179
constant Jesus was the standard of morality not nature

00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:18.539
with a capital N yes Ignatius the bishop of Antioch and

00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:26.280
student of the Apostle John was among the earliest of Christians to establish the concept of get this Orthodox

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.520
language wait a minute what yes yes the same book

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:38.039
burners produce Orthodox language

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:43.559
in doing so he helped to limit any form of criticism of the church a concession

00:23:43.559 --> 00:23:51.440
that non-Christian priests were never granted the term pagan

00:23:52.980 --> 00:24:00.240
as Orthodox speech and Doctrine came to the fore of the ancient stage Christians began calling non-christians

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:07.620
pagans it was a pejorative term like our modern hillbilly or redneck and the Word was

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:14.640
meant to describe anyone who refused to follow the Christian Messiah as the source of universal truth

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:21.900
of course it was arrogantly condescending but it was primarily a means of isolating non-christians as

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:27.780
morally distinct from the growing numbers of Christians right this the p

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:34.620
word is the equivalence of the n-word yeah I've seen it in some texts where it

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:41.520
was just referencing the fact that these were woodsy backwoodsy proceedings yeah

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:47.340
the very heart nature of the religion of the Roman people right from the

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:54.240
countryside yeah but the term is used as the n-word is used

00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:01.799
um in America it is meant to demean in a racial sense to say I am Superior to you

00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:07.140
and of this inclination was born in Christianity

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:14.100
right a desire to take the other and to denigrate to denigrate them yes and this

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:21.419
becomes very very cynically dark because the priests take this mentality and they

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:27.600
funnel it into child abuse yes child abuse

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:33.000
133 000 in Europe's from 1950 I think it was

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.480
yeah as Orthodox speech and Doctrine came to the fore of the ancient stage Christians

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:45.720
we call began calling non-christians pagans it was a pejorative term of course it was arrogantly

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:53.400
condescending in the early centuries of the common Arabs increasingly painted pagans in a negative moral light based

00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:00.539
on their age-old use of drugs and religious ritual surprise surprise as

00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:06.299
you see the the anti-drug movement grow in America in the 1980s where does it

00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:11.940
come from comes from the same place Cleo tells us history tells us things don't

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:18.059
change right not not in 2000 years maybe in two hundred thousand not in

00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:24.960
2000 good the earliest prominent Church fathers worked

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:30.900
diligently to root out the use of drugs in their own meetings you didn't know that did you you didn't know the first

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:36.659
Christians used drugs yes in their own meetings and celebrations

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:43.500
in order to distinguish themselves from Pagan religions steeped in the use of psychotropic drugs the earliest

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:51.900
Christian Eucharist when I found this I was shocked the earliest Christian Eucharist was referred to as quote the

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:58.260
drug of immortality they called their own Eucharist a drug

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:06.299
but Christian priests work diligently to distinguish their own drug use from that of non-christians and isn't it funny you

00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:13.440
find that Christianity is so full of hypocrisy at its root it is hypocritical

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:19.740
yes like my Christian relatives telling me all ukrainians or drug users and

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:24.960
that's why Putin should be able to go in there but you know why they you know why

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:31.500
they say that I mean come here come a little bit closer to me you know why the evangelicals are supporting Putin and

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:37.679
have blood on their hands right now they have a plan he's the Russian Bear who's

00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:42.779
going to come down Gog and Magog this whole thing then Jesus can come and kill

00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:50.840
all of us that's the plan that's the plan when I was in Israel

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:57.480
I discovered right away I lived there for a year and I just do an archaeological stuff and I I discovered

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.520
right away that the common Israeli is secular they

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:09.120
don't give a anything about the religion right they just want to live like the

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.340
rest of us hey yeah

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:20.940
yeah interesting interesting um

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:26.880
in his letter to the Ephesians Ignatius who assumed a title commonly reserved

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:34.380
for important Pagan priests taunted the use of non-Christian drugs was tantamount to the rejection of Orthodoxy

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:41.520
he said therefore emerging you not I but the love of Jesus Christ make use only

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:47.820
of Christian food and abstain from that foreign plan

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:53.100
which is heresy yes yes it's from a drug

00:28:53.100 --> 00:29:01.140
that they're abstaining their drug of immortality is just that right it's a

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:08.880
substance good by the fourth Century thanks to the power of Bishops Roman laws were written

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:18.299
to ban the use of drugs in any sort of cultic practices you see these in libanius under penalty of execution this

00:29:18.299 --> 00:29:24.240
gave the Bishops legal authority to arrest drug using pagans and seize their

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.940
property does that sound new think of a think of a scheme where you

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:36.419
can bust into somebody's property smell some drugs and arrest them and

00:29:36.419 --> 00:29:41.820
take their property and voila now you have a place where your Bishop can have

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:48.120
a second home he can come there and stay there with his uh virgins

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:55.520
yeah fantastic assets from drug seizures were directly

00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:01.799
absorbed by the church the pagans viewed this assimilation of public wealth by

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:07.799
the church as an injustice and evidence of the content of the corrupt motives of

00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:12.980
Christian priests pagans had long

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:23.940
suspected that Christianity was a convenient way to get rich listen to

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:31.559
this the Pagan philosopher poor fiery everybody loves Celsius right but um for

00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:36.659
fiery is fantastic too just quite a thinker in his work against the

00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:43.980
Christians he expressed the common sentiment this way quote The

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:49.380
Words of Christ I came not to bring peace but a sword I came to separate a

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:54.919
son from his father these words belie the true intentions of the Christians

00:30:54.919 --> 00:31:01.320
they seek riches and Glory far from being friends of the Empire their

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:06.659
Renegades waiting for their chance to secure control

00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:12.299
yes waiting for their chance the very first flag when those creeps went in and

00:31:12.299 --> 00:31:18.059
took a dump in our Capital the very first flag that was in was the flag of Jesus

00:31:18.059 --> 00:31:24.899
the very first thing those those traitors did after they pooped

00:31:24.899 --> 00:31:31.500
was they said a prayer said a prayer Chewie what's wrong do you

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:36.899
like the image of the pooping insurrectionists

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:44.039
they had a yeah they ought to give them extra time for just the pooping

00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:50.399
um yeah fantastic the first Western drug war started in Earnest in the third and fourth

00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:55.559
centuries Bishops and Priests were its most prominent backers as a group

00:31:55.559 --> 00:32:01.320
Christian clergy members may have been separated by doctrinal disputes but they

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:06.600
all shared a desire to advance their own political causes priests didn't care

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:12.480
what Romans and Greeks put into their bodies they simply wanted to solidify

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.700
their growing hold on Empire and one of the means of doing so was to assign

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:24.539
legal control over the non-Christian population in a way that assured right

00:32:24.539 --> 00:32:29.940
social control fantastic culture wars people you don't

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:36.059
see any use for them they do and they took down Rome they took down

00:32:36.059 --> 00:32:43.559
Rome you don't think they can take down America yeah yeah what is Cleo tonight we have Cleo with

00:32:43.559 --> 00:32:49.020
us right we got an answer to history here um unable to perform their sacraments

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:56.640
legally the pagans went underground in the process members of pagan religions became politically disenfranchised and

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.980
for the first time in history drugs took on a negative moral connotation

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:10.799
I can't tell you how many thousands of years that I've written well several thousand years worth of medical texts

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:17.039
and you don't see the um Scandal you don't see the they're

00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:23.039
never associated with something bad there's no word for junkie I point that out to people there's no word for junkie

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:29.600
they're never illegal that's absurd they only become illegal

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:36.899
when Christianity takes over yeah they only become illegal and it's a

00:33:36.899 --> 00:33:42.659
way to control the Pagan population wow drugs and drug users like

00:33:42.659 --> 00:33:48.960
prostitutes homosexuals they became taboo and illegal

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:56.299
you know I tell people this all the time and nobody ever believes me but you can read uh a great a book called Greek

00:33:56.299 --> 00:34:02.279
homosexuality by Doe I think it's Dover and um you will find in it that he he

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:08.580
admits right off the bat first couple of pages there's no word in ancient Greek for homosexual

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:13.919
isn't that odd there's no you mean we have so much homosexuality

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:20.720
in Greek tax and then no they never call something homosexual that's odd

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:27.839
homosexuality the very concept is invented to control it's invented to control if you can have

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:33.839
a junkie you can have a homosexual and these are the types

00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:40.080
that we have throughout disenfranchised to tell you their rights

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:45.679
in some cases the property property and their life

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:52.020
this is Christian history this is Christian history

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:59.640
when you have Russians in Georgia who are killing homosexuals

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:04.980
you'll understand their backs they're backed by the church understand that's a

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:11.940
church move people are always shocked what do you think the Middle Ages was that was they used to call it the Dark

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:18.420
Ages and for a good reason for a very good reason if the if if Christianity had

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:23.460
never come about if Jesus hadn't been caught with a naked

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:28.800
kid in a public park at 4am and then executed

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:34.200
you and I be a lot further than we are because the Greeks were coming up with some of the

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:41.780
craziest things there they have a basic computer right calculating the next uh

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:49.560
uh time that you're gonna have an eclipse wow just think just think where we would

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:56.460
be now if we hadn't if if if nature hadn't through Christianity

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:04.680
because ultimately Nature's the Mover nature and through Christianity oppressed the human mind

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:10.740
yeah what would have happened it's amazing let's look back at the priest though we're getting we're going a

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:17.460
little bit long I'm sorry but I want to get you to the priest with the the boys the use of drugs was not the only

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:22.800
physical pleasure made illicit by the early Christians for the first five

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:28.820
centuries of the Common Era priests monks Bishops and church Elders

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:35.880
consistently labored to make sexual intercourse itself an act of moral

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:43.380
contamination and one of the greatest reversals of human history the Western World turned from the embracing sexual

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:51.240
intercourse to considering it a form of pollution one set of facts was constant in all of

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:57.540
Christian priesthood there was a patent open doctrinal hatred

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:04.500
for women homosexuals and drug use the cultural war that started in the

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:09.599
early centuries of the Common Era and ultimately produced modernity was driven

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:15.599
by the ideology of these priests as Bishops gained the ear of the

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:20.880
Imperial bureaucracy the court and eventually the emperor himself They

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.520
promoted the values of exclusivity that have been so successful in bolstering

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.980
their own ranks sex is not healthy

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:38.880
sex is not healthy according to the apostles and the early church fathers sex was not a healthy act that brought

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:45.599
new life into the world as the Pagan World saw it but was the tool of the devil

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:51.960
sex merely distracted the Christian Pilgrim from the path to paradise and as

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:58.380
Paul famously argued was better avoided and you evangelicals and you Catholics

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:04.200
you can put whatever big bow you want on this present it's still a

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:09.240
box full of feces Church fathers like turtleian worked

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:16.800
incessantly to create an image of sex and sexual attraction as strictly negative phenomenon despite the fact

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:23.880
that Bishops were known to keep lovers in the ranks of their virgins early church fathers are unified in their

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:31.079
public condemnation of sexual intercourse as intertalians on the veiling of virgins

00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:39.540
for the Greco-Roman World sex was the highest expression of good for your Evangelical World for ubaptists for you

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:44.640
Baptist wives for you Baptist wives and missionary

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:52.619
um Don't Close Your Eyes there is something not disgusting about

00:38:52.619 --> 00:39:01.140
what you are doing this root of tainting sexuality begins with Christianity

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:06.180
it begins with it and it's it seeps it works its way

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:11.400
through you should read some of these people talk about patristics in the church fathers in the early church well

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:19.380
you should read some of the things if you read some of the things the church father said oh my God it was Jerome who

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:27.420
says the ugliest thing in the world the most hideous defiled object in the a vision in the

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:31.578
world is a pregnant woman

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:42.420
seriously and do you know you base your theology on this man yes your God is a reflection of this man

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:49.560
yes the pre you know the Roman authorities busted in and Alexandria origin cuts off

his privates yeah there's so much in the air there's so much in the air

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:03.599

00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:09.119
highest expression of good and you say wait a minute classes to say wait a minute

00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:14.880
not so absolute but just wait it's coming it was the ultimate beauty that

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:24.440
propelled the natural world forward desire was one of the greatest creative forces

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:30.660
Aphrodite the Goddess of attraction was worshiped in Greece

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:36.180

institutions on Lady Justice where we Thrive under the virgin of democracy

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:32.400

with the use of drugs for example on the island of Cyprus oh and did we get that quote by Ambrose throw that quote by

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:55.680
Amber so bring that one up again she whom the Africans worshipers who we're talking about as the Heavenly one

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:10.980
oh you felt mithras was a boy yes of course you did and you're

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:16.079
surprised that the earliest statues of Aphrodite have a penis

00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:24.480
wow maybe you didn't know everything right right and the multitude is Venus she has

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:31.619
a variety of names but it is not a different Divinity that is a Christian who is describing to you

00:42:31.619 --> 00:42:38.160
the worship of Venus the worship of Aphrodite beautiful Aphrodite's Temple

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:44.940
burned all year round in Cyprus with incense that contain potent

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:51.119
psychotropic Botanicals in the Pagan mind these drugs acted as a conduit through which the goddess could possess

00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:57.180
her mortal followers the sailors used to say you could smell it all the way from before you could see

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:04.500
the island you could smell the incense that was burning and they used that to guide them there right some of those

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:09.720
ships we see sink and they're all full of opium pots

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:15.660
yeah people wondered people ask me are you sure you can't say these things that

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:21.000
people in Antiquity use drugs and I had professors tell me the Romans just

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.079
wouldn't do such a thing um I've got an entire prescription I've got augustus's prescription for opium

00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:35.819
the Opium cocktail he drank do you want to see it it's in a Roman called scribonius largus nobody reads them

00:43:35.819 --> 00:43:42.720
nobody reads them you should yeah dope heads dope heads very

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:48.359
effective dope heads too fantastic beautiful and wine and

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:54.599
Antiquity was not just wine it was a base for mixing alcohol soluble drugs we

00:43:54.599 --> 00:44:01.200
see this in the docks we see this in the pharmacology that nobody ever translates of which there are thousands of pages I

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:07.079
know from my regulars you've heard all of that right um

00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:14.640
like Aphrodite Dionysus was a Mantic God that meant he had a power of Prophecy

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:22.380
the power to explain the past the present and the future the lyric poet anachron in his fragments

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:28.339
makes it clear that Dionysus was nothing less than a news

00:44:28.339 --> 00:44:35.220
Dionysus was the Muse and like Aphrodite Dionysus was worshiped in both the East

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:43.339
and the West whether he was the Osiris of Egypt the Bacchus of Rome or zagreus of Thrace

00:44:43.339 --> 00:44:50.880
Dionysus was the god of intheos the god of intheos and it just means the

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:58.200
God within the god inside he was the God of this the god of possession and according to

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:07.079
the ancient world he always LED his followers they would say to Aphrodite

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:12.480
the purpose when you go to your temple when you

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:21.240
enter into your church the purpose is to guide you Ace afrodite

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:28.020
okay step back and look at your church and ask yourself how impossible is this

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:34.680
you are never going to find Aphrodite ever in one of your churches instead you

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:41.040
will find the hatred that is projected by these early church fathers you find

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:49.680
that hatred just leaking into the services don't tell me you don't submit my students at

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:57.480
University are told to submit learn to submit Anastasia is not going to submit to you

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:04.319
yeah neither will Athena you're disgusting you're disgusting you your

00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:10.740
hands are covered in blood right we should be the theories here we should honor the furies

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:16.800
yeah they punished blood they punished that murder right that Fury is behind

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:25.339
the the followers of Dionysus were almost exclusively women oh fantastic

00:46:25.339 --> 00:46:32.760
imagine that a religion of women that might take you somewhere

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:37.980
might get something done his mean ads ranged across the mountains

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:43.140
screaming and dancing in celebration of their God they were intoxicated divinely

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:50.280
inspired women who freely consumed the wine of the god and thus became maddened

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:59.460
even slaves slaves were free under Bacchus this is a saturnian

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:05.520
practice you bring the slaves there is no slaves there is no free

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:11.819
the first is last and the last is first now you know where Jesus stole that from

00:47:11.819 --> 00:47:17.940
yes holy holy holy Yeah It's All Greek love it

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:24.660
love it the mean ads who follow Dionysus and ultimately Aphrodite celebrated a single

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:30.560
individual someone called the Korah in the Greek language akora is a

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:36.240
post-pubertal girl someone who has recently developed the ability to create

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:42.180
life and the classical mind the Korah was a mortal who had been freshly

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:47.520
initiated into the cyclical Rites of nature she understood The rhythms of

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:55.560
life she understood the power of creativity and she understood the sway of Madness

00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:02.760
the Korra was a young girl just a teenager but so were the gods and goddesses of the ancient world and you

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:09.060
those of you who are sitting here I need you within the satanic congregation and I know I'm going long and I apologize

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:16.319
but I need you to see within the satanic congregation that these divinities are not what you

00:48:16.319 --> 00:48:22.200
think they are when we project um a female Divinity you are not getting

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:31.280
an accurate image okay we're talking about the Korah now the teenage girl

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:38.819
the Greek title Kura is used to describe many goddesses Aphrodite was depicted in

00:48:38.819 --> 00:48:43.859
myth and an art as a quora

00:48:43.859 --> 00:48:50.099
the muses were teenagers the fates were teenagers

00:48:50.099 --> 00:48:55.440
Athena the Korah the queen of the underworld

00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:03.859
herself and Artemis were all teenage girls

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:10.200
interesting so again remember how prominent these Cults are and that when

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:16.200
you come to see the Virgin the statue of the Virgin when you come to worship and

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:23.160
honor those images those Visions realize what their they're celebrating there

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:29.839
realize what they're saying has the power those oracles were those kurai

00:49:29.839 --> 00:49:34.920
there were those girls who were in that state

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:40.980
that nature had brought them to classical civilization is constantly

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:46.140
augmenting the Natural State nature nature nature it's why Paul the Apostle

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:51.480
is walking around raising his hands saying no it's not about nature it's

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:58.500
about Bumpus the invisible power that'll strike you dead if you don't give all your money to him

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:04.920
right right just check out ananias and Sapphira yeah you know what poor fiery

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:11.579
said about ananias and Sapphira yeah dude they got knocked off a couple

00:50:11.579 --> 00:50:17.540
of Christians they sold their property and they held a little cash back for themselves and they got knocked off

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:22.859
Peter James and John knocked them off

00:50:22.859 --> 00:50:29.280
yeah whoo that's Christianity that is what

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.319
took down the Roman Empire you see the brazenness of it you see the

00:50:34.319 --> 00:50:40.859
puttanesque self-reli self uh righteous

00:50:40.859 --> 00:50:47.940
this is the cause only Moscow and Kiev have to be joined it's a he's putting

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:57.000
you into a crusader there's there's nasty people there there's all sorts of Nazis and and homosexuals drug users do

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:04.440
you see this is the Christian way Putin is not Putin is not among a monster

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:12.260
because he was born in the wrong City Putin is a monster because he is absorbing what is coming through history

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:20.520
and using it for his own murderous pleasure yeah

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:27.240
yeah it's disgusting the first oracles the most powerful priestesses of the ancient world were all young girls for

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:33.119
example the teenage girls who made up the chorus that states public performances in honor of the cult of

00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:39.119
Apollo on the island of delos they were among the earliest of oracular

00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:45.839
priestesses in this group people came from all over to see their performances Right singing the dancing it's all a big

00:51:45.839 --> 00:51:53.400
deal it's all a big deal the author of the archaic hymns attributed to Homer celebrates The

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:58.920
Uncanny ability of these girls to engage their audiences in in his hymns to

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:04.680
dealing Apollo young priestesses were referred to as Nightingales and that

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:11.099
title Nightingale is what they call the Muse the voice of inspiration she is

00:52:11.099 --> 00:52:17.940
that Nightingale the order of The Nightingales is attached to the Temple of the muse

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:24.240
yes it's it's gorgeous love it and some of the earliest Lyric poems

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:31.980
um called uh Maiden songs were part of this tradition Maiden songs yes

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:40.619
perhaps the perhaps the maid of Hakeem will write a song about her experience

00:52:40.619 --> 00:52:48.240
the Greeks believe that girls who had recently acquired the ability to produce Offspring were closer to the gods than

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:54.059
any other living human beings they believe these girls were the most divinely inspired they believed they had

00:52:54.059 --> 00:53:00.000
the greatest sense of justice um which having had my own all-girls

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.220
High School class I can tell you for a fact you can't get away with anything if

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:10.859
you're even a thread hypocritical oh my God it's like being under constant

00:53:10.859 --> 00:53:17.940
scrutiny it's like their judgment is laser sharp uh is that a factor of age

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:23.040
is it a factor of um jeans I don't know I don't know but I

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:30.300
can attest I can see you can kind of see why they thought this right why they why they lived their lives this way in short

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:36.420
the ancient Korra earned the right to become the mouthpiece of the cosmos as a

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:43.280
result of these beliefs the beliefs the Greeks created the first Western choruses from the ranks of these girls

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:49.980
these ancient choruses composed hymns In Praise of their gods they performed

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:56.880
public services and pronounced oracles they were educated they were educated

00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:03.000
Priestly colleges you know what priests do was nuns

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.940
in Antiquity the nuns do things with the priests it's the other way around

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:14.940
because the nuns are the ones that are educated you only see these male priests and the

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:22.380
role of recording the divisions that people are having coming out of the oracles right do you ever wonder about that you

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:30.180
ever wonder why Orpheus who is the inspiration for the orphic mystery why it is that he's the student of the

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:36.839
Priestess Medea right it's because even at

00:54:36.839 --> 00:54:43.800
his level of accomplishment it all goes back it all goes back to this female

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:50.819
force all goes back the profound cultural sway of the cult of Aphrodite and Dionysus made them a

00:54:50.819 --> 00:54:56.280
target for priests and Bishops and Christianity Christians knew they would have to destroy the influence of these

00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:02.220
Cults if they would assume uncontested political power furthermore Christian Church fathers

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:08.040
felt obliged to denigrate destroy and uproot the influence of these Cults if

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:13.280
they were to maintain any sort of Spiritual Authority in Rome

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:20.220
I'm gonna skip ahead just a little bit because we're coming to the end I want to just pull up

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:26.040
tertullian his quote from the apology yeah there we go Christian man does not

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:33.000
see the female form with redeemed eyes his soul is blind it's a sexual Allure

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:39.780
it is a targeted attack a cultural war against sexuality

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:45.420
yeah this started by the by the early Christians finishing up here with the social

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:51.300
monster let's go to the social monster in the midst of this struggle for power the Christian leadership under the

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:56.760
direction of Bishops and prominent priests created a social monster they

00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:05.240
created exorcists specialist priests trained to perform the delicate task of uprooting paganism

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:11.839
by preventing any sort of demonic possession

00:56:11.839 --> 00:56:17.400
exorcists come about as a result of possession

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:24.420
okay so what do they do they created Exorcist yes The Exorcist

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:30.599
conducted a ceremony they referred to as the application of the fires of

00:56:30.599 --> 00:56:36.660
Temptation it's just called the fires of Temptation it's the trying

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:44.280
yes anyway it was a secret of Mystery functioning within the mystery right the

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:49.680
Christians are still although it is a corrupted mystery coming through Jesus

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:55.079
they are still performing a mystery and I keep trying to emphasize to everyone

00:56:55.079 --> 00:57:01.619
in the satanic congregation that the mystery is an action it is not a state

00:57:01.619 --> 00:57:07.200
of mind it's not an understanding it's not you sitting somewhere listening to

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:14.839
somebody talk it is an operation it is an operation

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:20.579
it was a secret of Mystery meant to defile young children

00:57:20.579 --> 00:57:25.800
in such a way as to prevent their possession by pegging Gods because you

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:33.420
see once a child has been defiled once a child has been forcefully coerced

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:39.180
into intercourse that child can no longer be possessed

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:49.020
that child cannot be used as an oracle that child cannot be within a priesthood

00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:54.140
once they are defiled

00:57:54.240 --> 00:58:01.800
the Christians know that the Greeks and Romans the Mediterranean cultures are using their

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:10.460
children within these rights and maintaining them as vessels capable of

00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:15.599
absorbing the god of being possessed of carrying the god

00:58:15.599 --> 00:58:22.680
just like Anastasia carries that goddess carries that defender of democracy

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:27.839
these children can't do that if they're horribly attacked

00:58:27.839 --> 00:58:33.480
yes so what do the priests come up with what are the early Christian thinkers

00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:40.980
come up with if we defile them if we put them through

00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:47.460
this terrible mystery um we save their souls isn't that nice

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:52.980
in the process a priest must be it's totally disgusting right but and I'll

00:58:52.980 --> 00:59:01.200
talk about it more and we'll pull out texts next time but they tell the um the

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:07.500
initiate katakuman if you want to call him that right um they tell the initiative they first

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:14.099
of all they starve them for two weeks right I'm sorry it's not funny they starve

00:59:14.099 --> 00:59:21.299
them for two weeks and they indoctrinated the doc the indoctrination is so severe

00:59:21.299 --> 00:59:27.180
that it preps the child for the trauma that is coming they strip them down

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:32.280
naked they have to be naked totally naked they take them into a a basement

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:38.880
an undercroft some kind of place of secrecy right where their screams can't

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:45.119
be heard and a priest will enter who himself takes on

00:59:45.119 --> 00:59:52.500
the devil he takes on the devil and then he forcefully sodomizes the

00:59:52.500 --> 01:00:00.180
child and if the child who has been trained to have this response is able to cry out

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:06.059
I do not accept I do not accept the Temptation flee from

01:00:06.059 --> 01:00:12.359
me devil then that child is guaranteed eat

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:17.700
um a place in that ionic scheme that Jesus talks about when he says I'll give

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:22.980
you a ionic life in that world that child is accepted

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:32.119
because they have been completely purged they have no desire for that form of intercourse right they have no desire

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:39.720
priests following the way of Cain isn't that interesting it's a trial

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:44.760
a Temptation and a child can come through it then we have a catechetical

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:51.140
schools the recommendation in Alexandria the children like this

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:57.720
be counseled after the race baptized right

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:03.480
it's not funny it's not funny in the least but it's ludicrous it's ludicrous

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:11.160
right I mean it's it's creepy and it's and it's so ugly and it's typical

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:17.059
right and it's a very well laid out system to cater to

01:01:17.059 --> 01:01:23.040
pedophiles and rapists yes it's a very very clean system for

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.559
for creating rape yeah um

01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:36.059
but after they baptize them then they have to counsel them after they wash them off they have to counsel them and

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:41.700
it says it can be very difficult and the child will ask you things like why was I

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:46.920
made naked well and you tell them he says it's because Jesus was naked on the

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:52.020
cross right when you're going through that trial

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:58.200
and it's pain and it's bringing pain you are ultimately identifying with Jesus

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:04.980
that's the stuff that goes into them as they're training them before they rape them right so you're setting up this

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:12.359
mindset people say grooming it's not grooming at all it's it's way more vicious and way more in your face

01:02:12.359 --> 01:02:19.680
so yeah yeah um and by passing young boys through the fires of sexual Temptations uh

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:25.740
Temptation priests reinforce the exclusivity of the Christian message in

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:33.420
a strange Twist of History the first rape of children by Christian priests was a means of asserting political and

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:38.579
social dominance over Pagan religions remember all of this is so that these

01:02:38.579 --> 01:02:44.460
kids can't be used in these Pagan practices this is in the mind of the

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:51.420
Creeps who are perpetuating Christianity remember this is a religion of a man who

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:58.079
was arrested in a public park at 4am with a naked boy your institutions are

01:02:58.079 --> 01:03:04.740
built upon it yes yes scrub down everything that is that does

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:10.380
not come through the classical Heritage like democracy you'll see your charities

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:16.319
they're built upon this Creator God

01:03:16.319 --> 01:03:22.440
who has a son who molests children right

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:29.520
right you might as well say you know he doesn't care you know Jehovah doesn't care right because he's he's having

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:35.780
David bash the heads of little babies yeah what does he care right

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:44.339
this you think I sound a little callous this colosity is what drives Celsius

01:03:44.339 --> 01:03:50.640
it's what drives poor fiery yes this has to stop

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:56.819
this has to stop I I want to end um yeah

01:03:56.819 --> 01:04:02.579
I want to end by just bringing it back to Anastasia and her struggle

01:04:02.579 --> 01:04:08.220
to maintain the Ukrainian struggle right now to maintain its identity

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:16.319
right we the Russians abduct the children they teach them Russian and tell them

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:21.540
terrible things about their actual background

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:28.859
in order to wipe out Ukraine in the long run in order to wipe them out in order

01:04:28.859 --> 01:04:35.119
to assimilate and wipe them out and it's happening right now and Anastasia

01:04:35.119 --> 01:04:42.240
Resurrection she will tell you she will tell you about that conflict

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:48.000
they're not just fighting a war over borders

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.819
they are fighting for their life for their survival and

01:04:53.819 --> 01:05:01.079
as an American and as a rationalist as a Satanist and by the way you'll all

01:05:01.079 --> 01:05:07.859
be happy satanic congregation because um Vladimir Putin is now talk according

01:05:07.859 --> 01:05:15.980
to Anastasia is using the image of Satanism to say this is what's being

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:23.099
promulgated in Ukraine satanic he'll probably say the same thing about Georgia when he invades

01:05:23.099 --> 01:05:28.559
Georgian we all stand around and look at each other funny right or Moldova when

01:05:28.559 --> 01:05:36.680
he starts spreading out to any of the countries that he can where he can molest the people and murder the people

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:43.740
and and Destroy in his wake right and the Christians applaud

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:49.200
