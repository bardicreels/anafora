for this you know form of hypnosis that we're doing here because that's really

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.920
where you have to go to get into these sources you have to get into the mind of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.040
the people there you have to be in the spot so that when they start using this

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.220
vocabulary and talking about their ritual you're seeing it through their eyes you're seeing it through their eyes

and it turns out it turns out that he is able to be bound

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:26.280
by the verbal command of a priest who is exercised in the

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:31.740
mystery all right

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:38.340

of intoxicating you right for you to enter into a state of mania Mania right

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:52.740
this whole drug vocabulary people don't realize this but there's nobody ever reads these texts but

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:58.740
um there's a whole drug vocabulary let's go to another let's go to the next one boink

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:02.960
maybe get a close-up on that yeah

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:09.720
yeah um just look at the um we're looking at monicos here right

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:16.520

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:23.340
usually you know to an extreme mad or extravagant you see in definition number

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:28.620
two there right that's nice but I want you to look for the drugs we got to look for the

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:35.760
drugs does anybody see any drugs here oh I do look at the bottom there it was like two sentences from the bottom there

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.640
um Pharmaca right so you can have this

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:46.679

00:28:46.679 --> 00:28:53.940
drugs demonic drugs and what are the manic drugs the manic drugs the drugs that put you into a place of mania you

00:28:53.940 --> 00:29:02.340
haven't been to church unless you've been under the influence of these drugs okay that is what is going on

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:08.820
and look at that they have money uh well that's okay we don't need that one okay next uh next

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:16.740
yeah look at this look at this yeah yeah nice good for sleeping and they say

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:22.380
that's nice and awesome convenient sleeping places just keep going down

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:29.159
going down going down until we get to the very bottom look at Roman numeral number two as a verb

00:29:29.159 --> 00:29:36.659
right here we've got to stupefy with narcotics okay so this isn't just to

00:29:36.659 --> 00:29:45.000
give narcotics this is to stupefy and notice the root is Epsilon Upsilon Nu

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.640
Epsilon Upsilon new um where have you guys seen this before

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:58.020
does this look like the Elia root oh it may be it may be huh so there's a

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:04.200
connection look there's a connection to marriage there's a connection of sex why why is there a connection because in the

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:09.899
right bring me up in the right in the right we're dealing with sex and drugs

00:30:09.899 --> 00:30:17.100
we are dealing with sex and drugs you cannot perform the mystery without the

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:22.140
sex and the drugs you can't do it the music

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:28.919
the music makes everything work that's what they said yeah they said the music was more

00:30:28.919 --> 00:30:36.120
important than than even the drugs which I thought I've always found that fascinating must be something within the

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:43.279
you know you get taken up in it and off you go right next thing you know you're dead on the floor and they're like oh

00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:49.140
revive him right and we've got the stuff in our hair these hallucinogens that are

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:56.720
what these are not pleasant hallucinogens this is not you see people today with the mushroom or

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:02.940
the mushroomery and how nice it is because it helps to heal you from your

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:08.100
traumatic yeah experiences at least that's what they're trying to research

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:15.960
all right see if it does um this is a different angle this is uh turn you crazy turn your crazy on for a

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:24.539
few hours turn your crazy on for a few hours and when we're all done you can sleep it off

00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:31.260
all right fantastic you tell the priests on the way out what'd you say right right where you been let's get it

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:37.440
down yep who said what right what are the messages what are the

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:44.880
oracles isn't that fantastic let's go to we've got another dictionary I know I'm going over but

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:51.240
we've got a um look at this here I just wanted you to see this word for lot

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:57.899
I wanted you to see this word for lot known Us in that passage that we just

00:31:57.899 --> 00:32:03.539
looked at Nana says the priest

00:32:03.539 --> 00:32:10.860
who sings that prayer right that prayer is a song

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:16.080
that you are singing to the divinity

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:23.399
yeah it's a song the audience is the Divinity the power the diamond the demon

00:32:23.399 --> 00:32:28.679
the succubus the incubus depending on whether you're in or out

00:32:28.679 --> 00:32:34.380
yeah those songs are the activations of that

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:41.059
power so laughs

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:47.279
nowness tells us there is an inherent

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:53.279
power in this thing

00:32:53.279 --> 00:33:00.440
this is our device it's a noetic it's a it's a brain

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:07.420
voice a brain voice bring up that last

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:15.840
[Music] yeah lachos only the concept of voice is

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:24.179
is embodied in lot in Lots remember we're necromancers

00:33:24.179 --> 00:33:31.380
how do we bring the logos we bring the logos via the lot

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:37.260
yeah if you were paying attention you would have seen the stars yourself

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:43.019
and you would have been able to go to where he was and give him what he

00:33:43.019 --> 00:33:50.159
needed yes you find those you find those children

00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:58.679
right you find those children within the right the mystery I've got news okay I know this is gonna upset people by the

00:33:58.679 --> 00:34:05.760
way I'm still reading as many comments as I possibly can um yeah and yeah there's a lot of stuff

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:12.960
good stuff in there but uh we have to go to a place that's not it's

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:20.040
kind of sensitive and kind of you know when the Dalai Lama was kissing that I was kissing that boy I was

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:26.520
thinking to myself look okay this is the closest you're gonna get to Jesus

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:32.280
with the naked kid this is the closest you're gonna get this is kind of Jesus I

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:38.940
mean come on right is there is there much difference right you know

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:45.000
then nobody should be offended by that right nobody should be offended I hope the Christians are offended to compare

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.080
Jesus to Buddha oh that's not bad um okay we could throw we could throw I

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:58.020
don't think we quite quite throw Moses and although Moses was cranking with the with the Venoms and this is the new area

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:06.599
by the way people right this is the new era watch what those Venoms do bring back those serpents around the pole and

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:13.859
watch what happens right watch what happens to the medicine yeah oh this is gorgeous I love it I

00:35:13.859 --> 00:35:18.900
love this very much um so it's how is he doing that it's with that

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:26.700
it's with that lot that he is able to cast and catch in

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:33.839
time just boom in order to pull down that power from the Star right he uses

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:39.960
the lot that's how they always know the future right and you think to yourself oh wait

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:45.119
a minute there is that funny connection right between you know divination and

00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:52.079
casting the Lots yes there is and it's a principle of randomization that's nice all that stuff is nice what what's

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:58.820
important for us is that in the text we not only see a very unique

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:05.520
creation of lightning but but we see it in a way that shines

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:11.339
light on the Apocalypse

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:17.700
so that soon we'll be able to

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:22.880
chart the stars and say we are here

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:28.320
welcome to the Apocalypse thanks for coming tonight

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:35.030
hail Satan [Music]
