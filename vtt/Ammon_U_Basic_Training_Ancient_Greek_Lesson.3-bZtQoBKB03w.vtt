00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.239
Greek it's very important very important um eye opening Enlightenment stuff and

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.640
tonight we're going to do that but in order to get there we've got to start

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.760
somewhere that you're not going to want to be where are we going we're going to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:31.280
the Back Alley we're going to that place where people get

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.879
seduced they get seduced I want you satanic

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:46.480

tale I want you to be so rooted and reason people have to give you a coat

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.720
like a scientist and call you Melvin listen to me very carefully

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.360
tonight we're going to look at an example of how you can be taken into the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.360
back alley um it's very easy and uh let's all stay together come on let's

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.519
don't get anybody get lost out there this is a scary scary place all right

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:27.519
I'm gonna hit you with the clip first and I want you to look at this clip and I want you as classical philologists to

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.760
realize your place is a place of examining evidence you are

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.959
investigators you examine evidence none of us care about

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:46.400
arguments arguments are sold and bought evidence is what will take us to

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.040
the history so I want you to be listening for that go ahead what did the Greeks want to do

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.799
they want to destroy Judaism so that's why I say that when you think of Greek don't think of think

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.439
think of it as German the reason why you would bristle the idea that a holy book would be written in

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:11.159
German I don't need to tell you what happened 85 years ago so Greek wasn't

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:18.320
just another language it was the enemy language it was the language represent everything that was vile everything that

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.840
was ungodly moreover bear in mind people may say well the writers of the New

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.880
Testament they just were Greek speakers Christians insist that the authors of the

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.360
gospels and the letters the Epistles found in the Christian Canon were

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.639
divinely inspired they're not just the Recollections of evangelists no they

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.919
were divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit by the Holy Ghost really that

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:56.360
means that means god inspired these people to write in Greek did the Holy

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.919
Spirit forget Hebrew and Aramaic and this a massive problem for the church

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.160
that's why there are books out that when God began to speak Greek like they have

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.280
to explain this away it's a very big problem did the Holy Spirit

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.600
speak Hebrew and Aramaic this is the difficulty do you

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.840
hear how we're not looking at evidence right we're scientists and we need to stand back we need in order to

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:35.479
understand history we have to look at all the data that we've been given that's the that's history and you and I

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:42.000
are philologists are dat is all that Greek now the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.280
impression this is the this is the very um this is the

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.440
stealth of the whole um creation of the fairy tale people are

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:03.280
speaking Hebrew and Aramaic fantastic fantastic I want you to keep

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.319
that in mind because I'm going to show you something um we know that by this

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:14.800
time there was no he spoken Hebrew nope and I'll show you that in a second so um

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.039
the Greek that is in Antiquity that is the language of literature the Romans

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:29.599
You' be proud of this the Romans used to say um uh the Greeks yeah although they

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:35.520
were conquered by us they conquered us with that gorgeous

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.240
gorgeous hot language it's right it's right it's

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:49.160
right um so let's look for the data like in Hebrew ancient Hebrew there are only

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.280
8,000 unique words in ancient Greek somewhere around 1.5 million why the

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.599
difference right hit um chewy hit us another star system please yes it's

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:08.479
written in a language that's not just not Jewish not Hebrew not Aramaic it's written in the enemy language it's

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:16.680
written in the ungodly language the language of helenismo and most importantly mostos

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.479
Germain for us because you're a child of Hashem you want to do the right thing

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:29.919
like why is there these Greek ideas the idea of a a demiurge that

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:35.960
Satan is a lord of this world in 2 Corinthians 4:4 it's it's the ideas that

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:41.639
are conveyed in Christianity that are Greek rather than Hebrew thank you so

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:49.720
much for your thoughtful question if you enjoy this program please like And

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:56.319
[Music]

subscribe okay did you get the pitch there did did you get the pitch there anybody who wants to purchase or

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:11.599
merchandise feel free now the problem is the things that we're not seeing is the

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:18.120
very obvious I want you to be on alert I want you to be on alert whenever someone

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:23.479
starts talking in generalities generalities don't stand up

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:29.599
to even a decade of antiquity you cannot say

00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:35.518
these people do that at the same time as those people do that this is such a mixture of

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:41.839
Mediterranean and cultures from Asia Minor um long long long histories

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:47.920
languages Galore right it's we're flooded with data so we don't need to be

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:54.519
making generalities be careful when somebody says Bible times realize oh in

00:08:54.519 --> 00:09:00.920
Bible times something happen that is scientifically and Ling linguistically

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.680
absurd it's absurd at its best at its worst it's intentionally

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:14.880
deceptive so but it's something that monism does Scholars hate this and that's why

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:22.880
classes don't treat the Bible because they know these are the guardians of the

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.200
fairy tale of the fairy tale are you ready for this I just want to hit you

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:35.040
with a piece of um okay get ready to reset yourself and you're thinking are you

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.200
ready let's just look at the facts we're talking about Hebrew in the first

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:45.720
century let's see let's see what we've got here give me the first facts watch

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:52.720
this people you can find this on you can find this on any old encyclopedia right what is Hebrew it's

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:59.560
closely related to Phoenician and moabit we don't have any more that one with with which it is often placed by scholar

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.640
in a Canaanite subgroup spoken in ancient times in Palestine now wait a

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:11.600
minute did you hear it star to creep in that was the creeper in ancient times what are you

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:19.120
talking about there's 3,000 years of time all over the the Western World what

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:26.000
are you talking about ancient times he um what happened um spoken in ancient

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.720
times in Palestine Hebrew was supplanted uhoh what are they recognizing here

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.160
they're recognizing that Hebrew died Hebrew was a small tribal language that

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:45.000
died and by the time it got to the level of being able to communicate itself Greek came along and

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.160
went squash just like she did many many many other

00:10:53.160 --> 00:11:00.680
languages many other languages the real irony is that the person that was just

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:08.839
speaking to you about Hebrew and about evil Greek their

00:11:08.839 --> 00:11:15.360
ancestors were Greek speakers that's the irony of the

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.200
history it died out Watch What Happens people Hebrew was supplanted by and they

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.880
propose Aramaic possibly funny aren't they they're funny

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:34.760
was there any Aramaic no what's going on we're trying to explain

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:41.800
the facts that we've got and the monest have to stick to a narrative they have

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:49.720
to if the if the Old Testament is not Hebrew everyone's in big trouble and God

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:55.639
has a birthday God has a birthday hit it Chey

00:11:55.639 --> 00:12:05.639

jeh it was in the thir Century thank you Ault examiner and

00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:33.160
chewy for bringing us that g Watch What Happens people um this is in the 3

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.680
Century notice that they say it's in the 3 Century right that's when we know it's

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:45.920
it's gone it was revived look what they say the language was lurgical how many times have I told

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:53.240
you that how many times have I told you that we are talking about a language that was dead do you know who's talking

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:59.600
about that language that was dead people talking in Greek

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:07.639
now granted at this time at this time um the world is being

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:14.440
swamped swamped by the language but something is happening to

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:21.519
Mother Greek too yeah she is aging she's aging and that should not be

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:27.040
happening we have things creeping into the language and ultimately we get this

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:36.079
thing called coinet it's a coin a from the attic dialect and it is

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:43.959
corrupted it's corrupted it's being dumbed down it's

00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:52.279
commonality is having to pay for absorbing people who have not worked

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:59.240
with Greek who were not born with Greek yeah all sorts of cultures all all

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:05.320
over the Mediterranean they're having to absorb this you see when you learn history you learn dates and you learn

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:12.279
people's names and that garbage is useless it takes away from the focus of

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:18.800
the nature that the Greeks were so focused on the nature of

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.000
language the nature of language okay give me the next one the uh give me the

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.360
next one yeah we're talking about natural beauty here watch this people here's another little ENT look at this

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:37.480
classical Hebrew we've got the Hebrew language is divided into four major periods now watch this pay attention

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:44.040
biblical or classical Hebrew what is wrong with the commas this person does not understand commas until about the 3

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:52.759
Century BC now they're telling you Biblical Hebrew is that which goes up to the 3 Century BC but wait a minute how

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:58.240
many biblical texts do we have from this period do we have the letters of Isaiah

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.360
no do we have the Genesis of Moses no do

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:10.079
we have anything no you mean we have nothing of biblically

00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:18.959
zero do you know why this article says that Biblical Hebrew Hebrew

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:24.560
exists without having any any documents written in that language imagine if I

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.680
were to say you know what in my backyard some people spoke a language and it was

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:37.360
called blah and blah was so expressive um show us some

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:44.759
blah uh I got no blah fill in the blank people this is

00:15:44.759 --> 00:15:51.120
not science right you cannot say the period

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.440
when this language was spoken if there are no remains of the

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:04.000
language zero zip NADA now watch what watch what they say

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.120
here in that line um until about the third Century in which most of the Hebrew Bible is

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.720
written and really it's written in this period G give me some of it oh it's you

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:22.839
don't have any of it that right there that you just saw that you just read we just read together

00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:29.959
that is an illusion that's an illusion we are song

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:35.800
and dancers do you know what we are we are singers and dancers and we are

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:42.399
singing and dancing here um let's keep going um now what comes after it after

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:48.880
it comes mishnaic or rinic Hebrew and you say aha there's the language I've

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:55.199
got the language right there this man alond is a fool look they're speaking

00:16:55.199 --> 00:17:02.399
Hebrew written about 200 CE what what this form of Hebrew look

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:07.558
what's in the parenthesis right when somebody takes you into the back alley

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:13.798
and they start saying funny things look for what's in the parentheses what's in the parenthesis here somebody read it

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:20.120
this form of Hebrew was never used among the people as a spoken language what are

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:26.798
these people speaking Greek why did Jesus what did Jesus speak

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:32.559
Greek nobody spoke Hebrew it had been dead for years it did not have the

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:42.240
stamina God's tongue took a dive yes Watch What Happens here

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:48.799
people so from about the sixth to the 13th century an OD doin when many words

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:56.400
were being bur uh look what are they doing borrowing now we're going to try to bring it back we got to revive this

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:03.799
corpse and what are we going to do naturally we're just going to use the words that we're speaking natively Greek

00:18:03.799 --> 00:18:11.520
Spanish Arabic I don't know if these are the languages of the ungodly I don't know but scientific do

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.600
you hear how that's an argument you don't want to be bathed in arguments you

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:23.799
want the evidence the science anybody here this is a freaking Temple to

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:29.400
reason the Muse my friend is the result

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:37.720
of of a process of creation everything around you is that

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.960
nature isn't that fundamentally kind of mind altering if

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:48.240
you can't follow anything but science wow think about

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:55.400
that you could almost never you could you could almost never be let astray no

00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.480
no facts won't Lead You astray look at the evidence go to the next one one one

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:08.039
more of these and then I'm going to call on the drill instructor um lots of good news from him the Hebrew of the Bible

00:19:08.039 --> 00:19:13.559
exhibits little dialectical variety now this one's important it

00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:19.799
seems like it's a side note so all of these books that are in the Bible you

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:25.240
mean they don't have any dialectical differences period as if the same person

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:30.799
wrote them yeah as if one person or one group

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:38.880
of people wrote this work all these different books The Books of Moses the prophets the Psalms they're all written

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.679
by the same people by one group at one time in the

00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:50.600
third Century they left their F fingerprints all over it and what

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:56.600
language did they have to use they had to use Greek they had to use Greek because

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:05.840
that's all they had you can not write a work if if you're not native if you

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:11.880
don't have that language inside and out of you yeah you can't use the idiom it's

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:17.559
the idiom the idiom stains you watch I'm going to show you a little idiom here in a second give me the next comment this

00:20:17.559 --> 00:20:22.799
is fantastic people none of us is going to be deceived here anymore none no back

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:30.520
alleys we will stay tell me teacher we will stay the the straight and narrow

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:36.960
watch this Biblical Hebrew in the in its widest sense Biblical Hebrew refers to the spoken language of ancient Israel

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:44.159
flourishing between 1,000 BC that's a nice that's a right cap do we have a document from of course we don't right

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:50.799
1,00 BC to 400 CE it comprises several evolving and

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:56.799
overlapping dialects look it's it's almost like they don't have a there's no scientific standards here for their

00:20:56.799 --> 00:21:04.080
definitions the phases of classical Hebrew are often named after important literary works really

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:11.720
really like the mishnaic Hebrew right a non-spoken

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:18.400
language fantastic give me the next one what is going on with this israelian

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:25.000
Hebrew is a proposed wait is a proposed as soon as you hear proposed that trench

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.720
code is coming off yeah the look you can expect it now you're in

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:36.000
trouble don't be thinking where's Mom and Dad no you're done

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.520
for a a proposed Northern dialect of Biblical Hebrew believed well at least

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:50.400
they're admitting that this is not a matter of science but a matter of Faith at least they're admitting that

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:56.480
believed to have existed in all erors of the language in some cases competing

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:02.919
with that look at how look at how incred L contorted and you know detailed is

00:22:02.919 --> 00:22:08.080
their belief right the B seriously is this the

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:15.080
best your Scholars can do yes yes one for the scholars one for the scholars

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.600
all you language Scholars you lazy

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:27.960
people shame on you shame on you for abandoning the art go to the next one

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:34.480
shy quickly quickly I want to bring the sergeant and here we go it one more well

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.559
look at this look at this is Israeli and Hebrew IH is a northern dialect now this

00:22:39.559 --> 00:22:45.880
one didn't say that they don't have any of this but this fish doesn't exist this

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:53.360
is a hypothesized fish have you seen it have you drawn it out do you know where it has it's young what does

00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:00.240
it do what environment no none of that this is an imaginary fish

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:06.799
this is an imaginary fish blow it up cheery blow it up um proposed well there

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:12.240
finally they it proposed as an explanation for the various irregular

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:18.919
linguistic features of the Matic text now what are they talking about when you read the Bible you are reading an

00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:25.000
English translation or a Spanish translation or something you're reading a

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.240
translation of the Matic text and when is the azaric Hebrew text when is it

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:38.039
invented it is invented in 1000 on OD Domin you mean we're not even a thousand

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:45.799
we're a thousand years off the mark yes you meant to land in the Sea of Tranquility you landed on

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:50.960
Mercury oh my God my God biblical

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:58.600
Scholars what is wrong with you watch what happens it competes with the alternative Oh look The Irregular engl

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.919
linguistic features so we have the mastic text but it's

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:09.440
irregular why do you think they have problems you don't hear classus is

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:16.400
talking about you know what Homer that guy's IR regular no no no no no no don't

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:22.039
play games what's happening with your text people it's falling apart it

00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:27.559
complete competes with the alternative explanation that such features are arism

00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:34.240
now look what they did did they so want to include something that sounds legitimate they're going to pull in

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:40.679
Aramaic Aramaic is that substitute for reality the reality that we need to

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:46.720
understand is this stuff didn't exist in Antiquity do you know what was there

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:53.480
Greek and she was eating everybody up the good news is that after Greek met

00:24:53.480 --> 00:25:02.000
its decline in into the influences of the first in centuries BC and

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.799
AD after she started to meet her kin a group of very enthusiastic people you

00:25:09.799 --> 00:25:17.600
could call them I don't know a satanic congregation they came up they came up

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:24.840
with a method they said we're going to re-inject the glory that was Athens do you remember all the evil things that

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:32.640
helenismo see do you remember the real evil thing

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.589
that [Music]

00:25:38.679 --> 00:25:44.120
helenismo democracy that comes through a

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:52.080
language and that language has the capacity to make you

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:59.039
aware yeah do you know the science that the Greek teaches that science can put

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:05.960
anybody anybody who's trying to take you into a back alley put it to shame put some to shame Lady Justice is right

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.919
there with her let's go to the next one watch this people and then I'm I'm just

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:17.880
wait I'm gonna call on the drill instruct give me another 10 minutes and I'm gon call on you

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:24.880
di this is a great sentence lifted from Deuteronomy 7

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:30.159
Deuteronomy 72 KT

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:46.000
oh now watch this on the second line do you hear

00:26:49.960 --> 00:27:00.580
that do you see what they're doing now watch he's gonna do it again [Music]

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:07.640
de do you hear what's going on it's something helenistic grace particularly

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:16.120
love to do they love to take a verb because they're Smarties right they've learned how the language Works they've

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:23.320
learned the Mastery of how that causes you to grow in your frin in that place

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:29.840
that you perceive causes you to grow and you know they've gotten clever and they'll here's

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:36.640
what we're going to do we're going to take a verb the action word and we're going to take a noun the person place or

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:42.840
thing and we're going to take those two things we're going to make one word the verb and it's going to have the this

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:48.720
root and then we're going to take the same route and we're going to have the noun use the noun from that

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:55.240
root right it's a little bit of repetition it breaks up and makes them remember this

00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:01.720
is musical right lots of lots of non-musical languages out there lots of

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:09.519
them like our stupid anglosaxon right speaking of Anglo-Saxons check

00:28:09.519 --> 00:28:17.720
out old boy who is doing an outstanding service by running around tracking down

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:24.360
tracking down the purple in his backyard and um going to some of these

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:30.039
places and talking talk he was talking to someone I'll give you a little bit ofe preview I don't think he'd mind um

00:28:30.039 --> 00:28:37.919
Al Boy going to be going to be looking at more purple that they're still finding oh God oh God it's wonderful

00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:43.760
people who said the apocalypse who was that person who said this was going to be

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:49.960
impossible to you naysayers let's go back to that verse let's go back to that

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:57.480
verse what does this verse say um it brings up something um that I wanted to show you the style the style of this

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:06.480
line the these lines um is Greek it's not only colloquial um it's scient it's

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:12.200
excuse me it's stylistically Greek does is the Hebrew able to keep

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:17.519
this up no of course not because the Hebrew is a translation of this how are

00:29:17.519 --> 00:29:23.000
they supposed to invent words oh God if you've only got 8,000 you've got to

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.640
start inventing right it's the way it is we do the same thing in English right our

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.760
Anglo-Saxon ancestors they the same thing you borrow remember the Hebrew that we're talking about in the Middle

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.840
Ages that they're trying to revive this dead corpse what are they doing they're taking Greek they're taking Spanish

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:48.159
they're pulling it all in they're taking German right right and by the way by the way no

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:54.760
you know what let's stay above The Fray people let's keep ourselves let's keep ourselves in the dignified Zone I think

00:29:54.760 --> 00:30:00.279
we'd all like that I think we'd all like that um give me the next one we're going to fly

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:08.279
through a couple of these Bo I just wanted you to see yeah here's that AA nmos and I want you to see um we've got

00:30:08.279 --> 00:30:14.240
a little bit of creepage in our definition because remember the editors there's a whole bunch of editors to the

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:20.080
Oxford um Greek Lexicon and they will group they will do

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:25.960
something that you saw that guest or guest speaker today that you saw him

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:32.360
doing um that there is a what they do is they say look there are there are monists and then there is the culture in

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:39.679
which monists live and the monism creates this barrier where you

00:30:39.679 --> 00:30:48.640
don't know what your neighbor is doing you don't speak his language you don't use his toothpaste you don't do anything like that right um that never exists

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:55.880
it's an impossibility it's like living in a bubble nobody lives in a bubble you're stained with everything around

00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:04.080
you everything around you and so it's creeping in in section A with the word extermination right what is afano in

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:11.240
Greek it means to destroy to obliterate to um wipe to take away

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.600
entirely right show me the verb chewy it's next when you think wait a minute isn't that the same thing as

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:23.320
extermination no it's not watch to do away with to remove right something that

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:30.919
is concealed something that is concealed right to secret away or steal something

00:31:30.919 --> 00:31:37.480
to obscure do you hear where aano is going right has to do with whether or

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:43.639
not you can see it it's a the alpha privative plus F the base that means to

00:31:43.639 --> 00:31:50.480
appear so it's not appearing fantastic give me the next one

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:56.399
how does this stuff get translated on the Hebrew side um yeah de

00:31:56.399 --> 00:32:02.519
go to the this one how does this stuff get translated on the no go down here on

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:13.559
the Hebrew side let's just jump to it haram to ban to devote to

00:32:13.559 --> 00:32:20.600
exterminate yeah what is the concept here do you want to know what is

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:27.200
uniquely Hebrew if you do it's really you know it's fascinating because they left us to

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:33.639
septu and then attempted to translate it um it's very interesting that you can pick

00:32:33.639 --> 00:32:40.279
out you can filter out the cultural influences from the Hebrew this word

00:32:40.279 --> 00:32:47.679
haram is very specific in context all the time and it means to take a group of

00:32:47.679 --> 00:32:53.360
people and wipe them out to take a group of people and

00:32:53.360 --> 00:33:01.240
dedicate them to your god of death wait a minute what check this out check

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:06.360
this out I know the we don't get the concept in Greek we're trying to creep

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:12.799
off anisus toward it but we can't quite get there right because that evil

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:18.840
language of helenismo language of

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:28.559
helenismo bro lots of different people there are no

00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:33.639
races there's only two types of people in the world say the Greeks right which

00:33:33.639 --> 00:33:39.840
Greeks the Athenians do you know what they said when the language was that it's peaked you know what they said it's

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:47.039
not about it's not about races it's about your language there are those of us who know

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:53.960
mother Greek and those of us who don't and those who don't speak

00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:01.399
like no music in them what soever you want to be one of those people you want

00:34:01.399 --> 00:34:09.480
to be one of those Anglo-Saxons you want to be one of those osin you want to be a Roman with your

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.679
Latin all right let's go next one down I think it's time for me to call in call

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:22.800
in the sergeant um yeah yeah yeah um because what do we do oh I just wanted

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:29.599
to see um we've got extremities of age here and we're always talking about about that naked kid with Jesus he was a

00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:35.679
anise ghost well we've got The Young and the old we've got the extremes who are

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:42.520
the people that we kill who are the people that we perform complete and

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:48.520
total genocide upon in Antiquity who are these

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:54.839
people that we do this to those who are outside of the monest

00:34:54.839 --> 00:35:00.920
box right and who do we kill the Young from the youngest to the

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:06.079
oldest men and women and and what else

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:11.440
even their cattle all right their calves those

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:17.400
animals they use that come under the Yoke you know what I'm talking about

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:22.520
those Works those work animals kill them all what are you going to kill him with

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:27.760
you're going to kill him with an edge of the edge of the sword what about the gold

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:34.680
the gold you dedicate to the service of God this

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:40.640
concept is not helenistic it is

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:46.880
not why because mother Greek Embraces

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.440
everyone yeah they were giving themselves over people were giving

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:57.640
themselves over fantastic amazing um let me call

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:03.079
call in I think that's it is we got one more one more chewy and then we're going to bring in the drill sergeant people

the next one nothing left let them you know we kill them all right that's the

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:41.359
way go um look at the uh this is the concept right this is the nonh

00:36:41.359 --> 00:36:46.599
helenistic concept when you're taking that that that filter and you're shaking

00:36:46.599 --> 00:36:52.920
out the Rocks you know what I mean all the dust is following to the falling down there on the bottom and all you got

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:58.119
left are these bigger rocks on the top this is what you shake out okay now

00:36:58.119 --> 00:37:03.560
check out the bottom of this this is the concept in Hebrew of

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:12.119
genocide look at the bottom comment pull up the bottom pull up the bottom comment again this is ancient um the stuff that

00:37:12.119 --> 00:37:17.760
we think was at a certain time but we don't have any of it surviving so let's

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:23.319
see what here we go people read this what is this thing thing hostile to

00:37:23.319 --> 00:37:29.400
theocracy and therefore to be either destroyed or in the case of certain

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:36.680
objects I.E or AG silver and gold vessels of brass and iron there's no

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:43.240
reason to destroy that s set apart to Sacred uses that's what we need to do

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:50.400
this is part of a word this is part of a word it's an

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:56.560
expression Of Human Action it's an expression Of Human

Alpha Delta Epsilon Lambda Fe Omron sigma look

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:51.960
at that Sigma on the end that's the terminal Sigma it's the one that looks like the

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:58.520
snake otherwise it's a little it's an Omron with a little tail on the top part

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:03.720
of it looking to the east fantastic what's its genitive form

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:10.680
ad Del Fu now what's going on look at that those last two vowels are Omron

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:15.800
oilon and those two vowels are what you call a diff thong people have said I saw

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:21.800
you I saw you writing about what's a diff thong what's a diff thong it's just two vows stuck together and it comes

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:28.640
together to make a different sound Omron a oilon o what happens when you bring ow

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:34.800
together you get ooh ah here a little bit of that diagma

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:43.839
little bit of that Dima stuck in that oops W that's the W sound o nice nice and it's definite article is

00:44:43.839 --> 00:44:51.599
H that looks different from hey yes because hey is feminine H is

00:44:51.599 --> 00:44:57.760
masculine to is neuter H he to all words

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:04.920
for the that's called the definite article and you will know a nouns

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:10.400
gender because of its definite article oh God now are there exceptions that of

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:17.520
course there are sometimes H sometimes things are not so obvious but

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:23.760
99.9999% of the time I want you to hold this notion the definite article shows

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.839
you the gender of the noun you want to see the gender of a n come here now come

00:45:28.839 --> 00:45:37.240
here now let me see that gender let me see oh this one is neuter how do you tell that you tell it

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:44.079
from the definite article that's what that tale is giving you there pay attention to it give me the next one

00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:52.680
boom boom anthropos anthropo you know this thing has got a

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:59.359
masculine definite article on it what is an anthropos it's a person don't say man

00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:07.839
I know your book translates it that way it's not it's a general person the

00:46:07.839 --> 00:46:14.680
anthropology is the studying the people yes gorgeous one thing I want you to

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:20.599
notice what this word is doing it's now there's something going on here that you can't hear there's something going on

00:46:20.599 --> 00:46:26.720
and I love your frightened frightened little Minds I love them I love them oh

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:33.079
God God it's like okay let's not go there anthropos

00:46:33.079 --> 00:46:38.200
look where the accent is it's over Alpha don't be afraid people for th for those

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:45.119
of you who are not afraid um something's wrong with you you should be right but for those of you who

00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:51.440
are afraid everybody everybody don't worry the drill Sergeant's yelling at

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:58.599
everyone right just follow my instructions look at the accent on this thing it's over the alpha but what

00:46:58.599 --> 00:47:05.960
happens on the genitive the accent jumps to the Omega it goes from anthropos to

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:13.280
onu and why do we do that because the ending of the word has a diff thong diff thongs are long they're

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:19.079
long and what happens what do you mean long extra time for you it's extra time

00:47:19.079 --> 00:47:25.240
and when you put that much time into something it's going to drag that accent toward it it's like

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:31.760
gravity this is all musical it's all musical right Greek now there's a lot of

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:37.040
classical Scholars out there and you can walk up to one and um you know get their

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:43.800
attention slap them you know shake them do hey classical philologist tell me

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:51.359
something right tell me something um was ancient Greek Musical and they will have to say

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:57.400
Yes um unfortunately we're not going to be able to Plum the depths of of that

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:03.359
musicality this is something you'll develop you'll develop a little bit of

00:48:03.359 --> 00:48:10.200
appreciation but to the level that the Greeks had it going it's the reason they could say there's two types of people in

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:16.240
were those who speak Greek and those who don't right the division of the Jew and

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:24.400
the Gentile in the sep is a reflection of this very

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:29.800
idea you say I thought the ungod ly helenistic Greek I thought it was you

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:35.880
know something came later that no no no do you see why you have to fabricate

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:43.000
history by assuming the langu there was a language back then it was called ancient Hebrew do you see why you have

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:50.359
to fabricate that history if you're a theologian or a monest because the authority is in the

00:48:50.359 --> 00:49:00.119
language and if you don't have a language you don't have authority yeah yeah it's an uh it's it's

00:49:00.119 --> 00:49:06.839
an attempt it's an attempt to adapt good let's go to the next one give me another

elements that we're dealing with that's it it's just physics there's no um

00:50:00.599 --> 00:50:06.839
reasoning that you're going to be um needing put away your calculators people

00:50:06.839 --> 00:50:13.200
are shocked when I say that but when they come into Greek I tell them you're going to have a problem

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:20.680

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:57.359
yourself the Greeks um during the first century um to

00:52:57.359 --> 00:53:05.319
the about second anod Domin um first BC they're very fond of this concept think

00:53:05.319 --> 00:53:10.680
about this think about this intellectually the contrast

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:16.119
between logos and eron what is

00:53:16.119 --> 00:53:21.799
logos logos is Reckoning what is

00:53:21.799 --> 00:53:27.200
Aron doing what is the difference between

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:32.720
Reckoning and doing is there some sort of

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:40.240
magic physics going on between Reckoning or reasoning and

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:45.280
making acting is there a difference between

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:51.119
action and being linguistically the

00:53:51.119 --> 00:53:58.359
garans are quick to point out that this is just the difference between a verb

00:53:58.359 --> 00:54:05.160
and a noun yeah yeah yeah what does the verb

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:15.599
do it can do two things right it can be or it can do can be or it can do

00:54:15.599 --> 00:54:21.000
eron logos eron logos what is wrapped up

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.319
in the verb eron and logos what is your

00:54:27.319 --> 00:54:36.440
noun your noun is just those things that are affected by the Aron or the

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:43.799
logos okay trust me by the time you're done when somebody says in the beginning

00:54:43.799 --> 00:54:50.240
was the word your mind will go back to the native of the time that they wrote

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:57.240
it this is the power of the words that they have for you you're sitting there do you want this capacity do you want

00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:02.760
this capacity to do this then do exactly exactly what I say hit me hit me with

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:10.359
the next one um look what I wait a minute there's two definite articles here you're gonna say ha or hey why

00:55:10.359 --> 00:55:16.359
would that be because you can have a Theos that's a ha or a hey and the thing

00:55:16.359 --> 00:55:22.839
they're not telling you because this is an introductory intensive course it's

00:55:22.839 --> 00:55:29.160
introductory you'll find out when you get in the bush this is just to train you so you can go out into the bush and

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:34.760
when you're out there in the bush you're going to find that not everything holds

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:41.480
together you we're going to study 2,000 years of Greek and things

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:48.160
change and you got to know in early Greek an archaic homeric Greek and I'm

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:55.400
not talking about a proposed language because we have it it survives because

00:55:55.400 --> 00:56:01.720
it dominates the mind the bakic Empire The Mind was

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:08.559
everything and there was no language not even Latin could stand it right the

00:56:08.559 --> 00:56:16.240
Romans walking around saying we conquered them and they came back with that language and they conquered

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:22.799
us power of Greek do you know what you do to your enemies when all you've got

00:56:22.799 --> 00:56:28.280
is arguments you demonize them there is a

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:35.520
movement of people who will meet the exception of the science and they will

know what is not classical yeah you know what is not classical

01:06:52.839 --> 01:06:58.400
greed it's constantly constantly when Jesus came along and he said it was the

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:04.480
root of all evil he said the love that that desire for profit in Greek the word

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:09.599
is the desire for profit it's not you it's translated the love of money it's

01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:17.680
not it's the drive for profit for making profit making over what you need to

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:22.359
survive is called

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:30.520
greed and what happens The Muse doesn't like greed hates

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:36.119
greed evaporates in the presence of greed it's a part of The Pact with the

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:43.480
devil people we need this esoteric knowledge and in order to acquire it you

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:58.760
Hellenism that is one of the ideas it's not the idea of annihilation and

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:05.520

gotten a black eye um Carl Marx spoke a no stop it purple stop it I'm glad you

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.278
brought up this point Karl Marx did not speak ancient Greek Carl Mark was a

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:57.440
classicist he studied and translated ancient Greek

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:04.560
yeah that's what we have to do we're not here to speak ancient Greek because when you say he spoke ancient Greek what

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.798
you're doing is you're making ancient Greek a modern Greek you are making it a

01:09:09.799 --> 01:09:16.080
language that is a spoken language you're making it an active process and

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:22.440
that is not how you learn a language that is no longer an active

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:29.719
language you have to draw that distinction you don't go in learning to speak it you go in learning to translate

01:09:29.719 --> 01:09:36.080
it your mind crawls into bed with these gorgeous Concepts now purple I know where you were going Carl marks what's

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:41.719
that way I don't know that what is that does anybody know what that means does I don't know what that

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:46.960
means yeah I'm French

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:57.520

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:53.320
with a Frenchman his wine he was he was dressed in his got his big boots on um

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:59.840

says Hey try this try this lovely and it was like metallic mushroom dirt it felt

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:14.960
like I was being energized by some kind of M maternal maternal sauce of the

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:22.159
cosmos oh God no don't underestimate the classical wisdom that

01:11:22.159 --> 01:11:32.120
lies buried in French cult culture it's gorgeous absolutely

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:37.679
gorgeous makes me envious thank you purple good comment go

01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:43.920
to the go to the next one I want to keep us on task here tonight watch people here's a couple of sentences now we've

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.760
learned nouns and I threw up a couple of verbs there to you now we're just going to put it together and I want to show

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:56.280
you how to do this the first word ha there's your definite article the' hos

01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:03.520
that's our word Homer H homos Homer Homer what jump all the way to the end

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:10.600
there's the verb P Homer teaches ton anthrop the

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:19.520
man Homer teaches the person look at me I did it oh you're not supposed to do

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:26.120
that you love it you love it Homer teaches the person

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:32.719
watch now how do I know this isn't the person teaches Homer because Homer is in the nominative case with that ending o

01:12:32.719 --> 01:12:39.719
it's a nominative case he's got to be the subject ton anthron is in the accusative

01:12:39.719 --> 01:12:46.480
case how did I know that if I knew my definite articles it would be obvious we've got to know our definite articles

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:55.280
then right that's just the next thing we got to do um so Homer teaches the man

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.920
what about the one underneath that now watch what happens to

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:10.480
Homer hu look it switched its ending from a nominative to a genitive and what is the

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:17.520
hall going with it the hall is a nominative case as well so it can't be accompanying the hu because that's

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:26.080
genitive would have to be two so what is the hall accompanying it's accompanying

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.320
adelos the brother hu of Homer do you

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:39.400
remember I want you to translate genitives of somebody it's possession of somebody so the subject is adelos

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:45.600
brother H is in the genitive case of Homer the brother of Homer what does the

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:51.920
brother of Homer do by their way he educates who's he educate ton anthron

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:59.719
nice accusative case there you see the accusative ton anthrop Pawn with that on ending on the end of it good it's an

01:13:59.719 --> 01:14:05.159
accusative case it's the object of the verb all right look that's all you need

01:14:05.159 --> 01:14:13.320
to be knowing now what am I doing to you that you don't realize it I'm cramming I'm super or hyper exposing you to the

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:21.719
Greek you're you're being forced to follow and I know there's 80% of you out there are who started from Ground Zero

01:14:21.719 --> 01:14:27.239
are now saying oh I'm I'm just beginning I can kind of all the words I kind of

01:14:27.239 --> 01:14:32.360
follow the letters here all put together right we're running and you're running

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:38.040
with me that's all we're doing give me the next one another two sentences here

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:44.040
look at this hopos now wait a minute where is the

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:49.600
nominative where's the nominative case it's h anthropos you mean the subject is

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.760
at the end of the sentence yes don't let your English mind try to work its itself

01:14:54.760 --> 01:15:00.159
out because we don't put subjects at the end we do subject verb direct object that's

01:15:00.159 --> 01:15:05.760
how we do English right Greek Greek doesn't care about word

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:12.080
order word order is for barbarians word order is for barbarians you know what the Greeks can do they can

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:19.040
take 45 words and throw them up in the air you tell me what that

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:26.280
means well there's no order to yeah there doesn't need to be an order the ending of the words will tell

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:34.199
you what they're doing in the sentence so the subject here is at the end of the sentence H anthropos the the person the

01:15:34.199 --> 01:15:41.679
person does what P teaches ton what is homeon it's an accusative so

01:15:41.679 --> 01:15:49.360
it's the thing it's the thing person or place that's being taught it's being acted upon by the verb the person

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:55.040
teaches Homer what does the bottom line say homos anthropus

01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:01.280
by way where's your subject homos it's got that o nominative ending where's

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.480
your direct object tus anop that's what we're going to be acting on is the men

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:12.600
notice they're in the plural now plural we've got singular and plural nouns dog

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.760
or dogs singular and plural and so how

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:23.199
would you translate that sentence Homer teaches the people Homer teaches the

01:16:23.199 --> 01:16:29.199
people okay now you can go back over these examples and if you do just this

01:16:29.199 --> 01:16:36.920
last 10 minutes of what we've been working on if you do what I want you to do is I want your eyes to track the text

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:43.239
I want your eyes to be able to read it tone Hemet on even if you don't understand it because really what's

01:16:43.239 --> 01:16:48.880
going on with you you're just learning the alphabet you're just at that stage

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:55.560
where you're learning Alpha Beta Gamma Delta that's it right and that's what we're trying to

01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:01.000
do we're trying to reset your mind with the Greek letters look at how beautiful

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:07.840
these things are if I didn't tell you before these are superior to English the English alphabet the Latin alphabet um

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:13.920
that's because I was der elected my duty look at the musicality of this language

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:21.080
look at that P what does that P make you want to do it on the front of P makes me I don't know does something

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:26.480
inside of me with the curves look at the curves on that look at how the top just

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:34.480
kind of coalesces right it kind of just becomes part of the two it's like a bridge P

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:42.280
it's gorgeous I kind of like the Omega too the Omega look at the Omega on anthropus excuse me on anthropos on the

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:48.239
end of the first line look at that Omega do you see how curvaceous that

01:17:48.239 --> 01:17:55.639
Omega is that's musical baby that's musical right there oh God

01:17:55.639 --> 01:18:02.280
yeah love it okay let's stop let's stop with that um give me another one um look

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:10.000
now we're going to get a little more complicated with this first sentence I just want to illustrate one thing look at that third word bio finally we get a

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.800
dative case we've had nominative as a subject genitive as possession or of I

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:21.880
want you to translate it of something of Homer then we've had the accusative

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:27.679
that's the fourth one and it's always a direct object the the one we're leaving out is the dative the dative and what do

01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:34.320
you do with the dative it's the indirect object well what does that mean mayard

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:40.679
um let me tell you what it means you're going to translate it as to for or with you're going to try it every time you

01:18:40.679 --> 01:18:47.760
know what this sentence says with two for or with Homer teaches his brother

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:53.000
the art with books you hear that with

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:59.560
books what is the dative it's a dative of instrument or means it's a dative of

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:06.440
something that gives you the capacity to do something do you need to remember that

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:13.159
when you're translating yeah you do but what do you really need to know what's the cheat just translate those datives

01:19:13.159 --> 01:19:18.440
as two for or with when you're starting out like this two four with a dative is

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:25.280
something beautiful dative is something beautiful and it's got this Yoda in it

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:30.440
Homer teaches the his brother the skill

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:36.400
by means of books with books good that's a double accusative on the end ton

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:43.880
adelon and t double accusative now we sound like nerds right now we sound like

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:50.120
nerds what do you need to take home nominative subject genitive possession

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:55.400
dative to for or with accusative direct object of the ver verb it's what the

01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:01.600
verb's acting on gorgeous give me the next one I'm just going to fly because I'm taking it way too much of these

young boys and girls in their classes chanting off the the Greek

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:28.280
endings you know what they were doing they recognized they were building

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:35.719
Machines of classical civilization so what you're doing you're doing it with a language you're doing it

01:21:35.719 --> 01:21:42.080

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:52.199
here Cicero pull up your Toga what did ciso tell us that nobody

01:22:52.199 --> 01:22:55.880
ever listens to

01:23:00.239 --> 01:23:07.760
right what did you say there in your Latin cisero um repetition is the mother of

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:13.400
learning repetition repetition repetition these are reps what do you

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:19.639
think when you go to the gym what do you think do you stand there and you're like oh I'm not I can't do this I can't look

01:23:19.639 --> 01:23:25.520
it's heavy I can't lift it up well guess what you're going to start rep

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:32.000
and eventually that thing's not going to be heavy you are going to be using your

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:39.400
muscle it's the same thing with the Greek these are the Reps that you have to do right now if I've got 30 students

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:48.040
in front of me in seminary and I'm forcing them to do reps and yes there is something sadistic about it there is but

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:54.480
um there's a point where the student reaches an internalizing of these um endings that

01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:00.280
it it's so satisfactory so satisfactory let's finish up last one what do we have

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:06.320
here finally your definite article people H and to look at look at the

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:12.960
masculine definite articles ha to toy ton don't those look like the endings that we're just seeing Oh they do what

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:19.880
look at the plurals Hoy tone to to all right they look a lot like the

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:26.280
declensional endings so it's not too far of a jump look at the feminine hey taste

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:31.960
Tayan High tone T TOS High tone T toas High tone T TOS right what about the

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:38.520
neuter notice that the new neuter nominative and accusative are the same you mean I don't know in a sentence

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:44.159
whether the neuter is the subject or the object no you have to figure it out you

01:24:44.159 --> 01:24:51.760
have to figure it out now how are you don't not with your brain don't worry but just by the way all of those words

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:58.119
that have been thrown up into the air just by the way way it Glides around you'll see it because what you have to

01:24:58.119 --> 01:25:04.239
learn with Greek that you don't have to learn with English is universal interaction I'm going to tell you that

01:25:04.239 --> 01:25:11.360
now and it's something that I teach to all of my students through the Greek without them even knowing it you're

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:18.239
gonna have to throw up a bunch of Concepts into the air and you're GNA have to be able to see their connections

ancient Greek um what we're doing is we're coming from a step down to a much more

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:58.960
