and let's go let's go forward we've got a little bit of tonight for your viewing

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.020
pleasure I want you to be able to see a little bit of a deposition that took place and I'm gonna warm us up tonight

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:31.020
with that deposition I'm just going to play it again but I want you to think of yourself think of yourself in the top

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.760
floor of downtown Minneapolis building full of legal offices

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.620
and people taking depositions and going here and there looking at that you see

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.819
the whole city from up there right um and that's where we are that's where we are and we are with a

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.060
group of attorneys who are attempting to

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.700
um draw out draw out a uh well you be

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.760
the judge you be the judge what is it they're trying to draw seven hours of questioning hit it Chewie

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.940
obscene in some of the documents Mr Hellman that there is reference to what

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.280
is called a muse correct and sometimes

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.000
it seems in reading some of the documents it's hard to know whether you're the one who is actually speaking

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
or providing information or where the information is coming from a muse

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.400
is that fair let me I'm not quite sure what you're asking tell me about

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.560
[Music] you have amused yes

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.000
what is your Muse or who is your Muse The Muse is a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.540
Divinity that inspires poets she's the voice of inspiration

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.340
in Antiquity she was worshiped does the Muse have a name

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:19.019
there are several of them yeah what are they Cleo is the muse of History so as I

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:28.380
was a graduate student I considered myself her student Medea is a Roman Muse she was the first

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.860
and I consider myself a student of her poetry all of the effects what you say

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.900
or what you do the muses use poetry to inspire

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.139
so as a teacher I consider it my duty and obligation to serve that process of

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:52.800
inspiration poetic inspiration do you hear the news from time to time not

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.740
audibly I read poetry so I hear her speak through the poems

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.080
and do you hear either of your Muses in

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:12.660
your mind from time to time I don't hear anything in my mind that I don't read

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:21.800
from a text as an academic no I don't hear any voices in my head

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:30.539
how is it that the news guide you from day to day well the news is the purpose

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:37.199
of the news was to reveal Beauty and so the servant of the Muse is bound

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.590
to perpetuate that teaching and you yes

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.960
[Music] I would say so yes

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:54.419
then right correct I am just too yeah

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:00.660
well you know I would say that I'm bound to serve it everything that those

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.479
Divinity stood for in antiquity if you say I'm bound to serve Bacchus I

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:13.680
would have to say sure what sparcus it's a who not a what oh

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.460
snap you didn't know Bacchus was the son of simile and he became for the Greeks and some of

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:30.500
the Eastern cultures he became the god of the Vine the god of ecstasy Lord Divine or Vine

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:39.419
Vine like Grapevine he was the god of wine he was the god of

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:45.180
ecstasy so he is betrayed oftentimes

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:55.020
working in concert with the muses teach and to inspire yes I have to say I

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:01.620
am bound to serve him stop me

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.199
it's my duty [Music]

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:12.419
is [Music] n't dirty your first question

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:19.039
try to keep an idea yes in your conceptualization of this

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:26.580
is there more than one dude I think personally it breaks and Romans

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:32.340
established religious ideals and it's every human being's duty to Aspire to

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:41.520
because they reflect things like Beauty and nature Mr Hillman you have some tattoos on both

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.180
sides of your head can you tell me what they represent sure

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.759
would you mind addressing me as Dr Hillman

00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:01.380
and I'll bring you more later it gets to Crescendo and you wonder you remember

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:07.199
while you're watching this these little clips that this is a transcript of an

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:14.780
actual event so um it's very interesting to watch to see what people you know um you could put

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:22.080
1339 on it and people would not know the difference yeah fantastic you didn't

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:29.460
think it was relevant but back then when it was attacking education before it attacked the

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:37.440
government it attacked us first Ryan we had mobs and book burnings

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:45.959
for everybody else they just warmed up right yeah you cannot remember the

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:51.240
goddess Justice is the last to leave she's the last to leave you have one

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:59.760
hope keep Justice or lose your democracy keep Justice nobody is above her nobody

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:07.980
is above her fantastic let's go Jump Right In I want us to uh I had a couple

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:14.040
of comments there for people to maybe just go ahead and run one of those one or two of those comments Chewie let's

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:54.779
of people molested and raped or you know mentally raped and molested yeah yeah

00:09:54.779 --> 00:10:00.600

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:14.640
yes look at this help me out here what is the alternate explanation that defends the church give for uh what went

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.800
on during all of these initiations and ceremonies now this is absolutely wild

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.200
I'm having a hard time imagining what defensive narrative they would offer or

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.720
offer yeah remember that that was great comment yeah

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:37.260
um remember that we are in a time where uh mystery religions are performing

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:42.480
rights that are involving sex and drugs and there's a lot of people getting

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.240
busted for a lot of stuff right not the drugs right Romans don't care about the

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:56.640
drugs the Romans don't care about the drugs why am I talking about this because our spaceship has reached the

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:03.600
time that we needed to reach and here we are first century right here we are oh

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.860

seeing if he will well well what are they doing well he's been in and out

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:18.900
he's been saying things and screaming about being thirsty yeah and he's been saying stuff

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.600
so he said something that tipped us off and what was that thing that he said

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:30.900
let's go there let's go there look everybody back in the ship we're going back by two minutes okay go ahead get us

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:36.179
there Chewie lightspeed nope next one

00:20:36.179 --> 00:20:42.380
there we go and uh this is what Jesus is doing at the time what was that

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:48.179
Son of God would you please pick up for me and Jesus

00:20:48.179 --> 00:20:53.360
let out this great voice

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:59.360
and breathe out his breath for the last

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:08.160
he X pneumaticized yeah he took out his breath this is the

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:16.080
way people have a saying to die in Antiquity right the breath is the life

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.600
what that pneuma you don't have januma anymore you don't have life

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:28.440
that's the way it is yeah love it lovely imagery they've got now but he he breathes down his line

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.780
okay so there is people he's dead he's dead on the cross

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:40.380
there's a problem he's early nobody else is dead

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:47.340
the two people that he's hanging between those people aren't dead why because this is not how you die from

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:53.340
crucifixion you die from crucifixion by suffocating yeah

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:59.760
so when it came time when it came time we've got some problems with the guards

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:05.159
they're telling us Jesus died prematurely it's now at this point when

00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:11.640
he breathes out that last air okay two minutes ago what did he just say that

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:18.659
these these people were making a joke about him hallucinating I want to see

00:22:18.659 --> 00:22:24.059
what was he saying take us back no one more

00:22:24.059 --> 00:22:31.500
there we go yeah and in the ninth hour he shouted at Boyson you know what this

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:38.220
is not this is not the behavior of somebody who's dying from loss of blood it's not

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:44.159
he shouted out Jesus in this great voice he's got the guy's got some pipes on him

00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:49.799
right and he's he's bellowing out foreign

00:22:59.059 --> 00:23:05.400
this must be the sacred language of the Angels

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:11.460
um if you would stop just for a second those of you who are my students go ahead and put it back up with you see

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:16.860
the words that you get here I want you to tell you and Louis Ellery that Lambda

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:24.059
is oftentimes a representative of a Dye gamma right you'll get it the people up

00:23:24.059 --> 00:23:32.580
the stream they couldn't pronounce it the same way so what do we have here we have ewe we have the shout that is given

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:40.260
to Bacchus and what do we have in sabakthane we've got two Gods we've got

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:48.179
Samba and we've got Saba in his sonian version written large do you know what

00:23:48.179 --> 00:23:55.080
this is this is the shout of a bakunt who is performing the mystery take it

00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:01.580
down what is crazy is that he got himself killed

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:10.080
while performing the mystery itself he was supposed to enter into death and

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:17.400
then come out in Resurrection but his boy got clipped and he ended up dazed on

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:26.640
a cross screaming out bockick imprecations to the God and they go on

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:33.720
in that verse it goes on in that verse and talks about

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:41.400
it yeah what we interpret this to mean why

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:47.760
because it wasn't a language it was a magical expression

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:55.440
from the walks magikai right the war case Magica excuse me the voice says

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.480
plural the magic voices good

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.520
all right do you see how we're are we getting this okay we've got him we've

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:12.840
got him screaming I'm thirsty I'm thirsty right we've got him long story short he gets poked in the side right

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:19.860
because the soldiers come out why do they come out to break people's legs and why why are they breaking people's legs

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:27.360
go ahead and bring out the next Greek yeah so the soldiers come out right they came out and what happened they broke

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:34.340
they smashed the legs of the first guy Ryan like they're using some kind of

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:41.100
hammer right and and then what they did while they smashed the legs of the other

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:47.580
guy the ones that were crucified with him

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:54.659
okay so you've got to see this is all because people didn't want the view for

00:25:54.659 --> 00:26:01.260
the holiday that was coming up to be a bunch of dudes on crosses

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:07.380
who wants that when Grandma comes with all of her presents I don't right

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:12.720
so what did they do they took they took down Jesus [Music]

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:17.760
right that's what the text tells us

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.940
and how are they going to take him down well he's got to be dead right just finish the execution you know how the

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:29.279
Romans finish your crucifixion Jesus hold your ears this might be painful

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:36.419
I'm not talking Mel Gibson painful right I'm not talking three hours of the most

00:26:36.419 --> 00:26:45.120
delightful gruesome sadistic stuff that I've ever seen invented I mean this Mel

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:52.260
Gibson and the Marquis de sad are right in the same place those guys those guys

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:59.520
would get along you know what I mean same level you and me Mel you and me

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:06.120
yeah decide it's amazing so um let's get back to the actual crucifixion Jesus

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:13.260
close yours so they get to the to Jesus and of course as we just saw he's

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:20.159
already dead he's already dead and that's when one of the guys yells

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:25.799
out yeah he was the son of God do you know why

00:27:25.799 --> 00:27:30.799
you can follow the fairy tale and you will

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:40.159
oh behold the son of God

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:47.159
right that's the fairy tale the other side is the sons of God like the baptized

00:27:47.159 --> 00:27:55.640
right we're a group of people associated with a drug and sex ritual

00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.779
fantastic sons of God you know what they did

00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:09.659
yeah yeah they got together with the ladies the ladies like Mary Magdalene

00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:15.720
did you guys know the sons of God they didn't know the sons of God I can't believe this

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:23.460
I can't believe this they were with Mary and her crew right Jesus is always hanging around

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:30.140
with what group he's not hanging around with the wealthy

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:36.720
he's not hanging around with the um business people

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:42.480
now he's hanging around with the prostitutes and the accountants

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:49.620
yeah fantastic okay so within the circles he's able to do the right

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:54.320
so much so that he gets himself caught

00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:00.980
so imagine this you are being crucified

00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:07.340
while you are under the influence of drugs

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:14.120
drugs that are balanced with a sexual act between you and a child

00:29:14.539 --> 00:29:20.760
you have freaked out because they have found you and you have your hands raised

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:26.279
up and you say I am not a child trafficker and you know what they do

00:29:26.279 --> 00:29:35.460
they get a mob up that's pissed and they crucify three child traffickers together

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:41.940
do you know what the text tells us sells it tells us on let's show it show the show the people because don't take my

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:49.260

where the hanging on his right hand on his left or on his right hand and on the one that

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:07.860
we don't say bad things about right because we all know it's the Sinister one but you know that's how they said

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:13.200
left isn't that funny yeah right okay take it down does

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:20.340

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:39.200
good day Alan I was just reading diadors when I Came Upon This in book five

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:46.820
Laguna isn't that a nice word filo Guna that's the word to love

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:52.919
that's the word to love and the word for woman

00:30:52.919 --> 00:30:59.940
together in the same word look at that the Greeks have a word for

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:06.779
woman lover woman lover yeah are you one of those women lovers

00:31:06.779 --> 00:31:12.240

have so much love for their women they love their women more than anybody does

00:31:18.419 --> 00:31:25.580

they'll trade four men for one of their

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:37.440
own females back that's how much they love women they'll trade four do you know why this

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:42.899
tribe did that because they understood the resource

00:31:42.899 --> 00:31:49.020

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:13.500
um 1200 years before the masculine savior that took over and monopolized

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:20.279
the system did you know it was started by a woman yeah does that surprise you

00:32:20.279 --> 00:32:25.620
yeah does it surprise you that she could get all the way over into Italy we call

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:30.960

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.820
Abduction of Cora and look to see how harparge and harpazzo excuse me were

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:51.839
translated in the English Bible right it was watered down to robbery or plundering even though it's described as

00:34:51.839 --> 00:35:00.359
rape everywhere else enjoy your day thanks great great input right so you see how

00:35:00.359 --> 00:35:05.640
somebody can step forward and they did from the last time that we met

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:11.460
and said that boy who is with him who is not a boy

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:17.160
he's a full-grown naked man wrapped in bandaged

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:25.020
just on his Goombas though yeah those people said look he's just

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:31.320
saying I had a lot of indignation for those of you evangelicals who wrote back thank you for writing back please keep

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:38.460
it up I enjoy it and I think it's a good forum but when you write back to me and you

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:46.140
say it it means robber I know right away that you don't do Greek number one and that's what this

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:52.500
student was showing you right this student just came along and said hey there's look I found another

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:58.320
context here where it talks about abduction it's not it's rape the history

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:04.760
of the world starts through Herodotus with abduction

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:12.599
rape you can call it child trafficking taking a young girl off to be the Bride

00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:18.000
of some King it all starts with four of them one of

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:28.079
them is Medea yeah wow wow and Jesus runs I'm not a pirate I'm

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:34.500
not one of these you know why because he knew what those Roman soldiers can do right

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:43.140
wow walk up with a sledgehammer and turn your legs into pulp so you suffocate

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:49.020
we'd be done with this and everybody can be home look we got another Son of God up there

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:55.740
right and Jesus freaking out saying ah and well you can follow the fairy tale

00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:02.579
and say it was at this moment kitties that the sins of the world were being

00:37:02.579 --> 00:37:10.440
placed upon him and he's saying why'd you turn against me right why'd you tongue is me can you
