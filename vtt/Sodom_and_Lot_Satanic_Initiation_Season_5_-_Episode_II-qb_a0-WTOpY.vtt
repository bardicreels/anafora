I know people have been asking me when are we going to song today's that day but I say so with a

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.060
heavy heart I say so with a heavy heart because we're going to have to look at things

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:35.280
that are disturbing and confused at the same time disturbing and confused you

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.000
haven't perception that is a translation based upon a translation of the initial

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.759
account tonight we're going to that initial account

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:54.300
we're in Hellenistic Alexandria we've got access to the library

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.360
and tonight we're going in to look at what is there in the Greek in the Greek

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.740
I'm going to set this with a series of vignettes

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:15.360
that I hope will put you in the place that you can see how the greed

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.580
drives Sodom and Gomorrah

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.460
yes it's our grade that drives it

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.699
the way that we see it the hallucination that you and I are under about Sodom and

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:38.820
Gomorrah let's dispel it let's get down to the dirty and see what it is but in

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.400
order to do so let's set ourselves with a video Chewie you got the star charts

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.820
hit it we may preserve the seed of our father they made their father drink wine that

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.240
night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she laid down nor when she arose

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.380
around here to lie with us as is the custom all over the Earth

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.080
who drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.960
and it was there that something disastrous happened lot's daughters got him drunk and slept

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.120
with him resulting in an incestuous pregnancies so one night the oldest

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.120
daughter decided to get her father drunk walk to the point that he was unaware of his surroundings

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:34.259
one slot was in this incapacitated State she proceeded to have sex with him that's impregnated another drunk and

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:41.060
having sex with him their acts of incest show sodom's influence on them

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.768
[Music]

00:06:52.199 --> 00:07:00.660
now many of you know the long-term implications of this relationship between lot and his daughters if you can

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:06.180
call it that and you know that it started out with a very strange visit

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.740
by a couple of Coolio curio

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.280

talks about nymphs yes it does it talks about menad women too

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:28.080
yes it does all of this in this work that has been pasted and plastered over

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:34.080
with medieval Hebrew to give it an appearance of something it is not we

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.720
have to strip away that Lair the King James is going to have all the errors and everything after it's going to

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:46.080
follow him because they're following that tradition we're looking at the Greek let's see what these girls do can

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.180

in the city of segor okay so he camped out in a cave he and

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.279

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:14.300
some kind of expulsion they made their daddy explode his seed

how does he manage to be unconscious and yet to ejaculate

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:44.820
and you say wait I didn't know he's unconscious yeah they're about to say it right he didn't get anything

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:53.540
right he didn't perceive either her laying on him

00:15:53.540 --> 00:16:00.660
or his explosion and you have to ask yourself he's reaping I should call it

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:07.620
and you have to ask yourself how did he not how is he not aware of this

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:13.440
how is the her sister comes in a little bit she's like we I was successful and

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.740
her sister comes in and does the same thing and both of them get pregnant so

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:25.680
the question is we've got a dude old dude couple of girls

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:31.800
they're both pregnant don't worry they're both virgins that's what they said

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:38.339
what's gonna happen right what's gonna happen to the situation here officer I

00:16:38.339 --> 00:16:44.160
don't don't did you have a warrant right for the cave do you have to get a

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:49.320
warrant for a cave my goodness where is transdimensional

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:56.940
Child Protective Services this is getting gross what's interesting about it as a case

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:04.980
though in history what's interesting is that she's able to collect him

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:11.040
in a semi-conscious or unconscious state

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:16.980
where he is amnestic he is amnestic he cannot remember what

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:22.319
just happened he could be passed out drunk we're at a

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:28.620
crime scene people the girl's father was passed out drunk how did they collect

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:34.679
his semen you cannot collect semen

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:39.780
while a person is passed out unless

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:49.279
unless you've given them a drug to make them a Seder

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:57.179
funny thing is that's Tyrion that drug and antiquity

00:17:57.179 --> 00:18:04.100
that's making such a splash with the sources that drug in antiquity

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:12.000
also induces amnesia Oh you mean you can take Scopolamine and

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.520
atropine and all these other Belladonna derived drugs you can put them into a

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:24.240
person and you can create a psychological whole yes

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:30.480
yes experiential brain holes yeah

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.940
uh-huh chemical what do you think anesthesia is

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:41.280
yeah yeah fantastic you know our chemistry is all

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:47.820
from those plants right it's where we're getting it all the Romans are using it because they know you don't want a

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:54.720
patient when you're doing something serious like amputation or something you don't you don't want a patient

00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:00.299
um to have to experience that trauma right so if you've got the anesthetics

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:05.880
you give them to them this one will help them to forget this one will help them not have pain this one will help to put

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:13.980
him to sleep it's all plant chemistry yeah love it love it love it love it you

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:20.640
thought that the only thing there was the THC right that's what you thought right yeah no there's a whole universe

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:29.039
of stuff in those things right we better start walking around sampling different Shrubbery if we want

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:37.860
to recapture Antiquity because they were way ahead of us way ahead of us on all of this plant okay so

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:45.120
um it's the terminology and the Greek the long and short is the terminology in the Greek is so specific that she is

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.160
taking that from him that he's got to have an erection lot's got to be erect

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.500
which you know doesn't happen when you pass out dead drunk right so

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:02.760
um what about these drugs let's go see let's go back to the beginning of the chapter now and

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:09.299
try to take a look at what's the what's the environment like that these girls are being raised in that you know

00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:16.380
they're acting this kind of way um let's see let's see it's fantastic fantastic background before we do I want

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:23.700
to hit that video again and I want you to take a look take a look at the uh imagery the

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:29.760
imagery that did it and helped me match it up to the next text that we look at go ahead to it we may preserve the seed

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:35.160
of our father they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:41.400
with her father and he perceived not when she laid down nor when she arose there's no man around here to lie with

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:47.460
us as is the custom all over the Earth drink wine

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:53.880
and then lie with him and preserve our hearts and it was there that something

00:20:53.880 --> 00:21:01.140
disastrous happened Lots daughters got him drunk and slept with him resulting in an incestuous

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:08.039
pregnancies so one night the oldest daughter decided to get her father drunk walk to the point that he was unaware of

00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:15.799
his surroundings one slot was in this incapacitated State she proceeded to have sex with him

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:21.660
drunk and having sex with him their acts of incest show saddam's influence on

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:27.900
them foreign

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:34.500
[Music]

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:42.679
the fairy tale is far less interesting than the reality right the reality is

00:21:42.679 --> 00:21:49.679
what Hosea look at this I'm quoting prophets people you know rule number one

00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:56.159
with the devil read your Bible read your Bible read it and there's this

00:21:56.159 --> 00:22:03.059
quote that I wanted to give you from Hosea it's just three words here here give a give a Christian a tickle oh

00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:09.240
there we go I love it can you feel it with my hands I can feel it okay

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.240
foreign

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.919
maniacs oyster Maniacs what are oyster Maniacs

00:22:28.919 --> 00:22:39.000
they're the ones who are entering via the burning purple this is an arrow poison people this is an aeropoison

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:46.500
fire the burning purple you too can have the flux in your eyes you do can enter

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:52.980
into that place yeah you can see you can have your eyes

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:59.039
opened yeah Hosea doesn't like it

00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:04.080
because that is causing people to revolt

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.120
against curios wow okay so you see some of the politics

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.280
right but in the world that we're looking at these

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.860
things are not unusual putting yourself into a state of mania is not an unusual

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.960
thing there's that dozen different religions you can join if you want to do

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.000
just that okay fantastic let's go let's go back to

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
the text I want to bring you this from the beginning yep now I'm just going to read this one blow this one up thanks

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.159
Julie by the way everybody who's saying Chewie is doing such a fantastic job on her videos thank you so much from Chewie

yup shout out to Chewie for having done such a wonderful job Anthony look I'm

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:58.559
just gonna translate it's just turn on translator right okay so two Messengers came to Sodom about the time the sun was

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:05.100
going down and lot was sitting at the Gate of Sodom so seeing the messengers

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:12.000
he got up and he went over for a meeting and he prostrated himself he got down on

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.480
one knee before uh uh with his face toward the ground right he's giving him

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:24.600
a sign of a sign of respect and he said to them hey they're Lords wait that's

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:32.940
not kind of yeah that's he says hey there Lords Lords right cleaner to take a detour to

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:38.940
my place now be your boy be a boy that's what he says that's

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:46.200
colloquial Greek for I'll be your servant you know whatever you want I'll give you

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.240
come into my house so he uh he says look just take off your

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:56.940
stuff wash your feet and get up in the morning and take off on your own way

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:02.960
literally says on your own way but they said

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:10.220
no well we think not bro Ryan we're going to stay on the street tonight

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:18.480
they're gonna camp in the street right lot knows this is Sodom do you

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:26.760
feel the fear you have been falsely you've been lied to about this place Sodom you do not live in Disneyland this

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:32.480
is the reality everywhere is Sodom verse number three

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.640
so you know he got a little bit physical with them you know just directed him on as he beat him up she says he got a

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:46.679
little forceful and he directed him to his house so they came to his house right and he made them a proton he made

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:52.380
them what he made them a proton now in the King James you'll see this this

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:59.039
translated as meal and in the Hebrew is Twisted but in the Greek into the meal but in

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:06.600
the Greek it doesn't say that and all of a sudden it now makes sense a proton is something you drink at a big

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:13.919
banquet to get smashed it is something that you create to give to somebody to put them to sleep you

00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:19.380
know what the doctors do and this is you classes out there you are terrible

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:25.559
because you don't read The Physicians you know what the Physicians do they can make these things for you

00:26:25.559 --> 00:26:31.080
right they're compounds compound drinks and they have a base you know typically

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:38.940
wine but it's because that's alcohol in it they've got other bases right so what

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:44.039
what do you do you make somebody a potent you know who makes people photos

00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:51.539
right you know who makes people potions witches make people potions and you know

00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:58.260
where to go if you can't get an erection in Antiquity if you can't get an

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:03.900
erection in Antiquity you go to a witch she'll make you a potion that will give

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:09.919
you one that's just life right drug stores with

00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:17.159
medical stuff that's all lovely lovely love it so what does he do

00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:22.559
lots making these guys a potion it doesn't say he's making a night calf it

00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:27.720
doesn't say he's making him something to make their tummies nice while they're good he's making them a potion

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:34.740
and they start to go to sleep but before they drop off to sleep before they drop off to sleep what

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:40.559
happens the city surrounds them dude the city surrounds them

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:45.840
right before he could drop off this is verse four

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:53.360
um the men of the city of Sodom they surround them they make a circle around the house from the neonisco to the

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:59.039
presbyteru that presbytero's the oldest the neoniscos is the youngest do you

00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:05.760
like that those of you who know Praise His Name Jesus Christ was arrested in a

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.460
public park with the naked naniscos

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:16.740
he was 35 and he wasn't naked he was

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:21.900
wearing underwear okay

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:30.120
okay well if you actually read Greek and this is Good's third Century second century

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:35.220
you know Greek it's a Hellenistic kind

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:42.659
of about jumping into that stream of coin a but still very very very didactic

00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:51.419
kind of Greek still has a tinge of that attic elevation if you will can you smell it

00:28:51.419 --> 00:28:57.480
whenever you smell attic it smells like a saddle smells like a horse's leather

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:04.980
saddle very peculiar combination you lean in love that stuff oh yeah but this

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:12.120
is you know this is a little bit more utilitarian so what what do we have here we have the

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:19.200
old men let's go back to the text we had the old men and the boys right this is a crowd that goes from the from the old

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.600
men to the boys yeah and um they're acting together as a group but I'm just

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:30.059
going to translate it yeah yeah yeah and they call out to lot and said hey he

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:37.919
said hey where are these dudes that came to you tonight bring them out

00:29:37.919 --> 00:29:44.279
so that we may I can't say it

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:51.120
without getting myself in trouble but if I were to translate this

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:56.399
if I were to translate this using my Greek dirty language translator it would

00:29:56.399 --> 00:30:03.059
be a word that begins with F yes yes okay

00:30:03.059 --> 00:30:08.520
yes so that you may what them how many words this is another word this

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:15.960
is soon gignoma right this is really to be with and in the sense of in the sense

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:22.860
of you bringing uh bringing these two things together yeah you can be born with somebody too

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:28.919
isn't it weird they looked at twins being born the same as having intercourse

00:30:28.919 --> 00:30:35.820
huh be together yeah to become together

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:41.940
and then they've got another sex verb coming up which means to know to know

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:48.179
I know you right right it's a little bit

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:53.399
in your face ninth but it's that idea of complete and

00:30:53.399 --> 00:31:00.539
total knowledge you know everything lies we've known together

00:31:00.539 --> 00:31:06.600
the uh King James people like to rely on this

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:14.820
um thank you to Scholars like Jeffrey Henderson who write books about the dirty the dirty language in Greek his

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:20.460
first book about dirty language Harvard shout out to all the morons at Harvard

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:26.399
um his first book about it was about dirty language and attic comedy he took

00:31:26.399 --> 00:31:36.360
it to the to Harvard press and they said new new oh see yes it was too rough for

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:43.320
their palettes but he got published anyway

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:49.620
eventually right some things are sensitive right and they end up he didn't even

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:56.039
make it to the book burning he just didn't didn't get through the door without going around doing a run around

00:31:56.039 --> 00:32:01.080
the academics so the dirty language is very specific and I have students that

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:07.559
I'm working with now that we discuss and look through his work on dirty language

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:15.059
and it's so more so much more sophisticated and great so much there's

00:32:15.059 --> 00:32:20.940
nuances just smells little odors little bouquets of every little every little

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:27.000
naughty word has a little bokeh a little pink piggy oh smell that

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.720
smell that so um this is disturbing are you finding it

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:39.779
disturbing let's go back to the text let's get them let's get them out they've got to see why that we came or

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:45.240
this is not I'm gonna be productive okay everybody let's go really quick uh lead

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:51.360
them out to us you know you know so he goes out lot goes out and he's standing on the porch you know he closes the door

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:57.539
right so that they can't get in and he says look guys don't do this don't mistreat these men you know what does he

00:32:57.539 --> 00:33:05.159
say verse 8 and this is perhaps the most interesting verse in the Bible which will show you that you really don't

00:33:05.159 --> 00:33:11.340
understand what's going on verse 8 acides

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:19.019
uh look I have two daughters and um they haven't had sex with a dude

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:27.420
yeah um how about I bring them out to you and you enjoy them as you deem appropriate

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:34.799
[Music] and you ask yourself

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:39.840
what what wait

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:45.059
he goes on to say just don't violate these men right right

00:33:45.059 --> 00:33:51.179
or before he says don't violate these men that's why they came under my protection here are my daughters

00:33:51.179 --> 00:33:56.760
here are my daughters what is going on these are girls who are virgins

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:04.760
they're gonna go out what do you think they're gonna do what do you think they're gonna do in Sodom and Gomorrah

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:11.158
where they have the drugs to turn you into a Seder where they have the rights

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:16.740
to initiate you into a world of death and bring you back

00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:24.240
you know what that Resurrection is it's the same concept of bringing out the

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:30.800
seed bringing out Lots seed

00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:38.598
when you have dead Osiris with just a phallus

00:34:39.379 --> 00:34:46.800
there are drugs you can use bring out that seed there are drugs you

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:52.800
can use yeah this is nothing new what you see once you're smelling that

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:59.580
are confusing to us are these hints these whiffs

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:06.720
of this old religion that is really a part of the culture and

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:13.380
you can't detect that it's like radiation so when you're reading the Bible if you don't have a radiation

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:18.140
detector you really have no context

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:28.020
and that's why it really isn't all that odd that he offered his daughters

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:35.099
to the city they get really mad and they say look you don't realize that you're a

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:40.920
dude who moved here and we're natives so you know what we're going to do we're

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:49.380
going to do to you what we were going to do to them and then the Angels come in take a blot

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:55.560
and say you better get your people get out of town this is before he had sex with his

00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:01.140
daughters you better get your people and get out of town right but he didn't know any of

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:08.579
it he didn't see any other they're making potions they're making potions people and the

00:36:08.579 --> 00:36:15.078
pharmacological golden age is the late Bronze Age

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:23.540
it is the late Bronze Age Okay so

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:31.099
just so you understand the draw of the text

00:36:31.099 --> 00:36:37.560
realize that these people are doing things that in the context of their

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.900
civilizations or accepted and normal okay

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:48.720
okay for them to collect their father semen

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.780
is not just to Randy girls

00:36:53.780 --> 00:37:02.300
being naughty this is more than some kind of incestuous fun time

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:08.480
they have the skill take a man who is

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:14.400
unconscious and bring his bring his semen

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:20.520
out so that they can impregnate themselves

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:25.800
what kind of how much knowledge do you have to have

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:33.359
in order to affect this kind of an outcome a serious amount and it only makes sense it only makes sense that

00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:39.060
Lots daughters would have a serious amount of information Abram wait that's

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:46.140
what they call Abram all right there's no Pig in Abraham

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:53.480
Abram [Music] and what he does he wakes up in the morning right this is a very powerful

00:37:53.480 --> 00:38:00.060
very powerful late Bronze Age figure and he gets up what does he do eight Nutley

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:07.619
bronzer he's a little bit earlier than that but Bronze Age Bronze Age and he gets up and he's

00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:16.140
looking out he's looking out what's going on because he goes to a meeting with curios he goes to Big you know who

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:23.160
big Yahoo and he's standing there with him with the guy whose name doesn't exist or on is what they call them the

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:28.339

there he is I told you they were oyster Maniacs I know some oyster Maniacs in Israel today

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:41.640
they were telling that Abraham's like standing there with God right he's like dude you see what's

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:49.320
going on you see what's going on he looks off the distance and he sees this Vapor this

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:56.280
vapor and it's a word that is so specific there is no word for it in Hebrew so the Hebrew fudges it and says

00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:04.940
smoke but the problem is the smoke reappears in a different form coming later and they have to repeat the word

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:10.920
oh they did such a terrible job here's the message I'm sending I'm gonna send a

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:18.480
message I'm gonna send a message to the masoretic sect in the 10th Century oh no

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:25.800
Domini you guys are terrible at what you do you're terrible

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:31.020
leave the Greek alone okay that's all I can sustain

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:37.320
foreign yeah and it's this simple and logical

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.660
and we have the text right in front of us but we are surrounded by the prison

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:48.960
cell that is the fake narrative the fairy

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:54.480
tale of the last 2 000 years of historical

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.880
detritus yeah this is Flotsam and Jetsam it's

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:04.700
built up over time

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:14.700
and that's what that's what we don't need that's obscuring that text this

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:22.560
text about Lots daughters is a lot more sophisticated than you think and these people are a lot more intelligent than

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:29.099
you can look back on and say oh weren't they primitive weren't they let me tell you something they knew more about drugs

00:40:29.099 --> 00:40:36.119

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:51.720
that's what it was pharmacological Renaissance what you've seen tonight is disturbing

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:57.780
but it's much more disturbing from the angle of why didn't we learn this

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:06.119
earlier right why do we have such a distorted perception of these texts

00:41:06.119 --> 00:41:13.200
