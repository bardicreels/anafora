00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.860
second so this is our opening this is our opening passage this is our Bible

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.379
passage it's the famous John 3 16 that you see at every football game held up

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:49.580
on the sign and I just want you to notice that

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.739
God loves the world and gave his monogenes

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.760
his mono Guinness she would bring us back up the passage again I want you to look at look at the word mono Guinness

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.099
it's on the second line second line and it's the third word in

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.120
the form here yeah because it's an accusative those of you in class

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.879
excellent um but I want you to look at that word and I want you to remember that word

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:28.920
what is the only begotten what is the only begotten of God what is it there

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.500
are those people out there who believe Christianity they are believers and they

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.760
believe Christianity came ex-nihilo in the first century just poof it was there

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.519
on the scene and for those of us who study reason and don't have the belief

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.159
we know that this does not happen that there there is not a religious framework

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.159
that is born complete without having built upon the terminology of its

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.879
predecessors remember Judaism and Christianity are Bronze Age

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.400
saturnian offshoots I shoot

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:55.259
foreign great you'll have to pardon me we're having a terrible internet night tonight

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:01.199
here at the base of the Colorado Rockies um it's exciting but it's a little bit

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:07.500
annoying hopefully we'll be okay I'll be back if I have to disappear for moments

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.080
um Chewie hit the first verse from the hymn to Athena because we're looking for

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.780
this mono Guinness and I want you all to take a look at this take a look at this Palace

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:32.280
and we look at that second word and we see that it's the monarchinace now dialectical differences play with vowels

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:39.000
so that's why we get the moo in the front of the Moon okay instead of the monarchyness but don't worry it's just

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.820
the difference between something like attic and ionian yeah two different dialects fantastic the only born the

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.840
only born right Palace the only born who is Palace this is Athena we are invoking

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:02.820
tonight we're in Attica tonight we are in the Dem where we worship the naked

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:10.560
version and in this team we call her Palace and that word Palace people are so terrible

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:19.940
with this word um it's the the origin of it it's beautiful um The Palace is that Korra is that

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:26.479
pre-developed Korah who carries the spear who carries the spirit that

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:35.160
pre-adolescent core that carries a spear and you say wait a minute who is this that you're talking about this is the

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.280
girl whom we release from the head of Zeus

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.780
we we take the acts of Hephaestus and we

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.180
slice open Jehovah's head and from Jehovah's head

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:59.100
Springs the new ruler who possesses all that belongs to Jehovah

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.940
this is her and she is the Palace of the Romans

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:12.259
absorb the concept with pilex and it's the image of the girl who is not yet

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:17.340
marriageable and how do they she's not in a thief yet right she's not

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:25.199
marriageable so she's premarital she's not developed hence the virgin

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:32.220
and why we protect her because she is not yet marriageable she is in that

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:40.759
state now wait a minute she's burst from the head of Zeus and when she does she makes both Mortals and Immortals Quake

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:48.440
shake the images of shaking the images of what you feel when you get hit by the

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.520
by the wave of sound that hits you when Thunder

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:59.639
is is there Thunderstruck this is Thunderstruck that fear that paralyzes

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:06.840
you in place that is what the palace brings to you and you say how can this

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:14.460
Palace this mono Guinness this child of God how can this child of God which was

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:21.180
originally a daughter of God how can this daughter bring complete

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:29.099
quaking and shaking in us she is the one who emerges she is the one who emerges

00:08:29.099 --> 00:08:36.839
from the head yes she is that daughter of matis she is

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:43.260
that daughter of that reasoning she is the daughter of that intellect

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:50.040
yes and she comes into the world in that form and you say this is not scary this

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:56.880
is not scary to me I don't see remember his daughter this 12 year old is

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.040
actually six foot tall and carries a a

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:07.980
spear and exercises naked we'll see this we'll see this and how can she do that

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:15.899
remember where you are remember where you are you are in a song you are in a song that is being sung

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:21.959
during a mystery performance the images that you are receiving you are receiving

00:09:21.959 --> 00:09:27.360
from the throne you are seated upon the throne of Saturn

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:34.560
receiving these images how is it scary remember she's six foot

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:42.060
one because we've been giving her hormones ever since she was seven

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:50.580
seven is the starting age Palace means Priestess of Athena who

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:56.820
carries the spear Priestess of Athena who carries the

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:04.740
spear and she has been on hormones through the Venoms that we're giving her

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.440
since she was seven years old and now she's 12 13 years old on the cusp of

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:17.459
what would naturally be for those of us who are not medusai those of us who are not under the

00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:23.160
regimen would we would start entering at 12 13 years old

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:29.519
um 14 we're finished and we're getting married we've cycled normally for a year everything's good we're getting married

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:36.540
she's in that pre-states but we've been giving her the drugs that are turning

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:42.360
her into something it causes her skin to become rough or

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:50.220
harsh they call it scaly in Greek scaly she loses sight during the day because

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:58.339
of the brightness she's known to inhabit the caves we call her the half virgin

00:10:58.339 --> 00:11:05.339
half Viper or the Echidna yes the Echidna so let's look some more at the

00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:12.000
hymns let's look some more as she emerges from the artist's hands this is like creation it's gorgeous okay the

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.899
second um the first line again please from Palace yes Palace she who is that only

00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:27.839
begotten daughter of God yes and by the way there's another word that comes with Palace to be from it

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:33.320
means to be from the great father

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:43.380
right from that great thundering father there is no word for the Sun

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:50.160
only the daughter this is a female centered cult that is creating these

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:58.740
terms that Jesus is using somewhere between 500 to 900 years after

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:05.220
the Greeks are performing their Mysteries right they're Mysteries excellent excellent let's read the line

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:14.940

that if you know how to use this secret name if you know the name

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:17.339
Seated on the throne that one is bound and when you're entering into this meter

00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:24.779
you're binding that one with your song they said in these mystery performances the song was more important than even

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:33.680
the drugs right even the communion the song was most important

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:46.079

the villages are are developed over time she is the one who works there are we

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:35.160
seeing Athena there's a lot more to the only born than you thought and this only born is

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:44.580
prophesied of we know it because Jehovah says I'm gonna be overcome by my

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.860
mono Guinness and that's why he consumes her mother

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:55.320
he consumes her because he doesn't want to get overthrown he doesn't want to get

00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:01.140
over there and Jehovah is a poopy guy he's a poopy guy and he wants

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:08.220
to stay in power he doesn't want to relinquish his power right so

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:15.900

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:22.080
this comes through the Hephaestus Right comes through the craft how do you open

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:28.740
the head of Jehovah to give birth to his daughter yeah we'll do one more line and we'll check in we'll check in

girls and to be like wow I'm you know impressed um their eyes supposedly were bloodshot

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:28.559
all the time and they used these poisons that they put in their hair and or archers they're on Archer horse

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:34.740
culture yeah Isn't that cool yeah that that's that sounds cool to me

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:42.480
um yeah and um what's the very next part of that line I told you guys the sigma Tau row root

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:51.000
the SDR oyster right she's causing Mania she's causing estrus right

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:59.460
what is she putting into asteriskas the souls proton of men The Souls of men and

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:06.900
where is she taking them into money I say Maniac excuse me into mania into

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:13.980
Maniac States you didn't think Athena the builder of the polis you didn't think that she was

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:21.720
the architect of mania did you she is she is the architect of mania yes okay

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:29.460
okay gorgeous one more one more line I want to get one more line in sorry

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.840
that's where we get the naked from the naked version what does that mean the naked virgin it means the one who

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:48.720
exercises naked which is not on you know the concept of

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:55.200
exercise and being naked is welded together in the Greek

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.960
so um when I am exercising um I am doing it naked you know when you

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:06.840
run the Olympic events you're running naked right and they're doing it through

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:12.659
Hera the worship of Hera the women are doing it um I would argue probably before I'll

00:23:12.659 --> 00:23:19.740
let the I'll let the folks who write books about such things make their declarations but

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:26.400
probably before the um the male was the female uh version so this virgin who

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:35.220
exercises naked is not you know the gymnast she is not necessarily an odd uh uh

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:43.679
figure this is not strange for us to Envision right it's not strange for us to Envision good and she has that thumon

00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:49.740
having that thumb on that is our chest her heart

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:56.460
her inner spirit her inner Spirit causes the quaking

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:04.620
causes the quaking okay so we have a Cora we know that she's this hybrid

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:12.000
she is the only born of the supreme ruler

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.960
she alone shares his traits yeah it's it's gorgeous

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:24.000
um let's let's uh let's give this scoop here on our image and um just ask

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.760
Matthias here Matthias um is there any is as you are working

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:35.159
and as the art is coming through your hands is this um like when you made the sculpture of

00:24:35.159 --> 00:24:41.100
the snake goddess as a as a younger as a 13 year old you know and you bring

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:48.059
coming up with the images in your mind and they're just kind of working themselves out organically

00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:53.220
um tell us what's going on here with this is this inspiration that you're going

00:24:53.220 --> 00:25:00.659
through what is this yeah this is really fun actually now that you mentioned it yeah so a couple

00:25:00.659 --> 00:25:08.100
of things like um when you mention her having only a spear um I actually I used the tool that I was

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:14.280
hoping with and then put it in her hand and it almost went on pretty naturally it looks pretty good on her too so it

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:20.900
was like she was meant to be holding it and also like um

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:29.520
yeah that's it I think yeah she looks really good this is like a sketch right this is like um you know I'm not going

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:35.159
for the the finish here I'm just really going through this for the process

00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:41.880
um for the the presentation you're giving um so I'm not worried about finishing it

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:47.760
as much as I am worried about just like um like trying different things and

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.799
having fun with what I'm doing and yeah it's pretty good yeah you you're

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:59.580
remaining faithful to the image aren't you and um just as Athena as worships on

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:06.120
Helicon where the Temple of the muses is then we know that their worship is I

frene yeah good good let's see what happens I

00:30:54.299 --> 00:31:00.600
bet it does something to the brain and I bet those priestesses end up that's why they're always deciding what

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:06.120
colony is going to go where and what the judgment is and they bring in this murder and they're like what do we do

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:47.460
in time we're talking about drugs we're talking about ritual and performance and

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:55.620

00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:45.600
she has the spots on the skin like the spotted serpent

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:52.799

the one from Triton the lake right right beautiful okay anyway

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:20.600
um and right after Iola morph right after Iola morph I want to make sure you're getting nope next one

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:28.620
bump yep there we go look what I've underlined in red yeah drakaina did you know Athena was a

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:36.299
dracana the dracana is the Draco yeah the serpent

00:33:36.299 --> 00:33:42.720
um the the one who has the combination of

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:49.320
the milk and the blood and you say milk how is she milking yes

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:55.399
we are milking her she is nursing right because she has this this hybrid

00:33:55.399 --> 00:34:02.159
has this chemical that we so value The Galena

00:34:02.159 --> 00:34:08.480
that comes from her breasts and they're described as grape-like

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.919
grape-like there's an accident from them that we use remember she's been on Venom

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:21.358
since she was seven and how do they oh by the way how do they put them on Venom um what I have seen textually is lateral

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:26.580
slits lateral slits that are covered up with a

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:33.599
drug impregnated bandage yeah so you go for the day and you get your you get your bandage right and you

00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:40.618
get your make your Cuts oh these aren't it's not bleeding make a cut until it bleeds and then right do it right

00:34:40.619 --> 00:34:46.020
medication she's shown that right by the older priestesses

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:51.540
so um when she's at that age at seven that's when she's brought in so this is

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:57.720
a process of building someone yes yes building the only born

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:03.480
and remember you are not to enter the bed

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.700
you're not into the bed of mating we'd say to them the image of the bad was the

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:16.079
image of that coupling of that coming together and you weren't supposed to do that and if you did you lost your head

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:24.480
right and what is she what is this holy virgin gymnast what does she wear on her

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:31.920
chest on the skin that's on her chest she wears the head of the medicine

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:37.980
nice nice gorgeous gorgeous how's our head coming

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:43.619
along do we have a Medusa head don't you love the gyrations when whenever

00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:51.180
Matthias is able to to bring life to her he moves her around and you see you can see he's able to

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:56.220
bring out because he has that art he's able to bring out that emotion that

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:04.500
image that feeling um this is why we need artists man to make our idols right thank you this is

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:10.380
antiquity bruh it's gorgeous gorgeous um what is after dracana bring up

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:16.079
drakina again what is after jakaina she's not only the serp the the serpent

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:23.040
Queen she is also feel and Dr rock those of you who know Dr

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.260
Rock will like it by the way I saw some people posting some stuff about Dr Rock

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:34.859
um and uh like it they like his work fantastic phenomenal um he was the one that I stood with in

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:40.800
Boston when we were talking about Harvard um and uh his research is of course

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:47.579
outstanding because he works with the sources right he doesn't you can't you can't get by anything with him he's a

00:36:47.579 --> 00:36:55.440
scientist right he brings you the sources anyway um uh Dr Rock coined the word

00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:01.619
um entheogen right in being in Theos being the God

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:06.740
and Jinn producing right so what is an entheogen and entheogen is a substance

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:12.540
that produces the God within now this is not

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:20.160
this is it's not like he just said oh I'm gonna I'm gonna cram some bases together and coin a word haha good for

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:26.400
me right now he didn't do that right this concept of in theosis right

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:36.060
um in our text here in our text right feeling she loves that infilling

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:42.420
she loves it when the god becomes one with you of course that

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:50.760
makes sense because that's what the Priestess is doing she is becoming Athena so that when she

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:57.900
has you under her spell and she's got you bound and drugged and she is singing

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:07.440
in your ear with that thundering powerful powerful voice

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:14.880
yeah um she is the atene she is the atene right Wow all I knew all we knew

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:22.980
about Athena was she's on the top of this Acropolis it's the woman symbol of the Athens in her freedom

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:28.800
yes yeah that's what we thought but wait a minute where are all the snakes and where all the what is all the ritual

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:33.839
right and what is what what is she doing she's inspiring us right she's the

00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:40.200
mother of the Arts the virgin mother of the Arts the virgin mother of the earth that's

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:46.079
why she hangs around the Temple of the muse right Temple of the Muse perfect okay

00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:51.660
and that last word Altera I'm gonna take you down to the

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:57.599
giganton she's the fighter of the Giants right the dispeller of the Giants she's

00:38:57.599 --> 00:39:03.060
the horse motivator the horse completer the horse driver

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:08.820
she's that tritogenea she's the destroyer of the Cocoon or the the

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:15.720
dissolver of the Cocoon no no such thing as pollution around this

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:21.420
around this only born there's no pollution you can't she can't stand in

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:29.040
the presence of it right she's in that antrum she's in that Center of that Temple good and then

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:34.859
finally um yes she's the victory bringing Diamond Victory bringing diamond or

00:39:34.859 --> 00:39:40.680
Athena Nikkei they call her right the bringer of the victory that's her and

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:46.980
finally um she's nocturnal and uh day of the day she's both of day and nights

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:52.020
serving the orice serving the hours what

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:58.920
does that mean when you say serving the hours all of a sudden you project yourself back into the Bronze Age with

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:05.579
the worship of the aura the Ori is the sun and the moon and the stars

00:40:05.579 --> 00:40:12.060

or gray Ops eyes so they call her the gray eyed the gray eyed but that gray-eyed that

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:30.839
epithet the gray eyed belongs to that gorgophonic group

00:41:30.839 --> 00:41:38.280
right the ones that bring that magic that's their gray-eyed appearance gray

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:43.380
eyed thing the Ops is what you look you look

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:50.280
in my the Ops is what you look into when you confront the goddess when you stand

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:58.200

00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:17.280
the pololiste Basile the queen who is most

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:24.960
prayed to the one who is the really accepts those that form of communication

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:31.380

girl or virgin half virgin half Viper and if you get 12 of these

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:51.300
together in a group you're invincible you're absolutely Invincible 12

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:57.060
archerouses with poison bows who use Venoms not only do they use Venoms but

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:02.220
as you can see from our sculpture she was raised on Venom

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:07.740
she was raised on Venom so she is a different form you didn't know Humanity

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:13.560
was capable of this form did you now you maybe you understand why they worshiped

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:20.280
her why they worshiped her why they brought her out why they took the

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:27.060
children of the aristocracy why they put them through if they had the perfect

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:37.619
qualifications why they put them through this regimen in order to reach this process of the

00:43:37.619 --> 00:43:43.200
of the virgin yeah the virgin lamia

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:52.980
yeah it's um absolutely absolutely the Pinnacle of the combo of drugs and cult

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:58.800
and it is the mystery if you talk about Christianity as a mystery and you fail

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:05.400
to recognize what a mystery is you have no clue you're believing the fairy tale

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:12.119
right you're following the fairy tales you're not looking at history and reason you're looking at the fairy tale

00:44:12.119 --> 00:44:18.720
your faith will lead you to the fairy tale to accept it reason will lead you

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:23.880
to the reality right and there's no question whether or not you want to accept the reality

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:29.819
because the reality doesn't care Judaism and Christianity are the

00:44:29.819 --> 00:44:38.339
offshoot or the offshoot of this oracular mystery she is Bronze Age she

00:44:38.339 --> 00:44:44.819
is before you and she manifests herself in the queen

00:44:44.819 --> 00:44:50.640
yes in the queen all of this pharmacology goes back somewhere and

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:57.660
every signpost that I've seen points directly to caucus to the witch Medea

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:07.460
who is developing the Echidna she alone we know she alone can breathe that fire

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:12.619
yes gorgeous gorgeous give me the ability iason

00:45:12.619 --> 00:45:18.960
iason people will tell you okay I'm gonna I'm gonna say one more thing and then I'm gonna check back in with Rob

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:27.540
because I want to see the magic is is happening we we want to see that image

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:33.180
um and we don't want to get lost in the fairy tale we just want to know

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:38.819
what those people were doing we want to we want to push it and we want to say who who is she what does she look like

00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:44.280
where does she stand what does she do um how did she affect history and when

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:49.440
you follow when you um when you follow the language through

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:56.579
the medwa right medwa and Medusa are the same root they're the same root medicine where we

00:45:56.579 --> 00:46:02.400
get our word medicine it's the same root and you you look at lexicographers and

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:08.700
they'll they'll argue about um Maga and Mada and where those ultimately come from and just long story

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:15.780
short the Mada is the moistness it is the do it is the manna that you reap

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:22.440
from between her legs yeah they were using these chemicals

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:29.460
they were using them in rights and if you were a Christian you are not part of

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:37.920
a mystery for any reason you are part of a mystery because that is the history that your

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:44.460
religion and its practices developed and Jesus stood there and said I am the

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:49.560
monogamous when he did that when his Apostles wrote

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:58.200
that he was the mono Guinness they were claiming a right to a throne

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:03.240
to the throne of God and now you understand now you

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:10.980
understand let's look at let's look at the image um tell us a couple of words here Mathias tell give us a couple of words

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:17.760
about how you're feeling as you make as you as you bring bring to life what kind

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:24.420
of um tell us about her that you're that you're making for a couple of minutes just you know free form

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:30.599
yeah sure I kind of want her to be a little bit like she's like she's

00:47:30.599 --> 00:47:35.819
doing some kind of interrogation so a lot of the times when I'm playing around

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:40.099
with her I'm sort of seeing

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:47.099
how how like somebody if she was huge right she was like six foot tall how she

00:47:47.099 --> 00:47:52.200
would look to somebody if they walked up to her like if she's asking a question

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:59.520
or if she's about to attack or something because right now she's just standing there but I'm wondering like

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:04.400
when somebody looks at her how should they feel

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:12.780
no that power of the thing that you're using there with the S curve tell us a

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:18.780
little bit about that oh the S curve yeah so the S curve is

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:24.000
something that like it gives it a really like interesting

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.339
shape it puts your hips forward your shoulders back this is like what you'll see what

00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:35.220
models will do so they'll walk like this and it just elongates the body and it

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:42.660
gives it a lot of like expression so it gives it a really sort of elegant expression to the body

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:48.839
instead of her just being standing regularly

00:48:48.839 --> 00:48:55.079
she sort of loses a little bit of the intensity of her body

00:48:55.079 --> 00:49:01.380
I noticed that you've captured the combination of her masculinity and

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:08.700
femininity she's supposed to be female possessing masculine traits which I

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:15.900
think is a reflection of her coreic status and you have captured that you have really you have wrote Bravo you've

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:24.060
really captured that because I look at different parts of her and I'm trying to identify masculine feminine age and I

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:30.240
see that you've you've honed in you've you've honed in on that power of that of

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:35.640
that perfect combination right that perfect combination

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:43.200
um yeah why don't you tell me about um why don't you tell me about the snakes and

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:52.920
um yeah that by the way Matthias look at that hand everyone look at that left hand I mean uh wow I mean that says a

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:59.700
lot and it says different things from different angles I want to bring up I said before we're going to talk about Mr

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:05.099
Ferrari Atari Ferrari right Ferrari right and his

00:50:05.099 --> 00:50:13.140
um here he is watch how he did the same thing like when you look at her head when you look at the angle that it is if

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:18.540
you rotate the angle of her head you'll see different positions of power you'll

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:25.260
see different poses in her and um for example if we got under her head

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:33.300
and we're looking at her from from the ground up as if she is looking at us with you see how as as Mateus changes

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:38.880
his shape all of a sudden the new emotion comes comes into the face let's

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:45.660
see let's see if he's meeting up with his ancestor um let's see if you're an ancestor let's

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:50.940
see if we can call you the seed uh of Ferrari um can we show Giordano Bruno

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:59.400
that for who Ferrari made yeah you see that um what about that what about that angle

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:06.960
there isn't that lovely does that do anything for you that's that's the particular statue matteus yeah of course

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:13.920
it's pretty it's interrogating you right so you're looking up at him and he's looking down at you and I'm sure that

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:19.319
the sun positions itself behind him so it's like he's backlit and it looks holy

00:51:19.319 --> 00:51:24.839
you know you see and he's he's in this like dark

00:51:24.839 --> 00:51:31.500
Hood he looks down at you he's sort of it's almost like he's asking you a question he's interrogating you I really

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:37.559
like that about this this um this statue especially because I

00:51:37.559 --> 00:51:43.200
don't know much about Jordan and Bruno but I know he was a pretty intense guy

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:48.420
um so I think that this is like it does a lot of like just in terms of the

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:53.640
intensity of the of the pose and the intensity of the of

00:51:53.640 --> 00:52:01.319
the look and the intensity of the angle that this hope that this um statues positioned is like really

00:52:01.319 --> 00:52:07.260
speaking to his like nature and where did where did Ferrari

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:12.480
um or or you know he made the Statue but they placed it in a specific Square

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:18.599
wasn't it the square where they burned him alive yep it's in Rome so I'm not sure what

00:52:18.599 --> 00:52:25.319
the name of the square is but yeah it's the exact place and um the the Catholic Church you know wasn't really happy

00:52:25.319 --> 00:52:30.980
about that but um there wasn't much they could do

00:52:33.059 --> 00:52:40.800
and from what I hear and from what I hear um poor poor G Bruno we'll just call him

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:47.520
G Bruno poor G Bruno was um brought up on some kind of impiety some kind of

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:55.020
charge against the church um he was he was who knows what it was you know actually for right but he was

00:52:55.020 --> 00:53:01.920
saying he was saying things about planets about other planets and about the life that was on those other planets

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:09.000
out there and we know that that angered the church because it com it throws off

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:15.119
um their cosmogony right we don't their cosmography is suddenly incomplete and I'm not talking about the church's

00:53:15.119 --> 00:53:20.460
cosmogony isn't the orphic cosmogony right they have that they created their

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:26.760
own in the Middle Ages because the orphan cosmogony that started the mystery

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:33.900
um was Pagan and they wanted to re to assert some sort of um hey no this is originally our days of

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:42.119
creation or our days of creation right and even though we're starting with the Earth and uranos right

00:53:42.119 --> 00:53:48.540
um we're going to give you a new impression of that cosmogony so um it didn't fit it didn't fit all the

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:56.520
planets those of you who are out there and there are a lot of educated um people on this um Channel and those

00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:02.579
of you are educated and who who know some Bruno and I know that there are those of you who are out there

00:54:02.579 --> 00:54:08.160
um uh you may be able to appreciate this um a little bit with I don't know I may

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:14.880
just throw out an ass a golden ass to you and um who knows maybe the Ferrari

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:21.420
you think the Ferrari image was an ass a golden ass first what do you think Matthias

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:27.960
a golden ass verse the fiery image of what exactly like the JoJo the Jordana

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:35.700
Bruno sculpture no I'm talking about the horse on the um golden background yeah

00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:42.318
um the horse on the golden background with the modern Ferrari yeah

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:49.500
the cars right yeah yeah um yeah it's a black horse on a golden

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:56.280
field and I'm not exactly sure um what the history of it is like

00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:02.700
entirely but I do know or if it's like a legitimate um like uh

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:09.180
what's it called like um a coat of arms but I do know that it used to be a donkey before

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:15.660
so a black donkey and a golden field nice nice perhaps we don't know perhaps

00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:21.599
they're using some of the same imagery yeah yeah um

00:55:21.599 --> 00:55:29.280
I'm talking by the way I'm talking about the the logo the Ferrari the card the logo right the The Black Stallion

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:34.559
um I also do know that uh the um

00:55:34.559 --> 00:55:41.940
that uh one of the nicknames for um Enzo fari was a a drag so they used to call

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:48.780
him the Dragon ah those those old those old European

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:56.460
families that preserve all of the all of the old medieval symbols that ultimately

00:55:56.460 --> 00:56:03.839
are derived um from the roots of Hellenistic culture from Greek culture that's gorgeous I

00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:10.980
