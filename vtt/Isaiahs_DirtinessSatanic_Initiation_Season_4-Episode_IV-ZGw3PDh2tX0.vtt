something by the scholars and you can go Wikipedia all you want and you'll find

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.020
that you've been told the same thing um and you're reading the Bible you're

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:20.039
reading Isaiah and you thank your reading Isaiah but the sad fact is you're not

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.080
you are reading a Hebrew fabrication

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.720
brought to you through the eyes of a British king

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.720
yes that's what you're doing you're reading a text that doesn't exist

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:44.580
it had to be made up tonight we go to the Septuagint the

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:51.000
earliest form of this text the one that we have

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.240
that everybody was reading and quoting right it's all over Jesus's mouth did you think we came here for any other

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:03.240
reason then to further our case against Jesus right and trans-dimensional court

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.280
right no right that's what we do that's why we're here our cons and everything

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:16.860
we're gonna get some archons tonight love it okay so here we are um that's our way in to the Jesus is

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:23.000
through this Isaiah right he's one of the guys on the inside and he knows but

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.819
what happens is in the 10th century these maseries and everybody says

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:37.199
everybody says every America Hebrew Hebrew um I defy you to find for me

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:44.520
any genre just find a genre of Aramaic find a genre of literature in Hebrew

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:51.720
outside of what has been appropriated that you and I call the Old Testament now thanks to the kings of the

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:58.319
Christians yes Kings and popes love it love it we're going back to the

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:05.580

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:10.680
Greek document and tonight we're going in that Temple when we're seizing that

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.840

Greek text that we're working with right right okay wait kitties wait kitties

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.040
pull it down and then put it back up I forgot I forgot this is the part I like

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:18.480
best right hey kitties this is how it worked yeah there were

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:26.220
all of these books these Scrolls and they all had Hebrew on them it was

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:34.339
something called The Books of Moses and we translated those magically

00:13:34.339 --> 00:13:40.320
magically under the alexandrian influence the ptolemies we translate

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:46.320
this we got 72 guys we got a couple from each tribe we sent them into rooms and

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:53.420
rabbis were like do it and all of a sudden each of them

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:59.220
wrote out a perfect exactly the same translation and that's what the

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:06.360
Septuagint is um and you don't believe that right because

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.760
you don't believe in fairy tales right we're classical philologists here

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:20.339
I don't care what the Theology of that is it's a bunch of crap yes this text this is originally Greek

00:14:20.339 --> 00:14:25.500
text let's go back to it that's 10th Century stuff right the maserates came

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.660
along the maserites were like dude if we don't establish they're like dude if we

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:36.480
don't establish the holy power of the Hebrew

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:43.260
um then nothing belongs to us right you can't have your Orthodoxy if

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:51.860
your Hebrew isn't your holy language oh God yeah well 600 years before any of this

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:57.260
proto-hebrew ever appeared Greek was long established through the mycedeans

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:04.920

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:10.799
that great flocks what oh I'm sorry that's an ancient mystery term that's in

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:16.799
the text that you don't know how to translate so you don't know blah blah blah that's what you get for having

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:23.580
Scholars that suck right so say the Watchers having my conversation the other day

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:29.039
with the Watchers again I'm like dude you know I don't know

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:35.700
um if they really do we are we going all the way or you know it's like well they're teachers man but what kind of

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:44.400
teachers they've got look what kind of teachers they've got go on Wikipedia look up the septuagen

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:50.100
look at what kind of teachers you've got look at what the scholars come to the

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:57.960
biblical Scholars those great biblical Scholars that haven't I was trying to I was working with the

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:04.080
potentially student yeah letting them know that I wasn't going to teach him New Testament unless he read everything

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.840
around it unless he had an ad extreme to drink from unless he could bring homer

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:17.220
which is being taught in the first century unless he could bring Homer right I think it was overwhelming for

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.260
him right you got to know the level of commitment you have to your sources

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:28.700
we're investigators man this is not a game do you see me do You See Me selling

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:34.860

00:21:55.919 --> 00:22:02.100
the cosmos and wait a minute those of you who have been with us from the beginning all of a

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:08.700
sudden he's speaking your language how is this possible how is this Prophet taste do you realize

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:14.700
the word Prophet is a Greek word do you realize the word synagogue is a

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:20.280
Greek word huh do you see why the masserates very

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:26.220
intelligently said if we're going to own this material we've got to create a

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:34.159
Hebrew original King James picked that up and ran with it he was like it's all good with me

00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:39.659
and then everybody after him even in Wycliffe you know everybody gets

00:22:39.659 --> 00:22:44.700
those Wycliffe translators um they give them such Kudos kudos for

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:51.679
you guys you Wick of translators look what you've done your translation sucks

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:58.860
it sucks yes fantastic yeah why

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:04.140
because it's a science and you have to you know we're all scientists sitting

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:10.340
here and you have to exercise discretion

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:15.960
scientific discretion with these sources you have to pull up the language and let

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:23.159
the language give you the the amino acids that are your basis for Life yeah

00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:29.760
it's gorgeous okay this the Isaiah open your mouth again take off that take off

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:36.240
that dead prophet's ball gag no don't do that don't use that I'm just kidding I

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:42.059
wouldn't do that once you've got somebody in that position you gotta wait for all the drugs to wear off anyway

00:23:42.059 --> 00:23:50.539
right okay um Babylon right it keeps going on about Babylon until we get to verse 21.

00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:57.659
21. do we have those up here bring us verse 21 up there for the 21 and 22. 21

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:05.640
husbands they're called maters and they go out and they chase them down
