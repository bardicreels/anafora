number 13 by the way before we get to the climax of this I know it's

00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:35.160
but before we get to the climax I want to say we had over,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:43.199
1300 people live in Greek I am fairly certain that that

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:48.600
breaks an alltime record yeah I don't know if there's

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.839
1300 Greek graduate students in this country I don't know in the states I

you're gonna go in the right okay so hold on don't wait it gets weird it gets

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:53.000
weird keep uh let's go find the the next quote there boom yeah here we go and one

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.559
happens that Beast also has those seven heads what are those heads they are the

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:08.679
prominent singular ingredients that are used in the death

00:18:08.679 --> 00:18:15.919
inducer this is a concoction or a Poma that will lay you

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:22.880
out it will kill you but don't worry remember what Jesus

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:28.840
said I'll show you you'll pick up those

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:37.280
death inducing potions and you won't die they won't hurt you why because they're

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.840
using within the mystery they're using the drugs that induce death combined

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:51.679
with the Beast that will bring you back the Beast Bears up the cup of Lady

00:18:51.679 --> 00:19:01.039
Babylon right okay are you ready we're getting deeper and deeper into that prophecy and

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:07.679
what I'm fulfilling for you tonight is I am unsealing these

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:14.320
works oh God can you believe the devil gave me that I was like are you sure and

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:21.480
he was like dude you know you earned it right how did I earn it one of the

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:29.720
things I didn't do is I didn't monetize oh and I didn't monetize lady

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:35.960
Babylon yeah yeah people are saying I had a comment I thought this was great

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:42.320
this is illustrative of Christianity this is why Julian said

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.559
Christianity will overthrow classical civilization and he was right this is

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:53.640
one of the reasons one of the reasons they burn those libraries

00:19:54.679 --> 00:20:01.919
down yeah because they don't know what the texts

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:09.760
say isn't that funny it's like you hang yourself so we're here satanic

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.000
congregation to bring those texts to them and to show them give it to me

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.440
again I want some drugs and witchery Jesus show me all your drugs your drugs

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:28.760
Jesus what do we have here oh God those seven principal drugs you know what they

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:34.280
they have they have names they have

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:41.360
names and what kind of names do they have they have names of

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:49.400
blasphemy names of blasphemy remember we talked about the

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:56.200

fire to burn the people using it you know what we do after we come in with

00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:50.040
this bowl we drink this stuff and it causes us to go to a place that is very very painful I've already been going a

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:57.960
little bit nuts anyway and chew in my tongue isn't that a great symptom can you see imagine you walk into a right

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:03.359
that's a mystery right like the origin of Judaism and Christianity and Islam

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:09.960
and you walk in because remember the Muslims they say Worship bakus in an Aphrodite right not the Muslim the the

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:17.280
people living in Arabia who were the ancestors of the Muslims right that that they were

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:22.480
worshiping bakas right they're doing the same thing they're doing the exact same

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:29.040
thing in a saturnian right which linguistically is Satan when the row and

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:33.640

your mind a little bit at least it does mine it does so we're pouring out and we're causing

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:07.160
that fire right and what's going to happen let's pull up a chorus as we're entering you know we all came we all saw

Visionary stuff is crazy we're still going to bring in the children let's just bring him in oh jeez come

here Jesus I'm sorry I got to show him the kids tonight you hold it Jesus holds his

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:14.400
tongue well he must be used to that it's a Roman thing let's go you know why they

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:21.680
dislike those lace days so much right right you know why they dislike the

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:28.559
lace they're crucifying them man because about a hundred years no not that long

00:48:28.559 --> 00:48:36.720
um but within a century before Jesus is walking around as a l or at least he's denying that he's a l Stace and Mark um

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:43.160
about a hundred years before that within that Century um Julius Caesar he got a

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:48.800
abducted and he was so mad at those fraking people he went back and he um

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:57.480
insisted that they all be crucified cuz that is the only fitting punishment um that cross people

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:03.240
is not for a common thief or a common

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:11.400
criminal that cross is for people who crowds come together and say this dude

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:17.799
crucify yeah it was that ultimate it was that ultimate punishment every time you

00:49:17.799 --> 00:49:24.880
see see we as a society under the influence of Christianity have tried to make that cross a place where the

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:30.920
innocent are placed right this is a place of torture right the Romans the

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:38.200
evil Romans invented it right it's very fairy talish but the

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:45.000
fact is that's what Caesar did he see had him crucified because he wanted him to suffer and it was heinous enough with

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:51.200
the what Pirates do to to get them crucified traffickers

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:57.040
baby human traffickers does anybody have any sympathy is there a book in where

00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:02.920
it's like my beloved human trafficking husband no there's a good reason for

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:09.240

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:33.840
number three number three to touch or to affect somebody to grasp with the senses

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.199
that's a nice metaphorical to be handsy with reality and to become perspective I

01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:45.440
like that oh no chew's pointing out number five you mean this word is used

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.000
for straight up intercourse I'm not talking just molestation I'm not saying

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.600
Jesus is just molesting those kids I'm saying is penetrating them with his

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:05.560
hands and why is he penetrating them with his hands because he is app applying the very same drugs that are on

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:11.679
that naked child's private parts when he is in the Garden of

01:11:11.679 --> 01:11:17.159
Gethsemane Jesus is a professional

01:11:17.159 --> 01:11:22.600
play and he is making more trafficking

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:27.239
adult uh children making more children

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:33.000
trafficable within what remember the only times Jesus is mad is when somebody

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.480
tries to stomp him doing this to children and when he's up face to face

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:45.520
with the pimps in the temple right and he's like no way man this is my territory he's kicking over

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:53.080
money tables and stuff like that you thought he was an angel didn't you you didn't realize he's just a pimp finding

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:58.719
and establishing his territory right he comes from Egypt baby when he

01:11:58.719 --> 01:12:04.719
came back to this Podunk Jerusalem do you know what do you know what he did he

01:12:04.719 --> 01:12:11.040
went in the temple and he so impressed the people with his educated

boy is he GNA be worried about getting

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:09.360
scandalized you know if Jesus hadn't been arrested with a naked kid I would

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:15.360
