00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.559
countries together with the temples for whenever or wherever they demolish the

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:25.360

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:32.640
concept that your ancest ERS are sitting there right now watching you imagine

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:40.679
this America imagine Tom Jefferson is watching you right

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:46.760
now it's a good thing that we have that seed within us these are the treasures

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:52.679
of wisdom that is not monest it is not

00:28:52.679 --> 00:28:58.880
Christian it is not Jewish it is not Islamic it is polytheistic

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:05.760
a recognition that your ancestors are

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:12.760
participating from a distance isn't that nice you can summon those people you can bring up their

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:19.760
writings and you can bring them out and show people what was in their minds do you know the real origin of American

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:28.559
democracy the real origin of American democracy is in mother Greek it's in the language

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:33.960
you can go down you don't have to believe any of the stories that's not what classical philologists do classical

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:39.519
philologists just translate but what is the benefit of that translation the

00:29:39.519 --> 00:29:45.679
benefit is you get to drink from that classical spring and it's

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:54.679
delicious Tyrant after Tyrant after Tyrant show us what's going to happen to you take us to the Future are you ready

00:29:54.679 --> 00:30:01.320
um to mankind a theme gives the blessings of wisdom and intelligence and the creative

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:09.279
arts now those of you who are out there who are saying to yourself wait is this polytheism it sounds so

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:14.840
reasonable yeah do you know what Athena is she is that wisdom and intelligence

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:21.200
those creative arts do you love the creative arts do you love wisdom and

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:28.039
intelligence do you worship Athena you better you better because she sets up

00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:33.440
justice system and surely she dwells in the capitals of cities didn't you see

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:40.240
she's in our Capital she dwells there the people who set this all up did not

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:47.840
set it up on the basis of Christianity that is fake history it is fake history that's being

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.679
sold to you as propaganda and surely she dwells in the capitals of cities because

00:30:53.679 --> 00:30:59.279
through her wisdom she has established the community of the

00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:07.039
state go ahead the community of the state do you know what your country is

00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:14.720
based on your country is based on Athena and the worship of

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:20.600
wisdom and the first the first words out there that First

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:28.519
Amendment says at all you will not create

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:36.679
a state religion nope not going to happen that is exactly what is being

00:31:36.679 --> 00:31:42.120
done through the power of the Tyrant a state

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:49.799
sanctioned religion yeah it's cyclical people it

00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:55.840
happens it's it's product of nature it happens what do we say I have still to

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:02.480
say a few words about Aphrodite okay what are the gods do we those of us who started democracy what are the gods do

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:09.480
we worship that help us to fight the Tyrant I have still to say a few words about Aphrodite who as the wise men

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:15.320
among the Phoenicians affirm and as I believe assists Helios in the creative

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:24.080
function wait a minute you have a you have a female Creator imagine that imagine that for a

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:30.440
second a female creator let that percolate through your

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:37.360
brain she is in very truth a synthesis of the Heavenly Gods what and in their

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:43.880
Harmony she is the spirit of love and unity now the monis came out and they've

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:50.880
said we are going to unify yeah you're going to unify yourselves and everybody

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:57.480
else you're going to kill or enslave that's the way it works it's

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:03.200
going to be be fast too don't think tyrants don't work slowly they don't they don't need they don't need a

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:09.960
congress right the Congress just becomes a stamp that's how it works when you

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:16.799
transition from some kind of republic or constitutional democracy to an imperial

00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:22.799
bureaucracy that's how it works and here we come here we come with tears in their

00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:28.279
eyes they're coming and you have to sit there and see it coming because that's our

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:20.480

when we created democracy who else was there with us Hermes and Aries Hermes and Aries are connected

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:03.640
with healing right because what are we worshiping we're worshiping Satan religion this is

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:10.160
of the Sun the moon and the stars this is the power of hacky this is the fury

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:15.560
of dionis and you've got to have the

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:22.400
hermeneutics and you've got to have the war that repulsive Force do you know

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:28.560
what is great about being strong you can honor every

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:35.520
you can honor the ability to push away that which is causing you to

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:43.319
fall right okay so this is all built in it's baked into the Democracy if you are

00:36:43.319 --> 00:36:50.640
a tyrant you are everything that is opposed and it doesn't matter if you stand there and say we're the I am the

defender of democracy do you know who says I'm the defender of democracy the

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:03.000
Tyrant I everything out of the Liar's mouth is Bizarro world you just turn it upside

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.680
down when he says I am not a tyrant he's saying I am a tyrant when he's saying I am a defender of democracy he's saying I

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:13.920
am not a defender of democracy yeah

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:19.839
yeah when he says Unity he means

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:27.720
disunity that's how the magic of the Tyrant works baby how else do you think they get in power besides lying

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:34.640
tyrants are marked by their tongue that has no truth it has no truth and if you

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:42.160
love I'm going to say this to those of you who love the Tyrant I'm gonna say it because I have a lot of viewers who love

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:49.599

00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:01.680
forcefully it doesn't matter who you're going to

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:09.960

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:09.960
recognize that helos is the common Lord since he is celebrated as the father of

have period by far by far and what happens I tell you all the time the

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:04.560
Romans they're always trying to well you know Latin has some positive things to it too and you know why they're doing it

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:11.000
because everybody knows as they watch Greek take over and as the Emperors begin to write in Greek because why

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.880
would you write in Latin it just can't confer what the Greek can confer right okay for the Romans themselves not only

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:24.280
belong to the Greek race but also the sacred ordinances and the pious belief in the gods which they have established

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:32.280
and maintained are from beginning to end and Greek coming from the language not the

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:37.480
people right not the ethnicities coming from the

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:45.960
language and we know people walk around and say Jews and Gentiles you know that didn't exist what did people say Greeks

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:52.720
and barbarians those are the two they classified people on their

00:42:52.720 --> 00:43:00.240
language wow what a monstrously powerful gor gous lady mother Greek is and beside

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:06.680
this they have established a constitution not inferior to that of any one of the best governed states do you

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:11.800
think the Christians were talking about constitutions no

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:17.480
no that's not how theocracy works it's not how monism

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:22.880
works if indeed it be not Superior to all others that have ever been put into

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:28.920
practice for which reason I myself recognized says libanus that our city is

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:36.000
Greek both in descent and in its Constitution let me tell you this today

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:44.240
America is Greek in descent it is Greek in its

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:51.640
Constitution the people who formed it were bre breathing The Ether of that

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:57.839
classical Source they were breathing it's ether oh God

00:43:57.839 --> 00:44:03.359
it was that Fifth Element thing ah the vapors of it were so freeing we're so

00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:10.440
freeing give me the next one chewy give me the next one boom now I'm gonna put some Greek up

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:16.040
here since I've been not putting up a lot of Greek tonight look what we're doing here's the himym to Helios here's

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:23.200

his father right the aan who who is who is um Yuri fisa that

00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:53.520
that glorious shining one who is the mother of Helios who is she who is she

that your democracy came from this dawnbringer came from this

00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:41.359
tradition oh God give me the next one give me the next one um now that the

00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:46.680
human race possesses its knowledge of God by Nature okay where are we going

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:51.880
back to we're going back to Julian we're going back to libanus we're going back to the

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:57.720
pagans we're going back to the pagans um who are

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:04.599

my eyes right these are the people and what is what does that generation of

00:46:18.079 --> 00:46:23.440
pagans have to say to them now that the race the human race possesses its

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:31.280
knowledge of God by nature and not from teaching is proed to us first of all by

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:38.760
the universal yearning for the Divine that is in all people whether private or

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:44.520
communities what does the pagans say in response to the monism your faith is

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:52.480
everything to you says the Pagan to the monest your faith is everything but you know what faith is something handed down

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:59.400

says this guy has an uncle who practices a closeness a communion with

00:53:39.839 --> 00:53:47.240
the gods more than he does with people even though he knows the law expressly

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:53.640
forbids it under punishment of death under punishment of death if you don't

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:59.119
want to worship Jesus Christ if you don't want to worship Jesus

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:38.719
tyrant you want to be a tyrant the cure to the Tyrant is

01:14:38.719 --> 01:14:45.840
not stepping in front of them the cure to the Tyrant is accelerating them to

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:51.960
bring their own doom and in the process everybody else gets punished isn't that

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:58.360

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:39.159
mind and with this hatred in her

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:47.880
eyes she does something she transfers it to the bronze Tyrant she takes his

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:54.440
vision and she gives him the fury and what what is it that she's actually doing here's the verb here's the Greek

01:15:54.440 --> 01:16:00.840
verb give me next one here's the Greek verb that she's actually doing to the

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:55.440

what she's gonna do she's going to Grudge the Tyrant okay I want you to

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:31.920
think about this is one of those Advanced Greek Concepts you know how you send the Mania

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:39.080
to the Tyrant to accelerate his Doom you Grudge him or you begrudge

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:47.159
him his power power should only be held by those

01:17:47.159 --> 01:17:54.520
who are just the universe is out of order when the unjust

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:59.679
or those who have usurped Justice are now in

01:17:59.679 --> 01:18:06.800
control so media begrudges him that power do you see what happens what she

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:13.560
is doing mentally with the image give me the next one what she's doing mentally with the image she is begrudging him and

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:20.679
what happens she throws at him her whole on her ho on she makes

01:18:20.679 --> 01:18:26.120
fantasies that will correspond to the

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:32.560
maddening uh serpent Venom fantasies for your mind do you

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:39.920
know what tyrants do when they are anointed by God they become

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:48.360
paranoid they all become paranoid because it's not right for them to have

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:54.400
power and in the middle of their souls they know the lies are all lies and I

01:18:54.400 --> 01:19:01.760
have sert Justice to be here they know that instinctively nature

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:07.040
puts that within them and do you know what that does to the human mind to know

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:13.639
that you have taken power and you are illegitimate to know that you have cast

01:19:13.639 --> 01:19:18.920
aside Justice it makes you afraid because

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:25.440
there's always another attempt coming tyrants are never never safe

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:31.960
they're never safe what happens to the Mind under

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:37.080
these circumstances well let me tell you what happened to Talos he got really

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:43.360
pissed off he got really pissed off while media is doing this he is getting

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:51.840
really pissed off and he kills himself yeah he brushes up against a a

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:58.360
sharp Rock and cuts open a vein and his leg and he bleeds himself out all his

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:07.520
holy ior comes out yeah that is the fate of the Tyrant

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:12.840
it will happen exactly that

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:19.600
way exactly as the Paradigm of the mystery demands that it takes place

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:26.360
exactly in the same way it's physics people it's physics now we just know if

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:33.840
we just know those songs we can come to the aid of America

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:40.360

Christianity no no we didn't leave those we're squarely in their world and this

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:52.000
is why John or whoever wrote The Apocalypse who clipped out all of the

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.920
Sian oracles and then put them into orders that they weren't supposed to go in and Sh shaved it here and tucked it

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:06.040
