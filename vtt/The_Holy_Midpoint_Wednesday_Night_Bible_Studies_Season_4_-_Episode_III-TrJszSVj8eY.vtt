00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.939
in and I just want to let people be a sounding board here and let's hear what

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.280
they're saying can you bring the first one up Chewie thanks

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:19.500
oh fantastic I'm obviously not Christian but almond is not a valuable source for

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.879
a lot of Classics information yes the Christian church has done a lot of harm to people don't get me started

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:35.280
on Christianity's harm to indigenous peoples in my country but you do not need to falsify what

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.920
happened in the Bible to present that position there are ulterior motives on

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.280
almonds part he has a vendetta not only because of the harms that Christianity

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.319
has done but because he was kicked out of teaching at Christian schools for

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.140
inappropriate behavior I.E putting a dildo in a play with children as

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.739
audiences there are better ways to figure fight against the abuses of Christianity than

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.459
building a cult of hate that was from dark Celestial witch that was from dark

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:18.659
Celestial which dark Celestial witch thank you for your time thank you for paying attention and thank

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.739
you for your input yes when the when the

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.959
uh when the group that critiques

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.959
reviews classical Scholars upcoming and already coming

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.900
called brenmar when they critique the chemical Muse they said this is a

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.379
dangerous book almond obviously has ulterior motives

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.959
ulterior motives these are ulterior motives floating around I love it

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:03.060
I love ulterior motives why wouldn't I um yes the problem is we want the text

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.780
Divine dark witch and so we're going to those texts whether anybody likes it or

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.959
not so um truly it's the material it's the

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:24.860
material that cuts show so sharply it's the reason that you cannot be 100

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:32.699
faithful to that Muse of antiquity and still sell yourself

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:38.280
within a system that is designed to sell yes

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.740
um but hey we look for the Pure Source we look for the Pure Source and

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.520
um next comment please let's do another one this is good it's good feedback

um a full hour I don't know what happened that night let's go on to the last comment please

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:19.139
almonds passed with a Christian hierarchy oh this sounds it already sounds good listen to it sounds like a

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:26.639
sounds like a historian slash psychologist slash expert in the Inquisition

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.699
almonds passed with a Christian hierarchy it's just a tinge just the

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:39.300
tinge of arrogance I love it love is my religion

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.940
do you have a name Love Is My Religion has resulted in

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:51.180
building hatred towards Jesus condemn the excessiveness but you have

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.340
no understanding says love is my religion of Jesus's teachings

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.120
you are filled with hatred and negativity

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:10.139
remember what we have to the way that we have to walk as satanists is always

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:16.740
facing reality always facing reality

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:24.360
um we need to dive into this work if nothing else based upon the resistance

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.840
the resistance is there to do so we are reconstructing the mystery and of course

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.520
of course it's going to make people afraid we're here on warrant right we

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.780
have a we have a there's an indictment against this guy you know on in how many

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.919
parallel universes yes there's an indictment always ending up in the

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:52.860
garden always ending up in the garden with the boy yes bring that last comment up one more

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.440

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:06.120
have to put the S after it that's okay whoops can you get us back there we go um in the Christian hierarchy resulted

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.759

yes when you do come back and tell me about the pirate

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:09.720

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:28.620
to take that resistance you feel that resistance use it as a wave

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:34.140
use it as a wave right for as much as you desire

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.540
to uncover they desire to cover up

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:46.440
right these are the same people that Shout at the bank of cameras that are

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:53.060

yes yes right remember

00:10:00.779 --> 00:10:07.680
there's just one question job brings the whole thing down

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:14.700
right it's not that the man's entire family was killed

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:20.339
that's not what bothers us what bothers us is whether he would curse The God Who

00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:25.980
would do it yeah yeah [Music]

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:32.160
I tell you this much if somebody killed my whole family after lying to them I sure as heck would not be

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:39.540

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:32.340
for in that day an hour you will see the divine order of the Skies

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:40.260
what is that Divine or order of the Skies now those of you with the

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:46.860
um Edition that I'm reading from which is the hands theater bats image of

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:53.220
addition part of which John Scarborough translated [Music]

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:59.400
um those of you who have that you're one step away you're one step

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:06.840
away but remember you're still a step away you're not receiving that pure stream you're receiving it filtered

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.940
Okay so what is this thing is that what it says

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:18.360
that's not what it actually says is it I've got it up here I'm gonna search my Greek

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:25.320
for it today I'm not quite sure what order perhaps it's this one oh it is good job look at this do you see the

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:33.600
last words theson that's from thesis you could say an organization Theon a Divine organization

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:39.360
Horas for us and there's your problem that's

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:45.120
not the cosmos that's not the cosmos no no no it's not

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.880
it's not sorry I'm Gonna Get You these backwards

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:57.539
look don't don't look at it so backwards oh I'm so sorry where's my

00:20:57.539 --> 00:21:02.880
it's in here somewhere isn't it nope I guess I didn't put that one in there

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.280
um the Horas is any time that is a cycle

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:14.100
okay think of the loop they um the Greeks were able to Envision a single

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:19.200
abstract concept of the completion of a cycle

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.900
the completion of a cycle that is the horror

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:32.039
you have 12 of these during the day did you know you completed 12 Cycles during the day no it's probably because you

00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:37.860
didn't also know that you complete 12 Cycles in a year right

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:44.280
um those horai are the Guardians those completed Cycles

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:51.059
are the sister Guardians of the gates of Uranus okay start and think right you're

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:56.820
sitting on your throne right until I didn't say it this time but everybody should be sitting on their throne

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:03.059
can you see those horai can you see them

00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:09.120
the completion of a circuit right this is

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.400
what I call gynecological time

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:20.659
it's the member of the species that can bring life from death

00:22:20.659 --> 00:22:25.679
that orders time not the masculine

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:31.820
isn't that interesting interesting okay so we're well buried

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:38.820
within a mystery right that has a feminine Foundation evangelicals here's a warning you're not

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:47.940
going to like this your cult is a late late development from a woman's science meant

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:54.299
to bring Salvation soteria to the world

00:22:54.299 --> 00:23:00.299
yeah thank female Physicians isn't it funny this whole time you've been worshiping a man

00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:08.640
when your entire art is based upon the work of female Physicians the Mysterion

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:15.260
is not a mystery like Sherlock Holmes needs to solve right it's an operation

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:22.740
and now we have the specifics and the drugs so we've got the go-ahead this is

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:27.900
the second half we're right at the pole this is the second half

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:34.140
so we're entering this phase of the initiation we go forward with the indictment

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:39.240
we go forward with the indictment good I want to read you a couple more images

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:45.539
here just to get you further you can see her you can see her being initiated

00:23:45.539 --> 00:23:52.500
she's already developed the drug the kufi's already burning the oils have already been added

00:23:52.500 --> 00:24:00.539
yes symbol of the living yes make himself long then you will see the gods looking

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:06.419
gracious upon you and no longer rushing you going about in

00:24:06.419 --> 00:24:11.520
their order of Affairs so when you see the world above as clear and circling

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.740
and that none of the gods or Angels is threatening you expect to hear a great

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:23.039
crash of thunder so as to shock you then say again silent

00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:29.520
silence and that's where we ended we got her to that point I want you to bring

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:36.179
her now to that final place of vision right I want you to go to that place

00:24:36.179 --> 00:24:43.080
that knocks out all the prophets right that causes them to right not her not

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:48.179
her this is this is gorgeous gorgeous

00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:53.880
when you have said this the Rays will turn towards you look at the center of

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:59.039
them for when you have done this you will see a youthful God beautiful in

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:04.799
appearance with fiery hair and in a white tunic and a Scarlet cloak and

00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:12.419
wearing a fiery crown at once greet him with the fire greeting

00:25:12.419 --> 00:25:20.220
oh isn't that nice you could see him you could see him ride everybody this is

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:26.640
Jesus this is Jesus you know coming in

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.940

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:42.240
oh my goodness here he is the Morning Star how nice how do we get here how did we

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.640

you had asked me I would give you living water

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:12.658
right there speaking of Baptists and evangelicals

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:19.020
we have to keep up we've got a clip tonight and I think the clip speaks for

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:26.400
itself it's just another co-conspirator and the long line of co-conspirators who have

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:33.110
sprung from Jesus Christ hit it chewing

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:37.540

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.779
yeah we're not here for that we're here to get to the bottom we're here to open up the reality we're here to find out

00:28:21.779 --> 00:28:28.020
what Jesus is doing with that naked kid yeah we want to see the rights we want

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:34.620
to know what was going on I'm offering you that view of the rights behind the

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:42.900
curtain all right this is with the temple doors open when the abomination of desolation

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:48.180
yeah the abomination of the eremosis

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:53.820
[Music] when the doubt and antidote sit in the

00:28:53.820 --> 00:29:00.179
temple you'll know Run to the Hills Run to the Hills bachats it's time for

00:29:00.179 --> 00:29:05.760
The Possession it's time for the Christ to come back yeah

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:11.700
what did I do what did I do the American Association

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.799
of University professors along with an international branch sent

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:22.500
members to my school my to St Mary's University

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:30.179
to investigate my firing they determined that I was terminated

00:29:30.179 --> 00:29:35.279
inappropriately that it was a matter of free speech

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:41.039
and not a matter of violating policy did I make people uncomfortable

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:48.299
there is an edge there is an edge to the reality

00:29:48.299 --> 00:29:54.299
there is an edge to the drugs that allows you

00:29:54.299 --> 00:30:02.840
to cut against the resistance the reality Burns

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:10.500
through the chasm it burns through that emptiness

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:17.059
yeah all for the sake of visualization all right

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.299

00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:01.260
that seed ultimately right the seed of God

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:10.399

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:16.760
mixture yeah it's not a simple mixture says Galen yeah it's not simply something that's taken out of the ground

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:22.080
yeah yeah nor is it something just Juiced he's saying this isn't one of the

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:28.380
simplest this goofy right this thing's a compound mixture compound mixture that's

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:36.299
right he says the Egyptians they call this thing they call this thing the decent Dante on

um let's say in the sake of a battle and an example of a battle right your

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:57.840
ability to keep off the enemy to protect that person all right can be your revenge

00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:02.099
compound yeah and it's used you know by the Egyptian priest Ryan they use it to

00:38:02.099 --> 00:38:07.859
Instagram baby they they they're experts in this stuff right

00:38:07.859 --> 00:38:13.920
and it's used as a mixture with antidotes so again I told you guys about

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.960
the dote antidote this kufi is standing

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:27.720
in the place of our theriac that we talked about before that we've got andromedicus from uh using right we've

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:34.519
got him with the formula for that right and he's got them from

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:41.460
I forget who what general it was a Pompey or something who got him from the East I can't remember but they come back

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:46.920
down to Nero through andromedicus and here we have yeah

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:53.700
um yeah so for the asthmatics he says it's given in a drink yeah yeah yeah and he says there's lots

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:58.920
of different preparations of it but most people use at least these this base

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:06.660
ingredient list and then he goes on and then he goes on and on

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:14.940
and with a list of ingredients now the mithridatic forms of this are way or way

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:20.040
longer and it's even plenty remarks on it and he said as has been noted

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:27.300
everybody knows this um it's ridiculous the these this list of ingredients is is too long right how

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:33.960
can you possibly make such a complex combo back then the contemporaries were

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:40.140
saying my God these drugs are advanced so think of us as we try to catch up

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:47.579
right we try to say wait a minute what are all these what are all these drugs doing in combo okay let's go up one more

00:39:47.579 --> 00:39:56.099
I want to show you a couple more texts um uh nope let's see no I can't it's too

00:39:56.099 --> 00:40:01.740
somebody too small anyway I wanted to focus in yeah

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:08.579
no that's fine um wasn't what I wanted let's go I want

00:40:08.579 --> 00:40:14.579
to go to a couple words here just to show you up um this was from uh just last time I

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:20.760
want to make sure you you caught this at the oystery is the um to go crazy right

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:27.060
so this is that phase that we're entering into and I want to give you a couple I had a couple look at The

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:32.460
Anatole what is that Rising that we're getting out of this Ceremony this is

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:40.380
what we're getting we're getting a rise we're getting that point at which the sun rises there's a reason we're we're

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:46.200
here look it it also means epitolay right fantastic so keep an eye on that

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:53.520
what is the apito lay the rising of a star yeah can also be the rising of wind so

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:58.619
for those of you who have ears to hear and you know that our

00:40:58.619 --> 00:41:04.740
cult is harnessing the winds you'll understand why she has to have seven

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:10.740
stars in her hand and he tells us in this text he tells us this is all about

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:17.400
the contritus right and what is that well here you can see it equals the Deep

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:22.859
sass right so there's something again about that deep SAS Venom that is

00:41:22.859 --> 00:41:29.339
involved in our right with our daughter it is a kentra4 it's something that

00:41:29.339 --> 00:41:35.460
carries with a sting right it's something that bears The Sting right

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:42.660
look at how poor fiery is it contain the center of the universe okay for those of

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:48.480
you with ears to hear you're going to enter into a state of Kentucky Mania

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:56.579
yeah what is something that's kentro manes that's something that's maddened by that kentron but look

00:41:56.579 --> 00:42:04.380
there's an association with the sexuality uh oh love is what makes you

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:09.420
mad love is what makes you mad and puts you into that state so that you can be

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:15.119
one of these kin three Adai these priests at Athens who drove an ox to an

00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:21.300
altar with the gods right these guys were the guys of the goads they were the

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:26.700
ones who goaded on right and what do we get with this thing

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.980
ultimately ending up being a membrane relay right

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:39.440
that post stays there for a reason okay because we're in that sexual right

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:46.260
fantastic fantastic okay bring him back

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:54.839
so I wanted you to see some of the images that are around we're in I want to go one more time and finish this uh

00:42:54.839 --> 00:43:01.800
mithras liturgy during a Bible study which we'll do next week the reason I wanted to do this is

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:08.160
um if you are able to put yourself in the performance of a mystery you can take

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:13.319
anything that a professor from an Ivy League school

00:43:13.319 --> 00:43:19.260
has said and you can shove it in a place where he's going to be

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:25.079
uncomfortable sitting on it and that's because you don't need the

00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:32.400
interpretation you need to see the actual right honestly love of all religions I've got

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:40.500
to say you've Hit Upon a real Central truth here what is the reason that we

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:49.740
are doing this what is the reason that that book is banned right if that

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:56.280
book is banned there's a reason we're here to find out what that reason

00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:02.400
is and to blow it up to see what it is so I've got a question for the

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:09.599
evangelicals the pace and I'll just preface this by saying the pace of Jesus's arrest and

00:44:09.599 --> 00:44:16.160
coming trans-dimensional trial um is

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:23.180
uh closing in on us right we will end with the indictment so

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:28.980
our investigation you know we're not here as judge jury and executioner Jesus

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:36.300
will have his day in trans-dimensional court what Warrior to do is to Bear witness

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:43.800
and testifies to who he was according to our evidence

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:49.619
my question to those of you who are evangelicals who are listening

00:44:49.619 --> 00:44:55.079
those of you who have not read the Bible but go around claiming that you have

00:44:55.079 --> 00:45:00.599
right um or claiming that I have some sort of

00:45:00.599 --> 00:45:05.940
Trauma from some sort of higher religious hierarchy I don't I'll tell

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:13.260
you my friends I I have there's a good chance that I have brought to eternal

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:19.800
life more people than you or anybody you know

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:26.339
um I have performed and had the privilege of being at the

00:45:26.339 --> 00:45:33.960
new birth um of those who were down and out those who

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:41.339
needed it those who needed the purgation came those who were desperate

00:45:41.339 --> 00:45:46.800
yes yes Mission work fantastic and I can tell

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:56.099
you to watch the death again from the rebirth is just as spectacular if not

00:45:56.099 --> 00:46:01.859
more spectacular so here's the question what was Jesus

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:07.020
doing with a naked kid in a public park I'm

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:13.619
asking you evangelicals Love of All religion I'm asking you dark witch lady

00:46:13.619 --> 00:46:20.160
uh dark witch I don't think cares but um those of you who do

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:26.119
who are born again those of you who have the indwelling of the holy spirit

00:46:26.119 --> 00:46:33.300
because you have believed the word of God because you

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:39.020
have committed your life to Christ because you

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:44.960
celebrate his holy day that your ancestors celebrated at that Sunrise

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:52.160
with the rising of him I would ask you

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:59.040
what is he doing with the naked kid in a public park

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:06.359
that's what we need to answer and I would invite all of you I've asked and I've asked a lot I've

00:47:06.359 --> 00:47:12.660
asked a lot of people and that's a lethal question you can really get into somebody's mind by exposing them to this

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:18.060
material so um that's what I would ask you and I want to start bringing some of your

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:26.220
answers forward what was Jesus doing with the naked boy in a public park what was Jesus doing with a naked boy in

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:33.020

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:34.579
with the future in the life of me uh

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:41.819
you know how many stars is in the universe so in my future is too many options my

00:48:41.819 --> 00:48:48.900
beauty is in my hands it's actually in my hands foreign

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:58.920
in all seriousness laughing of The Dalai Lama with the indwelling Buddha aside

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:05.940
after the kiss or the tongue suck me thing whatever that suck my tongue thing was

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:11.640
in all seriousness it's that kid that you and I are really working for

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:18.300
right the trans-dimensional District Attorney's office is the one

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:23.520
that's going to bring charges right on behalf of that

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:31.140
child that was with Jesus in the public park Jesus has gotten all of the press

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:37.020
right that kid is completely on the outside and if it were up to the Christians they would have buried them a

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:44.040
long time ago right and just gotten rid of them but we

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:52.260
because we fight for justice right we are pagans we still believe in

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:57.480
the goddess Justice and we need to fight for that kid that

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:02.819
wasn't we need to fight for this guy right and the long line of children that

00:50:02.819 --> 00:50:09.980
Jesus Christ and his followers have victimized it's a it's a fight it's a fight against

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:15.300
everything that is beautiful and it's the same fight that the Romans were

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:23.300
waging in the first century when the Christians burned down the city thank you for coming tonight

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:32.099
we will be forging ahead with another necromancy to follow we have to I'm told

00:50:32.099 --> 00:50:38.579
that because we're in the second half of the push toward the apocalypse that

00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:45.660
we have to speed things up now so I'm gonna have to start bringing in Witnesses and it might get ugly things

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:50.819
might get you know a little bit strange I need you to sit with me on that throne

00:50:50.819 --> 00:50:56.520
and I need us not to forget those Chaldean principles right the Chaldean

00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:03.839
principle of who you are you don't know who you are says Dionysus that's the problem you don't know who you are

00:51:03.839 --> 00:51:10.380
yeah we need to realize who we are we need to look into the mirror we need to

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:18.839
be well capable of that performance and in order to get there we're going to bring back the dead and uh it might be

00:51:18.839 --> 00:51:24.780
scary it might be scary it should be shouldn't any time that you bring that

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:32.220
you perform necromancy shouldn't it be a little bit a little bit across the plane please have your asterian stay on the

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:39.780
throne so that we can stay submerged in those deep things I appreciate your time

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:46.160
in honoring the Deep things of Satan and I say have a good night hail Satan
