being filled with that

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:47.720
natural power of the breath of Zoey the

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:56.800
the breath of life right you can translate the breath of life but you have to remember that Eve is called

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:28.160
this is not some bright light and this is not some entity pulsating invisible entity this is not no this is a dude in

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.320
a place where people acknowledge the existence of the

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.360
Gods I said that in the plural the existence of the

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:45.200
Gods human history is polytheism monism like Judaism

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.720
Christianity Islam those monest religions are

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:59.120
aberration of a polytheistic Cosmos yeah so what we're going to see

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.400
here in this verse is this Lord God who you think

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:10.200
is no dude it's a CIO you know how many Kuro there are in Antiquity there's a

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:17.120
whole bunch of them they're all over the place this is just a position you thought oh it's the Lord

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:23.799
from the void and the black speaks I

00:18:23.799 --> 00:18:30.520
li right oh my god do you know why why because you have

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:37.559
been injected with philosophy and theology right up your you know

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:42.960
what you've been injected with it for a long time it's time to take that out

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:48.720
it's time to get rid of that sunk that stuff out just pull it

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.760
out get it out evacuate get some kind of instrument

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.760

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:05.480
oh God it's so ridiculous does anybody else see the

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:13.159
ridiculous nature of this picture this dude never ever ever ever

00:19:13.159 --> 00:19:18.760
existed there is no text to support that dude

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:24.120
never sprinkle some kids around maybe a couple of teenagers make him touching

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:31.039
them and like a crowd in the background say hey stop touching those children and he's like then you'd be with the right

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:38.679
Jesus I don't know what that mess is look they all look like they have the plague that's what happens uh Neil's

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:46.520
gonna talk about that what happens when you suck the classic a well

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:54.240
dry what happens you get this look at this is this art even what is

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:59.520
that it's like everybody's dead I can't take it we got let's get

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.240
out of this sector quick let's go back to the text there's got to be something good in there at least something

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:13.360
something dirty or something something earthy you know what I mean don't be creepy about it and um what did he do

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:19.640
what did this individual do he put the man whom he had

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:25.760
educated into a paradise a uh a garden you can say Garden if you want to you

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:33.480
could say Garden into a paradise taste true face a paradise of

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:41.000
pleasure that's what the Greek says would you be surprised if I told you the Hebrew dropped this out completely show

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.159
me what the next slide is where did he put this dude he was educating him you knucklehead he was educating him and

00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:55.039
what did he do he put him where in a place of luxuriousness a place of wantedness I told you you need to be

00:20:55.039 --> 00:21:00.159
wanting tonight right you need to be wanting

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:07.159
do you see the anthropology that's behind the text do you see that's stuck in the language you can't get rid it's

00:21:07.159 --> 00:21:12.960
like every once in a while you smell an ancient fart and you're like oh God I

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:19.600
know right like you could you could partake of that again it's not to say there's anything

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:26.200
bad about them the smellers give me the next one um here's the Hebrew just in

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:32.720
case if there's anybody now remember why would the Hebrew lie now look there's

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.000
nothing go ahead and search it

00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:02.520
you it's Jehovah told was Jehovah here we are are you

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.400
ready calm down Yahoo look who's got Authority here Genesis 2:15 in the

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:14.880
Hebrew and look at it and see are you going to find any sort of Garden of pleasure there are you going to find any

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:21.720
wanting people there no okay then stop all the scholars pull back your pull

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:29.679
your pants back up okay guard yourselves this is supposed to be the

00:22:29.679 --> 00:22:35.400
Hebrew that was the original that the Greek was translated from and you're

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:41.360
telling me the Greek dudes or the rabbis they

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:47.760
said it was 70 rabbis who did this right um that they they all got the same words

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:53.080
and I don't worry they were in different cells it was all hoo-ha booha religious

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:58.240
ceremony and what happens you know that's the story none of us buy that right the Romans are standing around

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:05.760
look at I'm like oh I I got to go somewhere you going to hurry this thing up so they that's what the we're

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:12.919
supposed to believe if this Hebrew was the original what did the Greek dude or

00:23:12.919 --> 00:23:20.000
the the translator do what did he do to just pull something out of thin air do

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.240
you know that's not common to just pull Concepts out of thin air when you're

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.679
translating you you have to have some basis you have to have some rational

00:23:32.679 --> 00:23:38.000
basis for making a word what it is dropping it now if this is a Greek

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.679
translation of the Hebrew then the translation is in error because that's

00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:50.279
not in the Hebrew and here's the rational conundrum that kills second century

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:56.840
Judaism yeah the religion this is a religion killer are you hearing what I'm saying

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:02.960
it's an antichrist it's a it's an antidote it's an antidote this text is

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:09.360
supposed to be originally Hebrew but the Greek translation

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:15.799
supposed hasn't a word there that's not there's not even a whiff of it in the in

00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:21.320
the text it's an invented it's just a pop just pop it in there just yeah

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:28.880
totally falsify it right um so you tell me you tell me is this that or or is

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:35.399
this the case that the Greek is the original that the original makes sense the way it does and is beautifully

00:24:35.399 --> 00:24:42.679
fluently Greek ancient Greek it's gorgeous um and that the

00:24:42.679 --> 00:24:48.760
Hebrew translators were sitting around saying oh my God how are we going to

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:56.480
translate this how are we going to translate this they only have 7,000 words people they got barely enough for

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.720
breakfast right now you confront what's odd is you

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:08.039
confront you confront biblical Scholars about that and they just be goes and if

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:13.440
they have to answer something for it they'll make something crazy up they'll

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:19.759
make something crazy up no vows man language was no

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:29.640
vows did I fool you yeah the devil fooled me the devil fooled me I drank

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:35.720
the stuff next thing you know I got twins Give me the give me the

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:42.200
next passage we got to show people what's going on at this at this mystery party right remember we're invisible so

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:48.480
it doesn't matter you can't see stuff and touch stuff without you know and heard it uh look at verse

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.840
16 the this cuos commanded Adam he told

00:25:53.840 --> 00:26:00.039
him he said look in this place you can take of all all the trees you want

00:26:00.039 --> 00:26:07.760
except for the one that is the tree that brings the knowing the knowing what the

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:14.440
knowing what is kalon and Pon that which is beautiful good and

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:20.919
that which is not beautiful or good right and he says look and when you eat

00:26:20.919 --> 00:26:29.120
from it when you partake in it what's going to happen to you you're G to die

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:34.919
by means of death and you think well that sounds like a weird way that sounds

00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:40.039
like a weird way is it a natural to die of death is there any other way that you're going to be dying of

00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:50.520
death if you take this it will kill you it is a death

00:26:52.120 --> 00:27:00.480
inducer what did the devil tell Eve right he said that Jack is a liar

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:07.159
that cuos is lying and remember remember he's still the best looking he's best

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:13.399
looking around period period his job there is to guard the

00:27:13.399 --> 00:27:22.080
tree is to guard the tree huh okay you is there anything in that

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:27.480
tree is there anything in that tree would anybody be surprised if there was

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:35.760
an association between that skin of the Lamb that Ram skin that Lamb of God that

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:41.880
lamb skin of God would anybody be surprised of course no at this point you

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:49.919
wouldn't what is going on the dudes in the thir Century who wrote and people

00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:55.399
I'm GNA tell you this and I don't care if it takes you 20 years to prove this

00:27:55.399 --> 00:28:01.399
right the the Book of Genesis that we're reading from was written by the same

00:28:01.399 --> 00:28:07.080
dude that wrote Isaiah

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:12.240
job and um the other

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:19.919
one Psalms Psalms and you say oh Preposterous okay line up your Dan

00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:26.000
DuckTales Dan line them up are you ready are you ready for a linguistic

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.279
analysis to show you that this thing is a forged history it's a forged history

00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:37.519
written in the 3 century and they are using the Greek is

00:28:37.519 --> 00:28:45.360
a base it's originally in Greek they're using the Greek culture to mount their

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:52.120
mystery to mount their monism yeah fantastic it's almost like a

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:57.720
parasite monest religions and when I say monest for the people who um maybe just

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:05.880
join a monest religion is one that worships a single Divinity to the exclusion of all

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:11.720
others to the exclusion of all others monism is like a

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:19.399
virus and you can see it from as ancient Egypt you know all the way up to

00:29:19.399 --> 00:29:27.240
2024 you can see the virus and how it works to pull down the systems of

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.720
Justice that polytheism naturally tends

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:40.240
toward yeah you mean in polytheism there is a natural Justice yes in polytheism

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:46.200
there is a nature to watch and there is a nature from which you can gain Insight

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:54.440
you can watch a mother give birth and what does that teach you from nature bonehead that's not a that's not a faith

00:29:54.440 --> 00:30:00.519
it's not a Creed and it's not something you can you can get from a seminarian or

00:30:00.519 --> 00:30:08.200
a teacher or somebody on YouTube when you worship that nature

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:14.000
this is what you get you get that paradise you get that paradise and

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:22.240
that's what they're building here this curios this Lord right just happens to

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:30.080
be the one who is taking Adam and finishing his education

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:37.120
by bringing him through this ride he pulled her from his side now if you're

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:43.679
sitting around oh and you've never seen that expression used anywhere else I'll tell you right now as a

00:30:43.679 --> 00:30:50.600
classicist um um Jesus is doing the same thing when he goes up and

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:57.000
masturbates and then offers it to Mary for lunch in the in the woods in his

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:06.120
private place yeah yeah same concept it's a cult right

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:12.039
right it's a cult right so remember we're at this party and we've got Adam and Eve and Lucifer Adam and Eve and

00:31:12.039 --> 00:31:18.240
Lucifer give me the next one give me the next one okay what's GNA happen are you ready for the cult you thought this

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.840
stuff was fairy tale didn't you no um what did the cuos do he brought about or

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.960
he made a boon for his Adam

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:34.760
what is a boon a boon is

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:40.320
somebody who rides next to you in

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:47.960
battle a boon or Boos in the nominative that is a person who comes up

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:55.080
with a shield on Your Flank that is

00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:01.159
what he was getting now where is he going to get one of these that he can

00:32:01.159 --> 00:32:06.600
take from the side of the Adamas the one who is made

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:14.600
Invincible right it's like you know you you come of age and your daddy takes you out and you do some things and this

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:20.799

Boop okay there is a sophistication please

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:46.440
remember that you are reading Greek and there is a sophistication to it that you

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:52.720
cannot approximate without the original you're talking about you're getting the

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:58.159
third grade you're getting the third grade reading of it

00:32:58.159 --> 00:33:03.360
okay and what the Greek is is the Greek is the adult version so it's Gonna Hurt

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:10.639

00:33:36.919 --> 00:33:42.399
AA right they couldn't get her that's what they're waiting for that's what

00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:51.519
they're moving through the creation for is this aa oh nice it's a interesting

00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:58.639
picture of what the person who's writing this in the thir century is using as

00:33:58.639 --> 00:34:05.880
their historical models it's gorgeous it's absolutely gorgeous now watch this it's going to betray she's going to show

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:11.878
she's Amazonian she's gonna show her syian roots in just a second if people

00:34:11.879 --> 00:34:19.040
didn't know that Eve was cyan and they actually called her scua um here you go

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:25.398

00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:31.520
people right where's the third guy bringing the third guy in there he's in there somewhere I don't know who was who

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:37.839
was on that cover I'm not sure oh um so let's get back to the right and we're

00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:43.240
we're what's the first thing that happens give me the text give me the

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:49.398
text the first thing that happens before any of this has come to pass before this

00:34:49.399 --> 00:34:56.040
right right we're sitting here now watching it boom boom boom and we've got Eve we've got Adam we've got the devil

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:03.400
boom boom boom and I swear to you I put that poison Sweat Right In Her Cup right

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:10.440
you know what I mean that was what I was supposed to do right so here we are at that party boom boom boom what happened

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:16.119
before this I hate when movies do this but I'm gonna do this because I'm moving

00:35:16.119 --> 00:35:25.000
backwards what happened before this before this God stoned

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.079
Adam what do you mean he stoned him he stoned him he blitzed him he took him and scrambled his brain he threw him

00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:41.040
into ecas he threw him into ecstasy and Adam went into this

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:50.040
stuper ecas what kind is that where we get our word ecstasy it sure is it sure

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:57.359
is that's okay keep going it's where we get our word ecstasy now what do you think do you

00:35:57.359 --> 00:36:03.440
think that there's a Hebrew word for ecstasy no it turns out there isn't all

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:09.960
the Hebrew says is it put him to sleep you can see they were like okay these weren't dummies these people who are

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:15.920
writing the they were just bad translator well you can't even say they were bad translators they were working

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:21.880
with 7,000 words if you only had 7,000 words and that's what the average

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:29.400
vocabulary of I think it was seveny old if that's

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:36.440
vocabulary um you're not going to have words in it like ecstasy I appreciate that so what do the people do they just

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:42.400
went oh okay here there's no Hebrew word for ecstasy so instead of that we'll put

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:49.079
the word sleep and that's what they did they put the word sleep and your

00:36:49.079 --> 00:36:54.680
translations into English will reflect that

00:36:54.680 --> 00:37:01.839
lie that lie there was no ecstasy what are you talking about they just put him to sleep they just put him to sleep

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:07.160
do you see how that obscures the reality because if they've got exstasy going on

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:13.480
they've got some kind of ritual some kind of drug to induce the Ecstasy oh

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:18.800
God and there's a billion we could choose from right so especially if our

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:25.079
dude who's writing this is living in the third century and he's got all the Mysteries

00:37:25.079 --> 00:37:31.520
to choose from goody good good oh God it's gorgeous people who didn't

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:37.000
realize now some people some people didn't realize that

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:45.520
Judaism is a creation of the third second you know I would say you have to include the

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:52.880
third right but um second first centuries BC it really gets going first

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:59.880
century second century that monism of Judaism Jews were not originally monis

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:07.200
yeah it turns out they're all from CR yeah or at least that's one of the places that they migrated from over to

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:13.280
what you and I call Palestine or Israel right yeah that's not it's not like an

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:20.680
amazement to them in Antiquity right so that by the time this document is being written you've got to

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:25.720
realize there is no Moses right he's a fiction Moses is a

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:30.920
fiction not only that but it's a bad bad it's a bad use of you know I don't know

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:38.200
maybe they ran out of they ran out of pizza that night or something in Alexandria right they ran out they

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:45.319
crashed and they just couldn't come up so they were just like oh just take just take museus right he did the same thing

00:38:45.319 --> 00:38:51.800
just make him Moses just write him in it's like maybe there were a group maybe it was a group of writers and maybe

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:57.560
these writers were not so good right these are not if you put Genesis the the

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:07.200
Book of Genesis next to Homer Homer Will Make You Weep I have

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:13.000
seen people weep publicly right like a really good movie

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.400
reading Homer the differences in the um the

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.440
differences in the style are laughably you know

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:30.280
from again people it's third grade stuff it's third great seven don't blame just

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:35.720
this just this attempt you know it's really an insult the creation of the

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:41.520
Torah was an insult to Judaism because they already had the Greek which had

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:48.599
much more beautiful detail it was very heady Judaism was born in

00:39:48.599 --> 00:39:54.359
Alexandria it didn't come out of Egypt it didn't come out of

00:39:54.359 --> 00:39:59.319
Syria it didn't come out out of Palestine

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:04.839
no no uh no it was born from

00:40:04.839 --> 00:40:10.640
Alexandria by people who had been speaking Greek for a long time by people

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:18.800
who had a lurgical language for which we have nothing left over nothing

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:24.000
everything Hebrew scholarship ancient Hebrew scholarship is based on is based

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:33.319
on a Greek text yeah so we have to look at the reality

00:40:33.319 --> 00:40:40.920

her out of Adam are you ready how are we going to do that you'll

00:43:06.359 --> 00:43:11.960
see you'll see so what does the serpent say he says to the woman not with death

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:19.240
you're not going to die with death right because God knows keep going

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:26.880
what does this cuos know he knows in the day you eat from it your eyes are going

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:34.359
to to be open and you are going to be Hosto you're going to be like Gods now

00:43:34.359 --> 00:43:40.079
you say to yourself wait a minute the Bible acknowledges the existence of gods

00:43:40.079 --> 00:43:47.280
yes why is that kitties it's because it's written in a time when the people

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:54.960
acknowledged the existence of many gods and here is God and the devil and

00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:00.599
Eve in a little struggle about who's saying what's what the devil

00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:08.839
says look you're going to you're not going to die right I'll give you the thimone did

00:44:08.839 --> 00:44:16.599
you realize the Devil is a Christ did you realize that

00:44:16.599 --> 00:44:22.000
right I will give you the death inducer and it won't kill

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.640
you okay right he just doesn't want

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:34.240
you to see the world like he does

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:24.800
that's okay that's okay we're back right so here is the

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.880
devil right proving proving that God is a

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:36.960
liar just like the people who took the Greek and created a fake Hebrew from a

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:46.480
dead language that only had 7,000 words that is a Lie the devil from the

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:51.680
very beginning has been one who has towed the

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:57.960
line when it came to that lie don't lie right don't lie

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:04.359
this is the devil's Kingdom right he knows he knows fantastic beautiful

00:46:04.359 --> 00:46:11.680
portrait right beautiful portrait the Bible disproving itself the Torah disproving itself because if the Torah

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:17.640
is the original and it doesn't have a completed set of words it doesn't have

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:22.039
the concepts that are on the Greek

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:28.839
side yeah yeah what are you going to do it was wasn't good enough did you know the

00:46:28.839 --> 00:46:34.680
text itself acknowledges and the person who's speaking is God this is in I think

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:42.960
it's either Isaiah or Ezekiel I'm pretty sure it's Isaiah he says look I'm not GNA send you to a bunch of people of an

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:49.880
advanced language I'm going to send you to the people of

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:55.640
Israel right so the text itself

00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:02.720
acknowledges the weakness of Hebrew right and not not to mention it

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:08.400
sounds like an insult from somebody in the third Century whose Greek was strong

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:16.599
and they were on the side of prog Greek right people think that Judaism was a reaction you know the the helenistic uh

00:47:16.599 --> 00:47:21.800
Rebellion against the Greek was you know that was what was Jewish no there were

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:28.760
lots of Jews who were plenty happy to be stuck with he with Greek and with that

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:35.640
old dead language being just a part we didn't even put that in our synagogues people I talked to bring him up one more

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:41.160
time I talked to Gnostic today and he reminded me he reminded me he said you

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:48.559
know um is Jezreel the Jezreel Valley has that kabut there with the vineyard

00:47:48.559 --> 00:47:53.760
hey hey buddy the jez we'll pretend he's here we'll Pretend We're pretending

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:58.839
Gnostic is here hey hey gnostic

00:47:58.839 --> 00:48:05.240
um we were talking about the Jaz real Valley I just wanted to tell the satanic congregation we were talking about this

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:12.880
jez real Valley and I live there I happen to live there and um I used to ride horses all over the place I was

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:20.280
that guy and um I loved it absolutely loved it um but wait what why did I even

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:27.240
start here look what you did Neil look what you did you knocked it right out of my brain it'll come back to me come back

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:35.280
to me stop quick chewy divert him get him to the next get him to the next slide Don't Run Away people how

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:41.880
unprofessional I don't understand how this person operates give me the next one here we go are you ready people

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:49.880
What's it gonna happen um and I yeah yeah um and the woman okay here's

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:56.000
Eve what did she see she saw that this tree was good for the sake of consumption right this looks like

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.480
something good right it's you know look good to her eyes right it's useful right

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:07.240
it's this Fruity Fruity fruit thing right it's Orion do you see that word

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:12.880
Orion that's fruity that's fruity like coming Pop there's a fruit oh it's

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:18.720
gorgeous right um that's how it's described so she took it she took it and

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:24.880
she ate it you know because he told her you're not going to die you're not going to die and what happened now

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:32.839
remember um something that is is kicking in is analogia analogia you're going to sense

00:49:32.839 --> 00:49:39.680
a strain of oracular writings here the

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:46.319
author of this work of Genesis who is undoubtedly same dude that wrote Isaiah

00:49:46.319 --> 00:49:56.359
definitely right um this dude is now creating a world that reflects the

00:49:56.359 --> 00:50:02.760
things that are going on around it right and

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:09.359
um uh what are they doing in the Mysteries they're using a Vox they're

00:50:09.359 --> 00:50:15.720
using a voice so you're going to have to look for that voice here and it shows up it

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:21.680
shows up all over the place right and shows up here she ate of that thing

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:26.920
right and she gave it to him and he ate of it do you understand eat them My

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:33.480
Flesh drink of my blood right um they are entering these ecstatic States

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:41.520
through these processes that involve the Botanicals that involve all sorts of

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:46.960
compounds and so here we are we finally have this woman here and now we have a

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:52.880
choice we have a choice between this glorious Amazonian Queen and you're

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:59.040
going to know she's an Amazonian because I'm going to show you God reveals it he lets it slip she's an Amazonian give me

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:03.160
the next one give me the next

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:15.720
one are we okay little interference there what is the tree that's the I

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:22.280
think we skipped over one but that's okay I can go from here what is the tree what is it doing by the way for those of

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:28.599
you who are just like wait a minute he's just talk he just talking about drugs right Christ Christ is a drug term but

00:51:28.599 --> 00:51:36.400
yeah yeah I am talking drugs and what is it that that tree did the one that God said don't eat it'll kill you right

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:42.839
which he didn't really say right he said it'll put it'll kill

00:51:42.839 --> 00:51:50.240
you via thos yeah right devil said no what is

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:58.160
that tree do that he told you not to partake of it's the tree that causes you to have

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:04.680
K noo to be to exercise it's a verb to exercise K

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:11.839
noo yeah what is that Che give me that tell me what k no

00:52:11.839 --> 00:52:17.599
is to be in one's right mind or to be in

00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:24.559
one's senses do you know what that thing will do it'll reset

00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:30.599
you and you will know know you will

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:37.839
know yeah that's what it's all about that tree and the access to that tree is

00:52:37.839 --> 00:52:45.359
what creates the Adas this is all cult mystery cult and it makes perfect sense

00:52:45.359 --> 00:52:53.359
that it's being created in the third Century there is no Moses Judaism is a Greek

00:52:53.359 --> 00:52:59.440
invention yeah not a modern Greek invention because the language has deteriorated to

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:06.559
such an extent but the ancient Greeks yeah like plethon let's bring it

00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:13.599
back let's bring it back give me the next one um this is I just wanted to show you this is the uh now how do you

00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:21.040
translate that into Hebrew you can't really right you have to just G get some

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:27.559
generalized word like knowledge right knowledge knowing under premeditation

00:53:27.559 --> 00:53:33.599
look how that's kind of shotgun down there with skill and Truth seriously right well they have to do that with the

00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:39.119
ancient Hebrew a lot sometimes you know one of these Hebrew words is not right

00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:44.640
it can't be what they're talking about because you read two books earlier that it was something

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:51.520
else right and they do Unfortunately they do this and that this is one of those occasions for them to do it you

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:58.359
can't say ecstasy so you say sleep you can't say aate of mental

00:53:58.359 --> 00:54:03.480
soundness a state of mental health you have to say

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:09.119
knowledge right this is not about knowledge this is about a right and

00:54:09.119 --> 00:54:15.599
these three people who are going through it yeah and AOS who's going to get mad

00:54:15.599 --> 00:54:22.079
and is going to reveal his own hand by showing the Amazonian who is Eve give me

00:54:22.079 --> 00:54:27.319
the next one let's let's get to it we only have a couple more and

00:54:27.319 --> 00:54:33.760
what's going to happen and your eyes right the eyes so he said um this that's what they said was going to happen they

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:40.359
ended up eating it and what happens their eyes were opened I just wanted to show you that he wasn't lying the devil

00:54:40.359 --> 00:54:46.400
was right God was lying and what happened they understood that they were

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:52.760
naked they understood that

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:58.319
nakedness yeah yeah

Paradise why did they do that why do they hide themselves the dude is walking

00:55:46.839 --> 00:55:53.000

around that tree that tree that causes you to come

00:56:55.559 --> 00:57:01.799
to that place of complete and total health it involves getting

00:57:01.799 --> 00:57:09.559

helper right again do you hear the third grade right this is not the warrior this

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:40.319

01:04:18.839 --> 01:04:25.720
from the Hebrew um this is very much and they love doing this right this repetition is extremely common it's us

how this was in the minds of the people that made your Moses and your

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:51.640
Jesus right when Jesus is going around doing the stuff that he's doing where do you think he's getting all of these

ideas he goes down to Alexandria he goes down to Egypt and he comes back and all the

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:05.560

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:19.760
armpit check it check out the archaeology it's an armpit it's a place it's a place on the

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:25.960
road you know what I mean you're on the interstate that's all and it's

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:33.880
you know it's not a big deal the Romans hated it they had to come in and build toilets so people would

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:41.880
poop without tromping around in it seriously do you think that the language

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:48.320
that is developed in this place they're still stoning each other

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:55.320
publicly right what do you think the Roman Governor thought of this it's Barbarian dude what are they doing do

01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:04.000
you think that their language do you think that the language that produced this Society archaeologically

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:11.080
what do you think of it are they going to be leaving a lot of stuff in the dirt the Scrolls and what nope they aren't

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:18.880
they found one pot a couple of pots in one cave kumran and they thought oh my God

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:25.239
we have a literate Society no man there is no Hebrew it's

01:12:25.239 --> 01:12:33.159

01:12:33.159 --> 01:12:39.960
Greek and reading Greek works and getting oh so high on those lovely

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:46.120

Greek it gets my goat when people step forward and

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:06.360
deceive and deceive and tell you this goes back to the

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:13.840
Hebrew no it doesn't the word Messiah is never there it's never there it's Christ

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:20.400
you keep translating as Messiah because people through history

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:27.560
bombarded bombarded governments and created their own

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:33.000
legitimacy but the language in these texts they never stop they're always

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.960
going to be there and it gets my goat Penelope it gets her when you don't

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:44.440

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:52.360

totally obsessed with it as if it is itself the performance of a

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:24.920
