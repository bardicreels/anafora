00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.400
Jesus and his naked boy and his title

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.400
Christ people are now looking at it why is that so important it's

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.879
important because they're meat fresh meat okay let's go to this first let's

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.760
go to this first um clip and before we do I just want to set this up for

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.080
you um I want you to think of the back alley you're in the back alley it's too

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.040
late it's too late you're in the back alley and here are the back alley

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.720
artists and they're going to give it to you cuz you trust them are you ready are

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.640

certain young man having a linen cloth cast about his naked body and the young

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.319

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.120

this evil horrible pedophilia practices and they're getting their ideas from what Jesus taught in the New Testament

like it's glowing or something yes is that what you thought

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:31.799
it meant that's not what the text says baby I got bad harsh news for

00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:40.159
you he was doing a right that other people were doing he was performing the mystery and you can't say that it wasn't

00:33:40.159 --> 00:33:47.240
concurrent it wasn't actually happening because the New Testament authors themselves say it was

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:52.799
happening yeah have you ever sat on the throne of

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:58.240
Satan you know there's a mystery of iniquity

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:03.960
and it's already at work that's what they

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:11.320
said that's what they said you want to see the mystery of iniquity you want to see the Christ let me show you give it

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:17.560
to me give it to me give it to me the next one um what's one of the things okay we're getting ready Jesus is

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:23.679
getting ready to go into his death cult and he's going to be put into death what's one of the tools they got around

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:28.800
them look at that third word the alabastron right the

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:34.720
asron and what is that it's a very well-known tool it's in Antiquity it's a

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:44.000
dildo that carries the muron or the combination of the oils and Botanicals

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.638
that are used in sex rights and by rights I don't just mean it your local

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:58.640
church or your synagogue or your temple I don't mean those kind of sex rights I mean the ones that you do in the bedroom

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:03.920
the Greeks have been using this for a long time don't you know you get oiled

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:11.520
up with the aphrodesiac first and it's conveniently

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:19.560
shaped so that it can it can be applied and they rub it why do they rub

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:28.760
it they remove the oil and they rub it which the Christians always translate as break right like you got the perfume bam

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:34.599
I got to get into the perfume well what do you mean I got to break it open to get into it that's how they that's how

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:41.200
they picture it that's how they translate it like I got like Jesus sitting there Mary magdalene's got this

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.320
vial that she can't open so he's like bam and then what the hell the the

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:52.680
ointments all over the place you idiot go to Aristophanes you can see how it's

00:35:53.160 --> 00:36:00.960
used it's amazing so Jesus has already had his alabastron and why did Mary give

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:07.240
him the alabastron it's drugs pay look what I

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:12.520
look at the next one look at the next one and by the way it pissed people off

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:19.119
and they said um Jesus said what's this you know you got some kind of grief you

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:24.680
got some kind of beef with the lady he's talking to his students you got because

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:31.560
they're like ah you got some kind of a beef with her give it to me why' she do this people

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:37.599
now I'm going to read the Bible for you for the first time you evangelicals here it comes I'm going to read it to you for

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:44.040
the first time she took that myrr right and what happened he says she put it all

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:49.760
over my body for the sake of what for the sake of

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:55.640
inasi in order to put me in to the death

00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:03.760
state he's already started the mystery ritual

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:10.920
of pasca okay he's got the

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:20.079
drugs on board at this point he is being

00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:25.359
christed are you the Christ you notice that it's in the gospels they don't ask

00:37:25.359 --> 00:37:33.359
are you the Messiah because that is fake they ask in the Greek are you the

00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:40.599
Christ yeah the whole Messiah narrative is later and it's fake it is a

00:37:40.599 --> 00:37:48.760
reinal bastardization and delegitimization of the Greek texts that

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:54.599
are the Torah yes and it's all in the language

00:37:54.599 --> 00:38:01.000
it's all in the language people we had it the time what the hell what the hell

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.359
it's because things happen if you ever talk to the

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:13.480
Oracle you'll find out that things happen chronologically and that they can be

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:20.040
engineered some things to be covered up and some things to be

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:28.400
revealed what are we doing now we are revealing that Beast we are bringing

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:34.680
that right back to you which is exactly what our bantine monk

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:41.880
said we bring the [Music] Antichrist the antidote the antidote for

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:48.480
Jesus isn't that weird the antidote for Jesus is seeing what's actually going

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:54.280
on okay it feels good doesn't it with the anthropology every time you get one

saying this is hypocrates and this oh this is just an aside look we pop back

00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:59.359
in time back to fifth century we're going to look at some fifth century type medicine influenced by the ionians being

00:57:59.359 --> 00:58:05.440

00:58:12.599 --> 00:58:17.640
the year and he says this year we had these diseases and this year he says the

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:24.720

ausi they are blooming

00:58:53.799 --> 00:58:59.359
blooming okay set that in your brain and what does that bottom line say these are

00:58:59.359 --> 00:59:06.599
the types of people who spend time at the palra and the gymnasia what are they

00:59:06.599 --> 00:59:12.119
they're the schools the public

00:59:12.119 --> 00:59:20.359
schools do you know where Jesus gets his Apostles from public

00:59:20.359 --> 00:59:26.200
schools that's why he calls his students children

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:32.480
again it's the age between 10 to 12ish and up to uh later

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:40.240
teens right and by the way people say uh St Peter was married no no no he wasn't

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:45.440
he wasn't right it's one word for sister-in-law right and mother-in-law

it's the same word he's probably his brother's wife yeah is say cuz why how

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:58.240
can I be so sure because there's no other evidence of a freaking wife

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:05.880
anywhere right and it doesn't fit that he's married at such a young

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:12.240

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:54.280
bloom and following when what are these people doing they're usually working

01:00:54.280 --> 01:01:03.160
with someone specifically to learn it's a form of Education or

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:10.559
pidea okay remember nobody's been speaking Hebrew here for hundreds of years right we've all been speaking

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.480
they looked at it as blooming I told you I told you overwhelming majority of

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:02.760
these people are involved in one way or another with

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:08.960
agriculture okay fantastic we cannot forget that a fee we're talking about a

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:17.119
fees do you understand Christians do you understand when it's translated as a disciples do you

01:02:17.119 --> 01:02:22.960
understand we're talking about students

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:33.960
Jesus is doing everything he's doing as a Christos with the appropriate 12

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:40.920
children appropriate for the rights right Paul does the same thing he has to go out and get 12 too why is it why do

house okay all right stuff has to be followed

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:15.079
there's prescriptions for this these drugs are crazy crazy complicated and

01:03:15.079 --> 01:03:21.000
dangerous the whole process of putting yourself into death and being raised

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.400
again into new life that entire mystery

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:32.720
is a very very regulated

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:39.000
process okay otherwise you can end up dead bro you can end up dead and Jesus

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.359
is like handing out the poison right everybody knows that Jesus Christ if you don't know go look at Mark chapter 16

01:03:47.359 --> 01:03:53.319
Jesus Christ is handing out the death poison to people right everybody knows that did

01:03:53.319 --> 01:03:59.920
anybody say that to any of evangelicals that tried to poison their minds did you

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:08.319
tell them that what about Jesus handing out death drugs huh Jim Jones did and everybody

01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:14.400
made a big deal out of that what about Jesus because Jesus's drugs bring you

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:20.599
back baby they bring you back you know you can so you know they

01:04:20.599 --> 01:04:27.799
have the technology let me just say this for the conspiracy people out there I want to tell you tell you one thing

01:04:27.799 --> 01:04:34.680
about Jesus Christ Jesus Christ hung on a cross and

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:43.319
died before he was supposed to the only injury he was given beside the

01:04:43.799 --> 01:04:51.520
beating was the sword in the side the Javelin in the side and what happened

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:57.680

01:16:51.159 --> 01:16:59.560
drive to stop those involved in the trade we have trafficking right now

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:07.920
where people are drugged and put into sexual situations and dominated by the drugs manipulated by

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:14.800
the drugs do you think this is a new invention the Romans wanted to put a

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:20.440
stop to it this Christian guy said oh it was GE it was the Christians they're the

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:25.520
ones who stomped all the Pasty they're the no they aren't they are not the ones

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:33.000
who stop the pedasi and I can give you example after example after example of Christians being put into jail for

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.239
sexually abusing children okay in what in

01:17:39.239 --> 01:17:47.040
rights Christian rights all right so yeah I'm sorry for

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:53.520
the Christians out there I'm sorry I'm very sorry that you know the reality has

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:59.000
to be this way but we have to be true to those texts right we have to follow those texts give

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:06.360
me the next one let's hurry let's get through this right so that Neil can come on oh God here no let's keep going we

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:11.960
did that one here go to the next one go to the next one get up let's go yeah

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:18.800
yeah we're getting betrayed right right keep going keep going he was thanking there the yeah we caught up we caught up

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.880
so in at that time Jesus this is when Jesus says to the crowd of people that

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:30.520
showed up notice that it says Matthew uses the word OS right a crowd it's not

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:38.960
just a crowd like Taylor Swift fans right it's a mob a pissed off

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:47.560
mob and most of them are armed even the ones that aren't SWAT are

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:54.000
armed do you realize that when Jesus Christ was arrested he was arrested in a

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.960
raid and guess who they were rounding up they

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.239
were rounding up

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.520
traffickers they were giving rewards for

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:18.199
traffickers uhuh Julius Caesar had just done his thing he had

01:19:18.199 --> 01:19:25.360
just done his thing trying to clean up the Mediterranean from the fraking traffickers that kidnapped him

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:31.080
sons of okay okay what does Jesus say to the

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:36.400
Mob he says look you think I'm a

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:40.480
lay you think I'm a

01:19:43.679 --> 01:19:51.120
trafficker it's not me making it up it's coming right out of the the text itself

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:56.239
these are your text Christians and I'm not going to give them back and so yeah

01:19:56.239 --> 01:20:02.480
um They Crucified him what does it say they crucified him and with him there

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:09.400
were Duo Ley there were Duo Ley and how are they

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:16.679
crucified they put one on one side and one on the other they lined these guys

01:20:16.679 --> 01:20:27.120
up they lined these traffickers of the human soul up these AB users of humanity

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:33.679
and they were so pissed that they prefer that Jesus get crucified to a dude who

01:20:33.679 --> 01:20:40.120
had killed someone yeah to a dude who had killed

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:46.800
someone there was great hatred for Jesus Christ for a reason you were supposed to

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:55.440
see the crucifixion for what it was instead you preferred your greed

01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.480
you wanted that life you didn't want to die and go to hell did you you didn't

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:06.199
want to die and go to hell to my friend out there who said enjoy hell idiot you

01:21:06.199 --> 01:21:12.159
don't want to die and go to hell Right the dude who was there was a

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:17.480
creepe give me the next one we're almost done we're almost done Neil and um yeah

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:23.920
here's just another one and those there those crucified there are those crucified lace D but what I just want

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:31.639
you to know notice what they're doing they derided

01:21:32.159 --> 01:21:38.840
Jesus what he had done was so bad they derided

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:44.400
him they derided him because there's different you know there's wh when

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:50.480
you're involved in trafficking you know you can always just sell the person off to somebody who's who's going to you

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:57.760
know she's going to fetch a high price for a bride somewhere you just take her to the bride market right you don't have

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:04.239
to do PCA you don't have to do PCA and I think

01:22:04.239 --> 01:22:09.800
that the derision of those other traffickers

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:16.199
around him I think that says a lot about that angry mob I think it says a lot

01:22:16.199 --> 01:22:21.920
even the Roman soldiers were giving it to them right you

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:28.000
know give me the next one giving the next and what does it say what does it

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:36.639
say oh the temple so Jesus he gives up right he gives up the ghost right he he

01:22:36.639 --> 01:22:43.639
yields his life and what does this say the temple curtain was ripped in

01:22:43.639 --> 01:22:49.880
half right and what happened there was an earthquake the Earth

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:55.800
shook ready now you want of the zombies just wait the Earth shook

01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:02.080
Shook and the stones were broken right we've got tombs

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:11.280
that are made of stone and when Jesus is up there he cries out ah and he says sabach thone the holy

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:16.719
God he's crying out am man he's crying

01:23:16.719 --> 01:23:22.840
out to that Divinity in whose mystery he is and remember he's saying crazy stuff

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:31.040
he wouldn't answer any questions at point right and what happens he's screaming and all of a sudden the Earth

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:40.400
shakes and the tombs crack open and what happens give me the next one what happens here they are the tombs opened

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:46.000
up yeah yeah and they were full of

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:53.159
people who woke up and walked away walked away did you

01:23:53.159 --> 01:24:01.199
notice every time Jesus goes around a tomb there's somebody dead in it who gets up and walks away did you

01:24:01.199 --> 01:24:09.040
understand the process of the death and resurrection and the cult do you understand why they're doing that in the

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:16.400
cemeteries Jesus is not the only one on pasca who is under the influence of the

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:22.239
death inducer yeah they took him down from

01:24:22.239 --> 01:24:28.920
that cross and took him away any

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:35.000
phys could have patched him up any physician he could have been

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:43.840
given drugs to revive them and you say how do they oh don't worry you have orifices

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:51.760
baby yeah he could have been given drugs to revive him and what would he do then

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:57.280
he would walk away just like he said he would he'd go up to Galilee he'd meet him up

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:04.159
there when he was done do you know what Jesus was doing he was doing the mystery

01:25:04.159 --> 01:25:10.560
and the entire fairy tale that you have heard is false it's a figment of your

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:16.199
imagination the actual history is way better dude was caught up in a cult that

01:25:16.199 --> 01:25:22.719
was doing things you know and got him crossed with the Romans right oh next

01:25:22.719 --> 01:25:28.360
thing you know he's getting crucified just like like he thought he would give me the next one give me the next one oh

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:35.320
people love it people love it last I think that's it yeah they come out yep they get up next one boom and what

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:43.719
happens they come out of those tombs right this is the ageris yeah this is the

01:25:43.719 --> 01:25:51.520
aerus remember Jesus already said when Mary showed up with the sex drug dildo

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:58.719
dispenser Med medicinal dispenser um when he showed up with that he was

01:25:58.719 --> 01:26:05.679
already entering he told you this is the eni asmon right these rights they have

01:26:05.679 --> 01:26:14.119
processes that you go through steps in the initiations right prophets do these

01:26:14.119 --> 01:26:19.719
steps they perform these steps and now what is this step this is the step of

01:26:19.719 --> 01:26:28.239
the the Revelation right uh um the uh

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:35.280
ageris the ageris what is that aerus it's just from agor to wake up that's

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:41.639
what these mystery writs are all about and as soon as the person who is physically remember I showed you the

01:26:41.639 --> 01:26:48.719
drug and it said it looks like the person is completely dead that's what these people are doing in the tombs well

01:26:48.719 --> 01:26:53.760
guess what he's got a whole bunch of people around him that are doing the

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:59.320
rights don't you remember there are people who follow

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:07.199
Jesus and what are they doing they're entering the aerus it's a stage of the right that

erection your erection zombies and the erection of

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:17.400
Jesus Christ that would be the name of a band

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:25.480
thank you for coming tonight I think I'm going no don't leave thank you for coming to this part now we're going to

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:33.000
have Neil and I'm going to disappear into vapor um just for a little bit I'll be back and Neil is going to hit you

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:38.360
with some cult stuff Neil thanks for waiting so long tonight I appreciate I

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:45.679
appreciate the time um I want you to freely um just offer us whatever you

01:28:45.679 --> 01:28:51.000
want to offer us I'm going to shut up and give you that off opportunity yeah man I want to touch on

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.400
some of the things you were touching about about the Beloved disciple and what that means what that would have

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:01.800
meant for the Greek audience at the time period And I also want to promote some of my work that I got coming out in the

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:09.239
next week um a lot of things going on a lot of projects that I'm working on right now so with that being said I

01:29:09.239 --> 01:29:14.719
noticed you were rebuttal refuting some of these uh Christian online apologists

01:29:14.719 --> 01:29:22.679
who are uh afraid to look at their own their own text in in in in in a

01:29:22.679 --> 01:29:30.119
certain light they're afraid they're afraid of this stuff this is terrifying because what is a beloved disciple right

01:29:30.119 --> 01:29:35.679
what's going on for example what's going on in John's gospel where you got this

01:29:35.679 --> 01:29:43.840
clear depiction of this young the youngest of all of them and he's always depicted as this young boy hanging up on

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:49.080
Jesus's lap you know it's the Beloved disciple right you know there he is

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:56.000
again the youngest he's always got a cup in his hand he's always drinking underage drinking going on what's that

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:02.679
about you know sometime some of these Renaissance painters have some weird cultic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on with the Beloved

01:30:02.679 --> 01:30:09.400
disciple where he's holding a cup he's doing the seasian hand signals he's got snakes coming out of his Cups he's got

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:14.880
Venoms antivenoms Christ Antichrist so that's your beloved

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:21.639
disciple right you know standard stuff but what is a beloved disciple right what is a beloved disciple that's what I

01:30:21.639 --> 01:30:29.040
want to figure out so the first thing I want to do is we're going to go to well the one the

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:34.480
most famous beloved uh couple of all time was

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:39.880
Socrates and alabes by the way if you read diogenes

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:46.040
larus diynes lus tells us that Socrates when he was young when he was the age of

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:51.320
alabes he was the Beloved of archelus and then it's like then you

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:57.080
read the life of archelus archelus was the beloved of some other guy when he was younger and there's this like

01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:02.280
beloved lover relationship going on in the ancient Greek World being passed

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:07.719
down it's it's the way it was back then so you know I'm not saying I approve or

01:31:07.719 --> 01:31:14.960
anything but I'm just saying this is what the way this is the way things were as far as Christians being the ones to get rid of this stuff that is complete

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:21.400
nonsense because within the second and third and fourth Century the Romans the

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:27.119
Roman aristocracy the CIS R the middle platonist thinkers the neop Pythagorean

01:31:27.119 --> 01:31:32.520
thinkers they were the ones that were really pushing against pedasi whereas

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:39.480
the Christian authors you might find some of those some of those Augustines some of those other early Christian

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:45.360
authors you know acting like they're so disgusted about the uh perassi stuff but

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:50.840
it's like why do the church always the one that's getting in the news for doing

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:56.159
pasty so I don't know you guys figur that out on your own I'm just throwing that out there so I'm going to share

01:31:56.159 --> 01:32:03.000
this little screen real quick you got Socrates talking to his beloved and he

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:09.119
says to him I dare say you that you may be surprised to find oh son of clinus

01:32:09.119 --> 01:32:14.920
that I who am your first lover not have spoken for to you for many years when

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:22.560
the rest of the world were wearying you with their attentions and the last of your lovers who will speak to you see

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:30.560
this is this is this is beloved Socrates is beloved is Young alabes um you know he's one of the

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:37.040
students of Socrates he sitting around he's he's the young guy of the crew it's Plato it's

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:44.280
diogenes um cus is there tus is there there's a few other people there and uh

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:50.520
there's young alabes who's being trained to be the next general of the uh of the

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:56.679
a Athenian Army to fight the Persians to fight the Spartans and uh he's learning

01:32:56.679 --> 01:33:02.560
philosophy because that's what the Greeks do everybody learns philosophy especially if you got money now I want

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:07.760
to show something else real quick and we're gonna fly through this because I

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:15.080
got some stuff that I want to show but Socrates says to him he says the reason was that I loved you for your own sake

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:20.719
whereas other men love what belongs to you and your beauty which is not you is

01:33:20.719 --> 01:33:28.000
fading away just as your true self is beginning to Bloom and I will never desert you if you are not spoiled and

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.239
deformed by Athenian people for the danger which I most fear is that you

01:33:33.239 --> 01:33:39.840
will become a lover of the people and will be spoiled by them many a noble Athenian has been

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:45.480
ruined in this way for the Deus of the great-hearted erectus is of fair

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:50.920
countenance but you should see him naked wherefore observe the caution which I

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:56.600
give you which caution practice yourself sweet friend in learning what you ought

01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:03.920
to know before you enter on politics and then you will have an antidote which will keep you out of Harm's Way and so

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:10.280
they go They're you know they're having this little flirty conversation it's kind of known this is kind of known if you read the platonic dialogues that's

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:17.040
kind of what Socrates does he's kind of a flirty dude with all these other younger younger boys that's just hey man

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:22.920
I'm just calling it how I see it all right nothing you know that's just the way it was back then so another another

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:29.360
thing I want to show too is is um in diyes larus this is the most this this

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:38.280
shows up so common so often well you will you will find um you will find

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:44.040
these beloveds showing up in the text um for

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:51.000
example let's see where uh I think it's this one yes so

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:56.440
they're talking about the life of Lyon and it says he says here D L she is

01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:01.480
talking about the life of Leon and he was exceedingly beloved by humanus and

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:07.960
adelus who made him great presence and antigonus also tried to seduce him to

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:13.800
his court but was also disappointed and he was so great an enemy to heronemus

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:20.719
the paretic that he was the only person who would not go to see him on the anniversary Festival which he used to

01:35:20.719 --> 01:35:28.480
celebrate in which we mentioned in our life of Aros Solus and so as you can see the more you

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:34.320
read these ancient texts the more you read the lives of these ancient philosophers you'll see that term

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:39.440
beloved is very specific when it's thrown out there it means something very

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:46.159
specific it's the favored disciple and it's often a sexual relationship I'm not

01:35:46.159 --> 01:35:52.159
I'm not check fact check me on this when you see that word beloved in the Greek

01:35:52.159 --> 01:35:57.360
text it's often used for a sexual

01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:02.400
relationship for these for that's just the way it was so Jesus has got this boy

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:08.880
on his lap and he calls him his beloved disciple um just I'm just telling you the I'm

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:15.520
just giving you the evidence you decide what you want to do with that all right um but yeah so that's

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:22.840
that the other thing I wanted to discuss is the projects I got coming out so I got some clips that I want to

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:28.480
play have a video that's about 95% done now I was going to rush it out before I

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:35.920
went to I'm going to Florida tomorrow when I go to Florida I'm doing Matt Beal's podcast I'm doing another round

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:42.040
of Danny Jones so that's coming out soon um we're gonna talk about the founding

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:48.360
fathers we're gon to talk about democracy we're GNA talk about the Dark Ages we're gonna talk about the Statue

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:53.880
of Liberty we're going to talk about the anacreontic society The Star Spangled Banner we're going to talk about about

01:36:53.880 --> 01:37:00.040
the uh the the the roots of liberalism in the west is Christian is do we should

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:06.520
we credit judeo-christianity for Western values is that really a a thing or or

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:13.000
did what happened with Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Payne and and George Washington and all these great thinkers

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:19.719
and the French liberals you know the French Revolution that happened almost parallel to the American Revolution and

01:37:19.719 --> 01:37:25.159
even English liberalism On The Rise uh even Germany even Germany was was

01:37:25.159 --> 01:37:33.360
fighting against the status quo at the time which was the Holy Roman Empire which is the dead old bloated carcass

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:38.679
that everyone wanted to get rid of there was a a a a movement and what was that

01:37:38.679 --> 01:37:47.639
movement what was going on what was behind what was the core values of that movement and it's ancient Greek ideals

01:37:47.639 --> 01:37:54.800
ancient GRE Roman that's a good term to use because it's also Roman Roman Republic to be specific not Roman Empire

01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:02.719
Roman Republic which is based off Greek Democratic Athenian ideals so what do we

01:38:02.719 --> 01:38:07.840
get from those we get democracy we get constitutional republics we get the rule

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:14.840
of the people we get art we get tragedy we get dramas we get comedy we get

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:21.480
festivals every month we get the expression of the self we get philosophy

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:27.840
we get science we get FL fishing thinking

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:33.880
debate the we get we get civilization itself we get the images back paintings

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:41.000
sculptures all that stuff that we had people think this was like something that happened in the Renaissance that never that's never been seen before as

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:46.480
if Christianity was developing and and when it got to its high point in the Renaissance that gave the world all

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:51.639
these great things no read history what happened is those things

01:38:51.639 --> 01:38:57.320
were already a part of the world they were already a part of the world for hundreds and hundreds of years going

01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:02.400
back to the Iron Age going all the way to Antiquity those things were already

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:08.760
present you already had platonic acmis you already had great architecture with

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:15.440
Corinthian beautiful Corinthian columns you already had temples and you already had great musicians playing different

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:20.800
songs in frian mode and Di Dy Rambo mode and payen modes and you already had

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:27.840
festivals and you already had artistic expression and uh theaters happening and

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:35.760
people expressing themselves and and living life to the fullest in loving life and loving the world whereas all of

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:43.560
a sudden the world was something to be against and evil and the body is evil and expressing

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:51.400
yourself the way you desire is evil you should express yourself in the in the image of Christ and so you had this fake

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:58.320
Dark World that I called the Dark Ages so my Project's coming up is one of them talking to Danny Jones about this very

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:03.719
topic specifically about the founding fathers we're going to read a bunch of letters from the founding fathers like

01:40:03.719 --> 01:40:10.280
Thomas Jefferson Thomas Payne all that stuff we're getting into all that stuff and then I have a debate coming up so

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:15.920
that's the first project the second project is I have a debate coming up and that's kind of why I haven't been putting out content I'm trying to prep

01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:22.119
for this debate it was supposed to happen weeks ago but I got pushed back to the 22nd so I'll do that when I get back

01:40:22.119 --> 01:40:28.000
that's a debate with what if alt his what if alt is a right-wing he calls

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:35.280
himself right-wing I'm not I'm not describing him that way I'm not this is not like me like talking crap he calls himself right-wing he's a right-wing

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:41.599
political historian I'm using that in quotes because I don't know if I'd call him a historian he tries to do history

01:40:41.599 --> 01:40:47.320
that's for sure um and we're debating he's at 500,000 subscribers he's way

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:52.480
bigger than me he's got 500,000 we're going to debate about the Dark Ages is

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:59.840
the Dark Ages dark and I say yes they were this this idea that that's Politically Incorrect to say Dark Ages

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:05.400
we're going to offend Christians sorry but it was it was the Dark Ages so

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:13.000
that's the other project I got going on another project I got going on is Matt Beal's podcast that's three I'm also visiting Derek down there

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:19.760
we're gonna do some collaborations down there myth vision and then the fifth project which is going to come out

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:25.040
within a day or two when I get back and the reason I'm holding off on it is

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:32.679
because I have a few more edits that I have to do there's a few more changes that I have to make I want to make this video perfect and it's a it's a pmic

01:41:32.679 --> 01:41:38.639
video against Dan mclen it's right now it's about two and a half hours long

01:41:38.639 --> 01:41:46.280
that's how much content that's how much I have on refuting the stuff that Dan says I

01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:52.520
might trim down a lot of the fat and get it down to two hours so I have some edits I want to do I want to watch it a

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:59.040
couple times and after I watched it a couple times I want to decide what needs to get cut and

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:05.480
what should stay so I'm not rushing it out there it is pretty much done with that being said I want to give you guys

01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:12.320
a little bit of an appetite a little wet appetite on this so I want to play some of the clips um I'll pause it as we're

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:19.320
going and discuss some of it and uh I want to get ammon's thoughts too so without being without further Ado let's

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:26.000
pull up let me pull up the video here it

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:31.920
is 1.5 million unique words and the ancient Hebrew only has 8,000 unique

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:40.159
words and he was explaining to us he was showing us the differences and there was like for one word in Greek when you

01:42:40.159 --> 01:42:49.239
translate it to Hebrew there's like three or four words just to equal that one word in Greek so there's so a couple

01:42:49.239 --> 01:42:56.480
of things there one there's nowhere near that many Greek words there are ancient Greek you've got I think uh

01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:03.000
275,000 is the estimate more or less of of how many ancient Greek words there are if you look at all Greek ancient

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.400
medieval and modern you've got four to 500,000 and the what's that lexicon

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:14.360
website where we can actually look okay so what's about to happen here he just cited oh oh actually let me continue to

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:21.960
play I'll pause in a second get up thesaurus lingua graa yeah okay he just cited this website right here so I was

01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:28.280
like okay let's see what his website says this website that Dan himself cites

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:34.320
gives us 1.9 million words now if we if we had to be

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:40.599
charitable is he talking about the lamata let me see what he's talking about let's go back lexicon website

01:43:40.599 --> 01:43:47.000
where we can actually look it up ancient Greek you've got I think uh 275,000 is the estimate more or less of

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:53.920
of how many ancient Greek words there are if you look at all Greek ancient medieval and modern you've got four

01:43:53.920 --> 01:44:01.159
500,000 and what's that lexicon website where we can actually look it up show thesaurus lingu all right so if he was

01:44:01.159 --> 01:44:10.159
if the word if the number he was looking for was the lamata then then he's not correct because first

01:44:10.159 --> 01:44:17.560
of all he's off a little bit but even if that's what he was going for that's not what Almon said ammon's entire argument

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:23.920
was hinging on the expressiveness of Greek so if Alm is talking about the

01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:30.280
expressiveness of Greek you he's talking about unique word forms which means Dan

01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:35.639
is being either slick here or P or purposely dishonest by trying to cite

01:44:35.639 --> 01:44:40.800
the Lata which is not it's not well basically what happens is you have Lata

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:47.599
which is one word um lu Luen Lu Lu L

01:44:47.599 --> 01:44:55.080
that's all one L it's not three different words but Ammon saying the way you express luo can be expressed in 20

01:44:55.080 --> 01:45:01.199
different ways those are 20 different words that's what he was saying he's talking about unique word forms which

01:45:01.199 --> 01:45:06.480
means that Dan is being dishonest he's comparing app apples to oranges not

01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:14.119
Apples to Apples so his own source that he cited is a is is um is agreeing with

01:45:14.119 --> 01:45:20.239
Ammon real quick let me let me just um I'm going to share a different screen real quick and ammo do you have anything

01:45:20.239 --> 01:45:29.040
you want to say about that before I yeah talk about the 8000 cuz that was Muse The Muse came up

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:34.760
and gave it to him on this one I love oh we're gonna she brought it out of his

01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:42.239
mouth she brought it out of his mouth he was talking about himself it was pure bonic initiation I love it I'll be quiet

01:45:42.239 --> 01:45:50.920
go take me another thing another thing if you notice I'm gonna go back to that clip and you're gonna hear him say it he says modern ancient and classical all of

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:58.000
it that was the number he gave the we he cites doesn't do that the website that he cites is only modern now this the

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:04.159
reason why I had this lady on the screen right now is because she is a very famous scholar philanthropist

01:46:04.159 --> 01:46:10.520
philologist she's won a bunch of awards look she's got the gree's Order of the Phoenix award Italy's golden ascus award

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:16.800
San Diego's Women's Hall of Fame she's a straight up like like OG philologist

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:22.040
right uh you you see San Diego the reason why I'm showing her because she

01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:27.719
says this is going to be in the video too I'll show you this when I get there she says that there's five to six

01:46:27.719 --> 01:46:34.800
million total Greek unique word forms ancient modern classical all together so

01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:40.199
where did Dan get that number from I have no idea I tried to find it he's

01:46:40.199 --> 01:46:47.719
using the he's being kind of dishonest by citing the Lata and but not agre Ammon was talking

01:46:47.719 --> 01:46:53.760
about the word forms the entire time that's dishonest or he just doesn't know which I don't think does I think he has

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:59.040
to know this stuff he's supposedly a linguist all right so I'm going to go back to that clip we're going to

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:06.119
continue with what with what we're saying and you're going to hear this it gets even worse it gets a lot worse um

01:47:06.119 --> 01:47:11.840
let's see where did I put that video okay there it is here it

01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:18.159
is graa yeah okay okay TG can you find uh the tlg and and is there a way you

01:47:18.159 --> 01:47:23.400
can just search for Unique words in a certain language and it'll tell you uh you have to have an account notice how

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:29.440
even Danny said unique words unique words we're talking about a specific thing here okay now and I think to to do

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:35.199
the most robust kind of search with that oh but I think you should be able to do some pretty basic stuff okay see see

01:47:35.199 --> 01:47:41.639
what you can find Stephen um okay anyways you can keep going and then there are um there are

01:47:41.639 --> 01:47:49.560
79,900 like 45 words in Hebrew in the Hebrew Bible alone so 79,000 79,000 yeah

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:56.360
so I think he may have heard 80,000 somewhere yeah I think he may have misook 848

01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:02.080
because there the Hebrew Bible itself which is not all of ancient Hebrew like there's there was a lot of Hebrew

01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:09.800
writing and speaking outside the Hebrew Bible but now as you all know Dan was absolutely the opposite in this in this

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:15.760
on this uh who's correct here is it Dan or is it Ammon are they both half right no it's the opposite of what Dan just

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:22.800
said Ammon was 100% correct here uh Dan was 100% wrong here it was the exact opposite of what what Dan made the claim

01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:28.719
turned out that it was 8,000 um but listen but it that his mistake is worse

01:48:28.719 --> 01:48:34.880
than you think let me explain I'll play the video the Hebrew Bible itself has 880,000 different words in it he gave an

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:42.320
exact number 79,90 five words it's funny that the

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:49.239
next day after this interview went down Dan mlen posted the following post on X

01:48:49.239 --> 01:48:55.280
he said yesterday I recorded a podcast interview which I now you're going to notice that in this clip that I have right here I I'm speeding through it

01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:02.560
because I don't want to read the whole thing but you understand he makes the claim that he meant to say 880,000 he

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:09.800
this is what he says in this he meant to say something was telling me I was 880,000 but for some reason it came out

01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:15.119
the wrong way I said 8,000 that's not what he said he gave he

01:49:15.119 --> 01:49:22.239
didn't say there was no decimal move he gave an exact number okay that's just

01:49:22.239 --> 01:49:29.639
listen responded to the claims related to ancient Greek and Hebrew made by DR Ammon Hilman on a previous episode ancient Greek lexic Greek from Antiquity

01:49:29.639 --> 01:49:36.280
to today in the previous interview though Dr hel actually in a later live stream claim did not come from the

01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:44.159
previous podcast interview it's on the claim that the ancient Hebrew had 8,000 words that I made an embarrassing

01:49:44.159 --> 01:49:51.360
mistake somehow I got it in my head that the Hebrew Bible had 880,000 distinct

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:56.599
words in it but that's widely inaccurate he never says

01:49:56.599 --> 01:50:03.400
80,000 he gives an exact amount by the way he knew this I'll talk

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:11.480
about this in the video this won't be in this clip but I'm gonna tell you right now he knew this question was coming for weeks why he didn't prepare or check I

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:17.199
don't know but the thing that's worse to me is not that he made a mistake I don't care about people making mistakes and

01:50:17.199 --> 01:50:24.599
then correcting themselves that's a plaus that's pla you I applaud that kind of behavior hey I was wrong d uh almma

01:50:24.599 --> 01:50:30.880
was right so why am I even pushing this putting this in his face I'm not putting this in his face that he's wrong I'm

01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:37.840
actually discrediting him as being dishonest here because he gave an exact number and then tried to make it seem

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:45.760
like it was a it was a decimal error and I knew the right thing but I just for some reason it came out wrong he he I'm

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:51.239
calling him a liar let's let's let's be blunt here I think he's lying about this

01:50:51.239 --> 01:50:57.320
why do I think he's lying because CU he did this to me before when we had it when we had a back and forth on X one

01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:03.079
time and he called and I called him out for being for not understanding middle platonism and not understanding like

01:51:03.079 --> 01:51:10.520
monism or platonism at all and not understanding like the Creator gods and demiurges of the time period of Paul

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:16.760
were what that was the popular thing of the time period to have one God who's in control of the cosmos whether there's

01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:23.040
creation ex niilo does not matter there was one God who was in who was in control who was the mind of the universe

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:28.599
that noose that's an idea that goes back to Plato that's an idea that's that's developed by the stoics and the middle

01:51:28.599 --> 01:51:35.840
platonist by the time Paul comes around that's status quo he tried to tell me that I don't know my sources he will get

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:42.599
he threw five books in my face and this is what he does here he'll he'll site sources like he knows what he's doing

01:51:42.599 --> 01:51:48.560
then I checked those sources and it turned out that they agreed with what I was saying that he's the one who didn't actually know the sources and then so

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:53.639
what does he do did he actually come along and say hey you know what Neil you're were right I'm going to change my

01:51:53.639 --> 01:52:00.360
ideas now I'm going to go you know this is this was a good back and forth exchange you're correct I'm wrong sorry

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:06.480
nope he pretends doesn't even happen he just acts like it never even happened so this is why when this came along when I

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:14.239
noticed this happened and he tried to make it seem like it was he said 880,000 or he said 8,000 but meant 880,000

01:52:14.239 --> 01:52:19.960
no you said 79,000 you gave an exact number to the

01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:25.119
decimal that's a lie you you cannot get out of this anyways let's

01:52:25.119 --> 01:52:33.118
continue that's full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my man you did not say 80,000 you said

01:52:34.119 --> 01:52:41.800
79,90 and then there are um there are 79,900 like 45 words in Hebrew in the

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:48.360
Hebrew Bible alone so 79,000 think about this for a second use your let's let's think about this use

01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:55.678
your head for a second simple IQ here he gave a number of

01:52:56.079 --> 01:53:04.639
79,90 which means he purposely gave five decimals with 799 with 79 he didn't say

01:53:04.639 --> 01:53:12.360
there's 880,000 and then go oh whoa I meant 8,000 I was off by a decimal which is what he claims in his expost that's

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:17.880
not what happened that is pure dishonesty on his part 100% if you can't

01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:23.199
see that I don't know what to tell you 9,000 yeah so I think he may have heard 80,000 some

01:53:23.199 --> 01:53:31.280
he said eight yeah I think he may have mistook 80 for actually you're the one that mistook 8 for

01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:40.840
80 an exact number go ahead he's looking into the mirror right saying he mistook

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:47.560
he mistook no I knew what it was you're the one who's undergoing the initiation

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:55.159
oh I love it it's gorgeous P Watch How I zoom into his face when he says that ,000 79,000 yeah so I think he may have

01:53:55.159 --> 01:54:00.960
heard 80,000 somewhere he said eight yeah I think he may have mistook 848

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:06.520
because they're look at that smug look you're the one that mistook it and and it's not even I'm not even giving the

01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:14.719
benefit of the doubt of mistaking it now because you could have just came on X and said you know what I'm wrong I

01:54:14.719 --> 01:54:20.840
didn't I didn't even realize how how much more ammon's correct here the Greek is a lot more expressive there's a lot

01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:27.880
more words there's a lot more forms and uh Hebrew actually has a lot less words than I thought I thought it was 80,000 I

01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:35.040
thought it was 79,000 turned out to be 8,000 but instead he he had to pretend that he still has control that he still

01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:41.639
knows what he's doing he had to create an illusion that I was correct and I knew it the whole time but I just made a

01:54:41.639 --> 01:54:48.040
little error that to me is dishonesty that's worse than being wrong being being wrong is not a big deal I don't

01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:53.119
care I I'm wrong about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all the time it's about oh hey [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was proven

01:54:53.119 --> 01:54:59.400
wrong cool I learned something today but no you couldn't even you couldn't even humble yourself you're that proud in

01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:06.520
your PhD that you couldn't be wrong you had to be correct still you couldn't just admit that you were wrong anyways

01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:11.719
that that pissed me off that's why I'm showing this today there's more though and this is going to be a two and a half

01:55:11.719 --> 01:55:17.760
hour video I'm G to trim it down right now I'm at two and a half hours this is the whole video is like this you gave an

01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:23.800
exact number this is not getting a decimal wrong this is is claiming

01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:28.960
something finding out that you're wrong and then trying to backpedal and say no

01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:35.639
I knew it the whole time 45 words in Hebrew in the Hebrew Bible alone but you

01:55:35.639 --> 01:55:42.000
made a claim and your honesty is on the line now this is dis you see Greek in

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.360
the synagogues no theoa is what this guy

01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:53.599
job has and I want you to see that this is that sabba internal concept cep of

01:55:53.599 --> 01:55:59.920
Theo or Sab the synagogue inscriptions where somebody and and god-fearer was a

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:07.000
title that was used in the helenistic Jewish World to refer to somebody who was a Greek or a Roman was not Jewish

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:14.159
but supported the Jewish community so it was like he's a friend of the Jews he's a god-fearer that's not the only time

01:56:14.159 --> 01:56:19.280
that word is used that word is used way before the septu agent or Hebrew Bible

01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:24.960
even existed for pretty much anyone who religious in any way they could that was

01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:32.119
used in the helenistic Jewish World to refer to somebody who was a Greek or Roman was not Jewish but supported the

01:56:32.119 --> 01:56:39.560
Jewish community and maybe some new testament who has never came AC that and that and it only means that and sorry

01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:44.840
about that I was trying to skip ahead that it's not important you'll see these parts when I when I drop the video by

01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:50.960
the way this is blurry because I did a screen recording just so I can have it easily for this video certain context

01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:57.880
even here I would admit that's what it means but I'm just want people to realize he's making a claim a broad

01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:05.599
Claim about a definition of a word with a very narrow scope on where the word comes from here's Herodotus in the mid

01:57:05.599 --> 01:57:11.280
fth century BCE using that exact word a

01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:17.000
[Music] kaios

01:57:17.719 --> 01:57:23.280
deakin epin or perhaps he heard that risus was

01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:30.880
Pious and put him at top of the fire to find out if this um and so you have like uh ferary inscriptions uh where on

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:36.960
somebody's headstone that says this is Dave godfear so that was that just meant he was a friend of the Jewish

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:43.000
people now the big thing that I'm going to drill home here and which I do and I have some more edits that I have to do

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:48.159
here he he's talking about the passage Alan made a claim that this word has a

01:57:48.159 --> 01:57:53.280
meaning in Greek and it has an atmology this word Theos and

01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:58.440
sabase Dan tried to say that Almon was wrong about this atmology and he wasn't

01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:05.880
Ammon is actually correct that this word when you look up the history of the word it's it usually just means Pious

01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:13.960
devotion religious that word sabba is where you get the word Augustus from in Latin the Greek version of sa of of uh

01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:20.040
Augustus is sasto so the AUST the August one the revered one that's what this

01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:26.599
word means now watch what Dan tries to say say about this word he only looks at it through his judeo-christian scope

01:58:26.599 --> 01:58:33.280
because he only knows the Hebrew Bible and nothing else he has no training in Classics at all you can just tell watch

01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:39.719
the base actually no if you found if you find a random Tombstone of a guy named Dave who was let me just repeat Let me

01:58:39.719 --> 01:58:45.119
just repeat what he says right here this is important to find out if this um and so

01:58:45.119 --> 01:58:52.639
you have like uh funerary inscriptions uh where on somebody's headstone it says this is Dave godfear so that that just

01:58:52.639 --> 01:58:59.480
meant he was a friend of the Jewish people actually no if you found if you find a random Tombstone of a guy named

01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:05.400
Dave who was a god-fearer you can't just conclude that he's a friend of the Jews he could have been a god-fearer of

01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:12.280
another God You' have to find out is this in a Jewish cemetery is this a Christian Cemetery you have to find out

01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:18.000
the cont this synagogue was built thanks to the help of so and so thees godfear

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:24.760
so that's with Jews or Christians by the way I found an example of a synagogue in

01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:32.000
Greece built by god-fearers who worshiped Theos or uh uh Theos

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.280
hipos God most high for a long time they thought it was this Jewish synagog

01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:44.040
helenistic Jewish synagogue it turns out that recently Scholars and archaeologists have said we don't we

01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:50.400
this might not even be Jewish that it it might just be a hipy serian Greek monist

01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:56.719
synagogue because there are syn OG in the Greek world that doesn't necessarily have to be Jewish and so the idea that

01:59:56.719 --> 02:00:02.880
you would find a tombstone in somewhere laying anywhere Greece whatever and this the tombstone of of godfear worshiping

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:08.679
God most high it does not necessarily mean he's a friend of the Jews I have I have examples of that that I'm going to

02:00:08.679 --> 02:00:16.400
show in the video AOC edus

02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:22.719
FAS there's that word Theos in the female genitive form and it means means

02:00:22.719 --> 02:00:30.239
if they say that Athens is most devout towards the gods once again Devotion to

02:00:30.239 --> 02:00:35.400
the gods having nothing to do with Jews or Christians or friendly to the Jews

02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:40.480
once again in Plato's credis he uses the same word

02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:46.599
aathu aus Genai through the mouth of Socrates which is a person who is good

02:00:46.599 --> 02:00:53.920
and Pious becomes impious false the sacred Jew

02:00:54.639 --> 02:01:03.040
here's another example from aristophanes's Birds the usan epan it is imperative

02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:11.400
that I sing another sacred chant for the by the way there's that word usan again too so there's a it's dionan to the core

02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:19.920
this word has dionan roots it's about it's about Devotion to the gods and being inspired by theia it's sabba it's

02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:27.320
Sab baby and it is bakas you don't understand this is got It's Got bakic

02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:32.360
Roots to it you're ABS Main Line bakic This

02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:37.880
is this is what my mind about this video because he's so in a different world

02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:43.800
than you that what what you're saying went right over his head as if I've never heard that before so it must be

02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:49.199
wrong they just assume you're wrong because they never heard that before because in Bible scholarship land they

02:01:49.199 --> 02:01:55.679
don't look at Theo Sease in its original content text that you find in Plato Aristophanes uh what else did I cite

02:01:55.679 --> 02:02:03.560
here um uh uh uh yeah Sophocles Aristophanes Plato Herodotus I I keep

02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:10.159
going too I give a whole bunch of examples and it's it's the wor it's the frenzy di worship of a god it's being

02:02:10.159 --> 02:02:16.159
inspired by God through this Mania that's the context that it's used in that word usan right next to it the holy

02:02:16.159 --> 02:02:21.400
ones the the sabba Sab zos that's what the word comes from yeah you get sbes

02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:29.599
you get from there it's all there so let's continue can I just ask before you continue which is lovely I love this um

02:02:29.599 --> 02:02:37.159
did you doubt me along the way when I was saying this it may have sounded crazy I did at first absolutely right

02:02:37.159 --> 02:02:42.920
back when we did this live stream I had no idea what you were talking about I just didn't know I just had no clue and

02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:48.040
then I it's it's not you're not wrong the word does mean the word in its

02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:53.840
context in these ancient Greek sources does mean what you're saying it means means it's just that they're seeing it

02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:58.920
in this judeo-christian context where in the book of Acts admittedly and I say

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:05.360
this in the video in the book of Acts they use that word godfear for the ones that are for the for the Gentiles that

02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:11.599
are worshiping that are godfear that are worshiping that are worshiping Jewish god so that does happen it does become

02:03:11.599 --> 02:03:19.040
that word it can be defined that way but it's not originally did not originally mean that right that's the that's that's

02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:24.159
what you were saying too so I'm just you know that's why that's why I made this video I'm trying to show people this

02:03:24.159 --> 02:03:29.760
anyways let's continue light of the lustral water that I invoke the sacred

02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:38.239
chant the word sacred is used as thease so you don't need God-fearing you

02:03:38.239 --> 02:03:46.520
don't need Yahweh you don't need Judaism cedia the word right here is

02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:52.119
oos PES me

02:03:52.119 --> 02:03:57.840
but all reverently there's the word reverence responded with a loud voice

02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:06.199
the notion that this Hebrew didn't pre-exist that title that this is a translation from uh that title is is

02:04:06.199 --> 02:04:12.239
nonsensical damn he just tried to make it seem like that this word does not predate the

02:04:12.239 --> 02:04:17.480
Hebrew that's wrong as I just showed that's objectively wrong that's not even

02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:26.239
like what you just said is not even a matter of opinion it's just wrong what you just just said so okay though and so

02:04:26.239 --> 02:04:33.440
so it's it's that's one word in Greek right right and then so if I say it's a compound word though because it's Theos

02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:39.040
and uh and the verb for fear so two of them being put together in one word because it's

02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:45.920
Theos and and the verb for fear saase is an adjective like

02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:52.960
aase doesn't even so this right here made me realize he's not familiar with this word he's not reading Greek sources

02:04:52.960 --> 02:05:00.599
this is as I just demonstrated I just gave you five different sources where this word is used If he if he even ran

02:05:00.599 --> 02:05:07.960
into this one time he would never he would not have said that's a verb for fear it's not a verb for fear it's being

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:14.119
translated as godfear because that's what we call it today but that if you wanted to break it down etymologically

02:05:14.119 --> 02:05:20.040
it's not a verb for fear but I break it down right here he what he just said demonstrates that he's has zero

02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:26.719
knowledge of the classics because this is a ve as Aman pointed out a year ago this is a very important technical

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:32.440
religious term Theo saase it's everywhere in the ancient classic sources I just gave you a whole plethora

02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:38.280
of of of of uh examples this is a very common and very important word with for

02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:45.920
studying ancient religion for to not know this is like calling yourself an expert in Marvel Comics and not knowing

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:50.960
like not knowing like who Jane who uh Peter Parker dates Jane whatever her

02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:59.000
name is like it's like basic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that everyone knows and you're just like huh oh it's the verb for fear I think God

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:04.520
fearing oh it must be the verb for fear then duh no you didn't check and you

02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:11.159
don't know the sources sorry but you're wrong and this is objectively wrong anyways I explain it right here impas

02:06:11.159 --> 02:06:18.599
and Phobos is a noun which is fear so fos saase can become God-fearing by

02:06:18.599 --> 02:06:24.800
definition but it doesn't break down in the way he just said God and seas Theos

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:31.280
being God and Sease being the verb for fear that's like saying Augustus which

02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:39.000
in Latin which in Greek means sebastes that's like saying Augustus is the feared one or the fearful one it's not

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:46.480
what it means like that's not the verb for fear it's not even a verb anyway it's an adjective that is not correct

02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:55.239
you would not pass an exam if you wrote that down for the definition that is not correct sebum menos is a worshipper and

02:06:55.239 --> 02:07:02.800
a fobu menos is a fearer those are middle passive participles fobi is to be

02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:07.840
scared and Afraid Mi because it means life or death for a lot of people around

02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:13.719
the world and when you're holding up the two here's okay this is the last part that I'm going to show you because the

02:07:13.719 --> 02:07:19.840
rest of the video is about this topic right here two pillars of Christianity

02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:25.199
is special and unique and has no influence from any Greek mythology or

02:07:25.199 --> 02:07:31.480
philosophical Pagan stuff and uh the Old Testament is this ancient Bronze Age text that goes back all the way to

02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:37.119
samarians when you tell people that stuff you make them think that this book is

02:07:37.119 --> 02:07:42.280
magic so the rest the the the the majority of the two two and a half hour

02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:48.559
video is about the the idea like I'm talk so first of all I've this I've actually the

02:07:48.559 --> 02:07:54.920
reason why it's has taken so long because I had the interview with um Jonathan Adler so I'm going to feature him in the video a little bit on some

02:07:54.920 --> 02:08:01.199
parts about the dating the Old Testament dating the Torah when is the Torah being oberved all that stuff we touch on that

02:08:01.199 --> 02:08:08.840
we also I also had a discussion with a an anthropologist who is a current professor over in Italy about dying and

02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:16.199
Rising gods and James Frasier everything that Dan mclen says about dying and Rising gods and James Fraser she says

02:08:16.199 --> 02:08:23.679
the exact opposite so what we got one who's a current current Professor who wrote her dissertation on James Frasier

02:08:23.679 --> 02:08:29.480
and dying and Rising Gods current Professor anthropology classic studies

02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:35.239
so she's it's her field she's dominating she's the authority not him and then on the other side you have a guy who

02:08:35.239 --> 02:08:41.840
doesn't know Classics who's not a current Professor who only studies judeo-christianity and he's a Christian

02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:49.079
and he's got a he's got a dog to fight in this thing um so just saying he's got he's got some I don't I don't I never

02:08:49.079 --> 02:08:54.400
let my bias get in the way oh that's odd that you're not a trinity you don't believe in the Trinity and uh Mormons

02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:59.599
are are unitarians and um what else uh you think Moses was around in the 700s

02:08:59.599 --> 02:09:04.840
BC because you got the book of nii and Lehi and theyve write about Moses just

02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:10.639
happens to be certain things that line up with there just putting it out there all I'm saying is this one one expert

02:09:10.639 --> 02:09:15.760
who studies dying and Rising Gods who's written dissertations on an Nana dying

02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:22.440
for three days and resurrecting which was celebrated at the Spring Equinox during the akitu festival uh then you

02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:28.040
have ball who she says when ball Rises the word they use a verb to stand in

02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:33.159
Greek the resurrection is the verb to stand it's the same thing it's just a

02:09:33.159 --> 02:09:41.159
different language but using the same verb to stand she points that out very very very slickly um and then dianis who

02:09:41.159 --> 02:09:47.639
she says is the most ex obvious example most obvious example of a God who dies

02:09:47.639 --> 02:09:55.159
and resurrects and not only does he die and resurrect that his his worship his his devotion like the the thing that

02:09:55.159 --> 02:10:02.679
makes dionis special is the fact that he is a he's a he's the god of Resurrection

02:10:02.679 --> 02:10:07.719
like that's what he's like main he's the it for example at delie you have the

02:10:07.719 --> 02:10:14.599
dely it's the Temple of Apollo where the muses are but on the bottom of the mountain you have a have a tomb and the

02:10:14.599 --> 02:10:20.639
tomb is for Dian Isis Dian Isis is dead because dianis is the resurrection

02:10:20.639 --> 02:10:27.520
that's what he was was known for for Jesus to come along and be a a god of Resurrection you are directly in

02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:33.400
competition with the cult of dianis 100 per. and so the the whole chunk of this

02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:40.960
video is sh D when Dan when Dan gets when when they talk about hararia the look on Dan's face it's like he's never

02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:46.280
heard of it this is the first time he's ever heard of the Hilaria how do you not know about the hararia and you call

02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:51.320
yourself a scholar of religion every main textbook about Roman religion

02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:56.639
whether it be Mary beard whether it be um what else do I got here

02:10:56.639 --> 02:11:02.639
uh a ancient Greek uh religion uh let's

02:11:02.639 --> 02:11:09.079
see um all the source books all the good source books here we go Greek religion

02:11:09.079 --> 02:11:14.920
that's in here uh the ancient Mysteries ancient Mysteries um what else

02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:20.960
do I got I wish I had more I wish I was more prepared to show anyways here's a

02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:26.760
big one Mary Beard's Roman religion um basically any Source book

02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:32.960
that you can think of that's not it any Roman religion

02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:40.320
Source book that you could think of is going to have at least a chapter if not multiple chapters on the Hilaria and how

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:48.119
how important it was during the march Equinox for the Romans and it's initiated in the in the early 1 Century

02:11:48.119 --> 02:11:55.320
during the reign of Claudius so after the reign of Claudius you have a resurrection Festival in Rome

02:11:55.320 --> 02:12:00.599
during the same week that Jesus resurrects now notice how I didn't make

02:12:00.599 --> 02:12:06.000
any arguments I didn't say one's copying the other all I'm doing is giving you a

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:11.840
fact there's a fact hararia was celebrated by the Romans during the week

02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:17.840
of the Spring Equinox March 22nd to 25th that's a fact notice how I don't even

02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:24.639
say and all I have to do is say that and you start getting through you start getting push back no that's pyge no

02:12:24.639 --> 02:12:29.960
that's mythicism I didn't even say anything I didn't even say Christians copied it but that's their knee-jerk

02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:35.800
reaction because they it's like they have to defend it for some reason there's a there's an emotional response

02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:41.639
to this topic and the reason why you know he has this emotional response to this topic is how often he talks about

02:12:41.639 --> 02:12:47.920
this subject once a week at least he's doing a new video about Zeitgeist about

02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:54.559
some random Ralph Ellis or whoever I don't even know these people half the time he he he he's he's rebutting videos

02:12:54.559 --> 02:12:59.960
from like 10 years ago about people who compare Krishna and Jesus that nobody

02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:08.559
even pays attention to so it's like the main thing that he studies and and and uh is focused on is this random topic

02:13:08.559 --> 02:13:14.840
that I think is like totally meaningless any thoughts on that I have one more thing that I want to show any

02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:21.800
thoughts on that ah I'm getting so full of yummy yummy

02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:29.800
Dan oh this is the best barbecue of any human soul I've ever had

02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:37.679
because um look at how in your face with the reasoning you I love that

02:13:37.679 --> 02:13:46.800
79,900 what was it 45 um yeah breaking breaking off that

02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:54.400
BS uh uh is you can't do anything that's Hercule man beautiful job beautiful job

02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:59.520
let let's finish you the clips all right so the last thing that I

02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:05.639
wanted to show you was I think I have it here pretty

02:14:05.639 --> 02:14:11.760
sure I have here it is okay so I'm gonna this is the last thing all right let me

02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:17.679
just pull this image up and I'll tell you when I'm going to share my screen okay and this is going to be in the

02:14:17.679 --> 02:14:24.960
video too I just didn't bring the clip but it's G it's in the video he posted this recently and we were all

02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:32.239
talking about how this happened okay we all enjoyed this it was a great great I thought it was awesome shout outs to the

02:14:32.239 --> 02:14:38.840
Olympics because they did a great job with this uh opening ceremony that's very Dian it's very Greek it's very

02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:44.360
Olympic they did a great job I give him an A+ I enjoyed it and it had nothing to

02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:51.079
do with the it had nothing to do with Jesus in The Last Supper because the last supper was using the same imagery

02:14:51.079 --> 02:14:58.000
that the Renaissance painters used for the the Symposium of Dian Isis and Apollo so anyways it's easy it's funny

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:04.040
how Christians will will mix this up so somebody made this post now I'm just gonna say off the bat that I don't agree

02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:09.079
with all this I think this push this person's pushing them pushing the limit especially when they use the word

02:15:09.079 --> 02:15:15.320
plagiarize don't use that word plagiarize is a specific thing when you actually take words and copy and paste

02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:23.040
them inspired by just use the word inspired by or competing with or ping

02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:29.400
sometimes they flip things sometimes things are the opposite but that's still inspired by right so you don't use the

02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:35.159
word plagiarize trying whoever made this I'm trying to help you out all right he says diis had Divine father and mother

02:15:35.159 --> 02:15:40.719
was sacrificed died and resurrected that's true that's true so

02:15:40.719 --> 02:15:46.800
far we're good lne symbolizes his blood that's also true and I show the sources for this by the way everything in here

02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:53.440
everything in here I'm going to show every primary source for it all of ite dating Christianity was a traveling

02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:59.040
teacher who performed Miracles so is everyone else I don't I don't think anyone really cares about that part

02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:06.159
turned water into wine at a wedding that is also true that's from a third Century BC Source it's also from py the younger

02:16:06.159 --> 02:16:13.559
it's also in panus which is contemporary with the gospels so he doesn't know the gospels so anyways anyways we have we

02:16:13.559 --> 02:16:20.719
have sources for that was associated with a purple cloak that's true he wore a Pur he wears a purple cloak in the in

02:16:20.719 --> 02:16:27.480
the um in the homeric C to dionis the first thing it says is dianis appeared at the shore beautiful was his hair

02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:32.840
locks uh he's wearing an ivy diadem and a purple cloak so the person says he has

02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:40.719
a crown of thorns that's not true because the crown of thorns represents death Dian Isis represents life Jesus is

02:16:40.719 --> 02:16:46.439
the god of death he wears the crown of thorns he's going to his grave he's going to the Cross Dion Isis wears a

02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:53.598
crown of Ivy that's full of swelling fruits and Beres and a pine cone so that

02:16:53.599 --> 02:16:59.920
there you have a pic going on there Dian Isis so there might be something going on with them putting on a crown of

02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:05.840
thorns on Jesus's head as his own image because Apollo wears a crown Aphrodite

02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:12.638
wears a crown D all the Sons and Daughters of gods have their own IM specific Crown so Jesus wearing a crown

02:17:12.639 --> 02:17:19.478
of thorns could be his own specific thing that they're doing because he's a guy that's about to die that's I that's

02:17:19.479 --> 02:17:26.598
as far as I would go I would never say that Dian Isis and Jesus had the same Crown don't do that was said to be twice

02:17:26.599 --> 02:17:33.518
born or born again that's true was a born of a virgin on December 25th and was called the holy child this is

02:17:33.519 --> 02:17:40.040
actually kind of true but the sources for this are after the gospels but I do

02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:49.040
talk about how it's not as black and there's there's some nuances here this is mentioned in uh macrobius saturnalia

02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:55.760
that that bakus and Apollo are born born on the winter solstice and uh epiphanius does say that

02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:01.678
ion or duus were born of the Corey that's pany

02:18:01.679 --> 02:18:07.678
at December 25th called the holy child so there is some sort of nuance going on there but he the way he argued is

02:18:07.679 --> 02:18:12.880
incorrect god of the vine Jesus Is God of the vine that's also true had 12

02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:18.880
disciples that why why who cares about 12 discip he doesn't he has saturs and

02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:26.800
mads but it doesn't say 12 okay now did he ride Triumph On A procession of donkey yes he does in the

02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:34.160
story of um the frogs by Aristophanes he rides into de Athens on a donkey and

02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:39.558
then he goes down into Hades performs the katabasis raises Asus from the dead

02:18:39.559 --> 02:18:46.800
and comes back from Hades triumphantly and does the anabasis so he it's a dying it's a it's a descent and return story

02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:55.280
and you have a donkey riding into the city scene and there's dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens

02:18:55.281 --> 02:19:01.439
of pottery showing the scene of dianis riding on a donkey this Pottery would

02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:08.000
have been in circulation in Judea during the time of Zechariah Zechariah might have saw this

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:13.638
and used this I'm just saying I'm not saying that's we could prove that but I think it's plausible now what does Dan

02:19:13.639 --> 02:19:19.558
say about this Dan the expert right he's the expert on this stuff he's going to be

02:19:19.559 --> 02:19:26.160
the judge right he's going to be the he he says I'm the referee here I'm going to be calling balls and Strikes he says

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:33.558
as far as I know now I'm glad he starts to say this now because he used to not say this he used to say there is no

02:19:33.559 --> 02:19:40.040
sources as if he read every single text in the world and knew this but I've been calling him out on this lately and I

02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:45.280
think I'm part of the reason why he says as far as I know because now he can say

02:19:45.281 --> 02:19:52.200
well it's only I only said as far as I know but let's see what he says I'm glad by the way that's what you're supposed to say as far as I know is what you're

02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:58.319
supposed to say because nobody knows everything you can always be proven wrong right he says the only things on

02:19:58.319 --> 02:20:05.240
this list that are true are that dionis had a Divine father and Mortal mother that has performed Miracles and that he

02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:14.040
was the god of Vine god of the vine what are you kidding me so he Dam mlen

02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:20.840
doesn't even know that Dian Isis has a resurrection story are you that's mindblowing and he

02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:27.720
going around talking about dying and Rising gods don't exist not even knowing that Dian Isis is the prime example of a

02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:32.800
God who dies and resurrects has no idea just never never read that text he's got

02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:39.080
it took him 15 years to get his PhD as he says never F never once came across the attack of Dian Isis and and being

02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:46.640
torn apart by the by the Titans and then coming back triumphantly by the way can I just say

02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:55.760
anybody who knows anything about the Cult of the mystery knows that dionis

02:20:55.760 --> 02:21:02.880
provides for us that prototypic journey into Hades and

02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:08.560
retrieval again and funny thing was in the ceremony that they talk about with

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:16.680
dianis it's always related that over the grave of the person who showed him the

02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:25.080
entryway to hell he plants a dildo and he uses the dildo on

02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:31.359
himself yeah it's um when people talk about Osiris don't be surprised you know

02:21:31.359 --> 02:21:39.200
what I mean but this is the mystal so the fact that Dan can't recognize this is just it's for the reason that that

02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:44.880
you know he hasn't stepped outside his own theologians he's not you know it's

02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:51.880
like you said he's not well-versed I mean yummy this is yummy isn't it but he's not well versed man so let's so

02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:57.680
let's go over what he doesn't know and what what we can prove right now that Dan mlen doesn't know about right so

02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:03.880
let's let me pull up this uh let me pull up that list again um uh okay I'm gonna

02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:09.160
get to this in a second but first let me go back to this list so he says the only thing that's true here is that he's a

02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:16.600
Divine father and Mortal mother and that he performed Miracles and that he's a god of the vine Divine father mortal

02:22:16.600 --> 02:22:23.080
mother so he doesn't even say anything about his wine being his the blood of bakus being symbolized by wine in the

02:22:23.080 --> 02:22:28.240
linian Mysteries that's all over the sources even even Clement of Alexandria

02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:35.160
right uh specifically talks about that it doesn't he doesn't know about him being sacrificed as The Bull dying and

02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:40.920
resurrected he's the bow that's and there's there's actually texts about being washed in the blood of the bow and

02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:48.800
the bull is marked as sabazius is that word sabba again it all comes full circle right that's so I show that too

02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:57.000
he doesn't know that um he had a triumphant procession he doesn't know that he wore purple which is very so he

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:05.040
doesn't so he doesn't even know the basics the basics for to know dianis you have to at least know the um the hym to

02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:10.280
dianis or the homeric him to dianis where it introduces him wearing an ivy

02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:18.000
crown and having a purple cloak that's what it does but here's the big one that I want to point out he he mentions oh if

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:24.000
anyone could find anything else make sure you find the story and it has to predate the it has to predate the whole

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:30.399
story of Jesus's mystery uh Ministry what all right this is from so these are

02:23:30.399 --> 02:23:36.960
these orphic tablets that are floating around all over the Mediterranean they date between some the or the oldest ones

02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:42.760
go back to like 500 600 BC maybe 500 BC and then they start and then all the way

02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:50.520
up to the 400s BC they're everywhere they look like this they're golden tablets and they're Greek they find

02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:56.240
these these even exist in Israel you they even found these in Israel that's how far that's they're all over the

02:23:56.240 --> 02:24:03.399
Mediterranean and they they're called orphic tablets they usually have they're usually buried with the dead and it's

02:24:03.399 --> 02:24:10.640
messages into Hades on how to get through Hades and how to get reincarnated the right way one of them

02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:15.840
so one of them reads this this is a translation from rewig 1998 and it says

02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:21.560
on the one side it says uh but in front of you will the cold water flowing forth

02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:27.920
from the lake of memory Guardians pass above they will surely ask you with their crowded thought thoughts for what

02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:35.840
reason do you seek darkness of dank Hades and you say I am the child of Earth and star arinos Gaia and uranos

02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:41.080
and when you say that it tells them that you're part of the musty the mystery

02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:46.560
you're part you're an initiate and you're a bakco okay so to in order to be

02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:51.880
resurrected in order to take part in the resurrection you have to drink the co

02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:59.160
the Kon it says it right there they will give you the drink of Lake of memory when you drink you will travel a road the sacred road which other famous

02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:05.000
initiates musty say root of the word mystery mystery of Christ all that and

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:11.000
you're a bakco so to take part in in in eternal life you have to know this check

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:16.640
this out the other side says this it's dedicated to dianis the

02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:23.920
releaser and it's cut in the shape of ivy leaves dionis lucios and it says now

02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:29.960
you died and now you were born Thrice blessed one on this day that's about

02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:37.000
dionisis he's the Thrice blessed one tell feris phona the bakik one himself

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:42.359
has released you a bowl there's the sacrifice so right here we just knocked

02:25:42.359 --> 02:25:48.560
off two of Dan's that he didn't know that he's a sacrifice and that he resurrects he has a resurrection the bo

02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:53.920
as a bow you leaped into milk that's the image of the sacrifice suddenly you

02:25:53.920 --> 02:26:00.000
leaped into the milk a ram you fell into the milk you shall have wine as your

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:07.720
blessed honor there's the wine as representing bakus and ritual celebrations await you under the Earth

02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:12.760
and all other blessed ones too now this is clear any classist will know this

02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:20.399
that dianis is all about resurrection diodorus of Sicily tells us stories about the resurrection of dionis as a

02:26:20.399 --> 02:26:26.000
child being torn apart this is predates Christianity by decades but being torn

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:32.640
apart as a child and then coming back to life as a moral as a son of a mortal

02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:37.960
semile seily is his second birth prapan is his first birth he has two mothers

02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:44.279
that's a resurrection so you can there's no way around that you just he just does not

02:26:44.279 --> 02:26:50.319
know what he's doing and I think if he if he want if he was smart he would stick to the Hebrew Bible stick to what

02:26:50.319 --> 02:26:56.680
you're good at and leave Classics the hell alone because you're just embarrassing yourself and I'm not this

02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:01.920
is just a this is just one% what I got coming out this is just a touch coming

02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:09.399
out oh God oh God that was so satisfying I don't know if it was your intention to

02:27:09.399 --> 02:27:16.200
take me to that climax but that was absolutely fantastic I don't know about

02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:23.120
the satanic congregation but okay this time type of feeding is something that

02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:28.560
you vampires have got to have right you've just got to have this look at it

02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:35.000
oh God it's it's so elegant right and it's just I got I got something I got

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:41.000
something to say about that if you don't get if you if when you hear uh a so-called

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:46.560
academic say something about a topic that you're that you're deeply

02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:52.840
interested in something that you study on your own I don't know maybe you're a fan of Plutarch let's say you're you

02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:59.040
love plutarch's lives and you've read the life of Anthony you've read the life of Demetrius you've read the life of

02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:05.359
ligus and Solon and you love these lies that plutar writes and then some some

02:28:05.359 --> 02:28:11.640
fresh PhD comes out they just got their PHD a couple years ago right and then you hear him speaking on this subject

02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:17.160
and you go oh cool an expert about talking about the subject that I love let's hear what they say if something

02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:22.319
they say doesn't piss you off then you don't have

02:28:22.319 --> 02:28:27.520
nosis it should you should be able to you should be able to hear something

02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:32.640
that someone else is saying and it should piss you off if you disagree with

02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:39.279
it it's a it's a code of honor it's a code of honor and Heracles

02:28:39.279 --> 02:28:45.560
had it and classical philologists have it and they can hear when something is

02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:50.680
off off and you are not representing those sources Faithfully

02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:57.120
so yeah I love that I I absolutely love it um what a meal what a delicious meal

02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:03.520
what I would like to know is um if you're gonna say anything about dionis

02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:08.840
and you don't understand that it was the

02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:14.359
aana that preserved that heart of dionis

02:29:14.359 --> 02:29:19.479
when he was sacrificed if you don't understand that bra you got no ears to

02:29:19.479 --> 02:29:27.800
hear that was going on way way long time ago and that visit to the Underworld the

02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:36.200
very fact I mean we have a the Greeks had a name right they had a name for the

02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:42.200
process of you getting high and going to the

02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:49.200
underworld and coming back and odys who was looking for the poison arrow or the

02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:56.479
arrow poison the beginning um he is the one who takes the trip and it's that

02:29:56.479 --> 02:30:02.960
woman Cersei who scares us all who turns she puts drugs in food she puts drugs in

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:10.399
food and she causes men to turn into pigs she's the one who shows adicus and people don't know it but she goes back

02:30:10.399 --> 02:30:16.840
she finds odyusa he goes home and she tries to sleep with his son so what

02:30:16.840 --> 02:30:21.920
happens she kills Odus and brings him back to

02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:28.720
life right she goes through the very same process they call it the

02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:35.600
NECA right the necromantic Oracle it's when you can project to the other side

02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:42.920
and be brought back right this is important because some people will try to distinguish between dying and

02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:49.160
resurrected and then a hero descending into Hades and returning to me that's not a that's that's a very minor detail

02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:56.000
to worry about what matters more is The Descent and the return which is what Christ was doing in his three days in

02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:02.720
Hades he was performing this katabasis and and the anabasis now hararia is one

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:09.279
of the big topics of this video that's about to come out because Dan has no idea about the Hilaria he's like he's never heard of it the he makes this

02:31:09.279 --> 02:31:14.399
weird face when Danny shows him the the the Hilaria he goes this was the halia

02:31:14.399 --> 02:31:21.800
they celebrated in Rome from from uh March 22nd and on the March 25th they had a day of rejoicing uh oh no I'm

02:31:21.800 --> 02:31:26.880
sorry March 25th was the day of blood and the day of burial and they Buri the

02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:33.760
pine tree and on the 28th and the third day or the 27th I think it was on the third day is the day of rejoicing and

02:31:33.760 --> 02:31:39.720
Dan goes he makes his face he goes that can't be right and by the way and I

02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:46.000
noticed and I played it back and I go I'm watching this and I'm playing it back when did Danny even make an

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:54.600
argument that Christianity was borrowing from the he never did it ever got brought up Dan mlen assumed because

02:31:54.600 --> 02:31:59.640
Danny was bringing up this Festival the F and it's it's fascinating the first

02:31:59.640 --> 02:32:05.399
thing you thought about was Easter Easter Easter he didn't even say Easter

02:32:05.399 --> 02:32:10.840
he never even brought up Easter all he all Danny this is so fascinating it's so

02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:16.120
perfect actually it's a perfect case study on Bible scholars that ATT Easter

02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:23.120
Danny that doesn't even say anything about Easter all he did was go here's the hararia this is what they did on

02:32:23.120 --> 02:32:29.680
this festival and Danny goes I've never heard that before that's that's that's complete mythicist nonsense the idea

02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:34.960
this was all and he Danny never even said anything about mythicism he never

02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:41.120
even brought it up yeah what does that tell you yeah tells you two things number one he's never heard of Hilaria

02:32:41.120 --> 02:32:46.960
before number two it it it bothered him to know that there was a festival that

02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:53.240
has another resurrection and it predates Christianity yeah and so by the last thing I want to

02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:58.640
say too guess what the name of the Greek version of the hararia was in Fria when

02:32:58.640 --> 02:33:03.720
they they they imported this rights from friia in 204 BCE we don't know what what

02:33:03.720 --> 02:33:09.000
happened between 204 BCE and I make this clear in my video by the time they get

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:14.560
it in 204 BC we don't know what what was going on we think it was the um we think

02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:20.439
it was in early April and not in late March and the the reign of in the reign

02:33:20.439 --> 02:33:27.800
of um not Kula in the reign of uh I just said it too um uh who's

02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:33.479
after in the reign of Claudius in the 40s 40s ad in the reign of Claudius they

02:33:33.479 --> 02:33:39.479
shift it and they turn it into the Hilaria so that's when you get and this is before the gospels this is during

02:33:39.479 --> 02:33:45.760
Paul was alive during this time period it's it's weird it's right after Jesus dies weird it's very eerie that they had

02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:52.160
this Festival imported in Rome and they end up shifting it the dates at first it was in the first week of uh April

02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:58.359
because id id mentions the Festival of Ky but it's the first week of April and

02:33:58.359 --> 02:34:04.160
he doesn't mention any resurrection of Addis the first time you start getting sources about the resurrection of Addis

02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:09.960
is Claudius and claudius's family was called the at Tides so they had this big

02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:16.640
deep Devotion to Addis that's why they did this now the question I wanted to ask you guess what the name of the Greek

02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:21.680
version of the hararia was called when it was when it was over in friia between

02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:26.800
204 and in the helenistic period let's say do you want to

02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:33.439
know okay okay no that wasn't what I was gonna say but yeah the

02:34:33.439 --> 02:34:39.080
cabia it's literally called The Descent Festival so that's how it literally

02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:44.920
proves that this was about a descent and a return so people who say oh we don't

02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:50.800
even know that there was a resurrection involved that early on that might have been a first centur thing second century

02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:56.399
thing well why is it called the the kabia then why would they name it that

02:34:56.399 --> 02:35:01.840
yeah I think the name alone tells us a lot that name speaks volumes does it

02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:08.640
makes no it's a absolutely perfect Point straight on and it's right in the language you can't deny it because

02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:14.640
you've got the language reflecting it so it's not like you can say like Dan usually does and say well that's

02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:21.160
different for the you know um there's two different worlds that we can treat here Pagan and Christan no no look at

02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:30.520
what the language is showing us right it's naming that right gorgeous now do you understand why

02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:39.040
uh Julian was saying you cannot let Christians teach Classics you can't let

02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:46.760
them do that um he Associated the teaching of Classics and it's corruption

02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:54.720
by Christianity and he considered that the reason for the fall right that was he

02:35:54.720 --> 02:36:02.960
was trying to fight that the very thing that you're doing with Dan ducktail Dan

02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:08.840
um that's amazing that's amazing G glorious job brother nice

02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:15.160
job another cult that Dan doesn't have any clue about because he's made he's made claims in the past that myth Russ

02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:20.640
Solen victus are two different two different Cults they're not the same cult that they're actually the same it's

02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:27.319
actually the same cult uh spoiler alert Mythos and by the way there are depictions of a Mythos and soulen victus

02:36:27.319 --> 02:36:35.800
as two different characters on the same Mosaic but that's actually more rare than it is to find one character of a b

02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:41.960
slaying God where it literally says Mithra soul and victus as one name that's the more common so it's more

02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:49.880
common than not I would say nine to one not 7 to3 not 6 to4 9 to one you find my

02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:55.240
soulen victus as one God and then a very on a rare few of occasions you'll see an

02:36:55.240 --> 02:37:01.760
image of mithos and it looks like a twin soul inv victus and they're both standing there so it's like but it's

02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:07.960
still the same cult it's still the Roman Imperial cult so you can't separate those two um anyways that's another part

02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:13.080
of the video um I noticed let me ask you a question religion he has no knowledge

02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:20.120
of Roman religion let me ask you a question I noticed you used the orphic plates and those are you know they're

02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:25.920
really thin but they like you say they put them with the dead bodies and they're very good

02:37:25.920 --> 02:37:34.120
instructions the instructions are the cult secret right the cult secret you're

02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:41.800
about it it's like Christ where you're you're crying out to Christ for help for Resurrection they're crying out to dianis for Resurrection dianis is the

02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:47.120
res it doesn't say Zeus it doesn't say Addis it doesn't say KY it doesn't say

02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:53.600
or oros it's a diis dead help me yeah think think about how important that is

02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:58.840
yeah you're going the thing that I found so beautiful the first time I read that

02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:04.960
was the fact that you're going you don't stop at Ley like everybody else does

02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:10.960
everybody else stops at Lethy and drinks and you know what happens Lethy is

02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:18.240
forgetfulness that's why you don't remember your last life you keep going and there is a phrase they say you'll

02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:26.080
come to these G and there is a phrase that you have to utter right those magical phrases that

02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:32.720
Jesus and the Magi are so well known for are coming from this death and

02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:38.560
Resurrection mystery that the orics are performing and I I don't want to say

02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:46.040
orix because it focuses on just orfus orus was just the fraking musician poet

02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:52.720
who works with media she's the one who starts the right he's the one who takes

02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:59.920
up the Poetry from it so yeah okay but I do want to say I do want to say when you

02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:05.120
get into that level where you're in the right and they're performing the right

02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:11.040
and you get technical terminology just like the catabasis that you just brought

02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:19.800
up you have to realize this is the terminology that's being used by the cult right so when you come across

02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:26.479
like sa sa sabba by the way deines in the fifth century or fourth Century BC

02:39:26.479 --> 02:39:35.880
what does he say in one of his speeches he talks about the cult of dianis and what does he say they chant iwa saah iwa

02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:41.600
sabba that's a dionan word it's talking sabba that's right there it mean it's

02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:47.800
it's like venerate venerate venerate yeah you know what I mean yeah that's and that's essentially what that verb

02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:53.080
means I've seen that verb a lot and essentially it means to reverence it

02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:59.840
means to put yourself into that position of reverence reverential awe you're in

02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:07.160
that it's like Divine Mania yeah you're August right oh there's

02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:12.920
that Holy Spirit Christianity it's the same thing holy that's what they're doing

02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:19.920
they're they're that's why I made this I made the point where it's like is Christianity a mystery religion well

02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:26.279
if we want to classify it that way fine yeah the reason why I'm saying and I say fine because I don't I think it's an

02:40:26.279 --> 02:40:31.560
arbitrary thing to even have that category because they're all all religions are sort of mystery religions

02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:39.000
in a way they all have some form of initiation they all have some some of drink some form of ritual um immersion

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:44.319
in some water some sort of baptism some sort of um holy Secrets some sort of

02:40:44.319 --> 02:40:50.720
like text right they're they all have those those factors so mystery religion Secret religion they're all they're all

02:40:50.720 --> 02:40:56.640
that way so Christian you forgot you forgot the dildos they've got

02:40:56.640 --> 02:41:02.840
and you forgot the penis shaped cups the juvenile talks about all the Baptists

02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:10.200
carry around you forgot the drugs you forgot the Chings you forgot all of

02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:16.319
that stuffy that's the inner mystery yeah that's for those who have ears to

02:41:16.319 --> 02:41:22.920
hear that's where you get the bits the bits in the fights those are the inner Mysteries yeah the outer Mysteries is is

02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:28.080
uh is Catholicism and uh Orthodoxy that's the outer mystery that's just go

02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:33.920
twice a year to church and get your community go home because you don't have ears to hear you don't you don't have it

02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:40.960
I've got a question for you I've got a question for you if you're Jesus and like Paul you've picked out your 12 boys

02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:47.920
and you're doing your christing thing and you're pushing The Thorn In the Flesh you're getting to that place where

02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:57.000
you're entering into the mystery with those boys do you do what he reportedly did

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:03.040
with Mary when he s when he pleasured himself and then offered to her his

02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:11.040
semen and said eat this or Die Do you think that the same thing if he's

02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:17.760
feeding here's my question now if Jesus will feed Mary his seman would he have

02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:23.160
fed his young students is seing too oh I

02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:29.600
thought if if we if if we were to go back in time and and join a borite elesia and see what they're doing down

02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:35.080
in those catacombs down deep in the cavern somewhere where the sun don't shine oh hell yeah they're doing that

02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:42.080
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is this is that and that and we're talking what's so crazy people say that's a late fourth Century Source yeah

02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:48.439
but did you read it he's talking about he's talking about a group from the first century yeah that's what he says

02:42:48.439 --> 02:42:53.760
yeah that's what he says and the greater questions of Mary was a first century document according to like you know

02:42:53.760 --> 02:43:00.560
according to what they're talking about so it's like even though the the source is late we don't have it that's we have

02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:06.240
to go through the source and it's like what you mentioned before about um Julian saying that we should not let the

02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:12.880
Christians teach the classics why because they're full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Justin Martyr Justin Martyr is

02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:18.520
trying to make the claim that the the the the mythus of mysteries of Mythos is

02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:23.920
copying Christ Christianity with their with their Eucharist and that mercury is called a logos because he's copying

02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:29.479
Jesus when we know objectively we can find Greek sources from The Classical

02:43:29.479 --> 02:43:36.319
period about Mercury about Hermes being called the logos and about we can find sources from the melanistic era about

02:43:36.319 --> 02:43:41.960
mithus giving or zoraster giving his Eucharist in honor of mithus that's in

02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:49.600
Plutarch by the way you also have uus but this is before Juliet so this is

02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:56.160
probably what Julian was talking about youus in the early around 4 325 ad

02:43:56.160 --> 02:44:01.680
somewhere like somewhere around this time he writes a book called the preparation of the Gospel what does he

02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:09.640
say in this book well in this book he does a lot of classic teaching he says Plato was inspired by Moses he says that

02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:18.120
orus was the son of Moses he says all this wild [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that has no basis on it

02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:26.160
and so Julian comes along two or three decades later and he's this is the world that he's in he's seeing people like Yus

02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:33.439
interpolating Josephus uh forging documents making up stories about Plato being inspired by

02:44:33.439 --> 02:44:39.399
Moses what is going and so I don't blame Julian they were they were doing some straight up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that would get you

02:44:39.399 --> 02:44:46.000
fired from a university if it would happened today there's no way usus would be would be a professor today he'd be

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:51.240
fired first day for doing all the forgery [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and the problem is they

02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:56.359
didn't and this will feed right into your Dark Ages they didn't just mess up

02:44:56.359 --> 02:45:02.640
classical civilization with respect to its cult they' messed up the

02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:10.040
science right it's not just that you don't want them telling history because anybody who's a member of a cult let me

02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:18.399
just explain anybody who's a member of a cult is not going to give you a straight story they're going to give you a bent

02:45:18.399 --> 02:45:25.399
story right the people who go into the Bic worship come out of it saying I'm born

02:45:25.399 --> 02:45:32.359
again why because they saw things right right that is the B of the

02:45:32.359 --> 02:45:38.800
initiate anybody who's been into Christianity has a bent and Julian

02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:45.359
recognized it and said it's an anti-classical bent it's going to take our stuff and it's going to destroy it

02:45:45.359 --> 02:45:51.160
and sure enough it did it did and you get Dark Ages Of Crap Art and crap

02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:57.479
literature it's not even literature yeah disappears The Stage disappears people

02:45:57.479 --> 02:46:03.080
say oh there's this type of play yeah when you got was some dorks that walk

02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:09.960
along a path do some clownery that's not the same thing they had all these God

02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:15.080
Greek sources there's all these different modes of music all these different ways to play the harp and the

02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:22.000
drums and they explain it there's the frian mode there's the Dorian mode there's the DIY rambos there's the pen

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:27.200
there's all these different different Triumph tunes that you can play they have all these different great music

02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:34.240
music is is blowing up right you have all these famous poets you have pindar you have Homer you have asilis you have

02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:39.600
Sophocles and they're doing comedy they're doing tragedy they're doing satire they're doing all these great

02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:45.680
stuff uh um and the world was very colorful and the architecture looks

02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:51.720
great cool Doric columns Corinthian columns temples dedicated to goddesses that look beautiful and everyone can go

02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:57.520
there and have a good time and enjoy the festival drink wine and have a everybody's living in this polus and

02:46:57.520 --> 02:47:04.240
civilization is kicking and then all of a sudden and by the way and this is the last and this is the other aspect of it

02:47:04.240 --> 02:47:11.520
you have Aristotle's philosophy which is updated on Plato's philosophy which is updated on uh uh Socrates which is

02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:17.800
updated on you know antines and phes and parites and uh heraclitus and there's a

02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:27.240
big line of thinking it's all updating itself updating itself updating itself socr or Aristotle sort of becomes Canon

02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:33.279
right and he's sort of just kind of gel people are just sort of jelling with Aristotle and Galen the medical side

02:47:33.279 --> 02:47:40.439
that's the philosophy side the science side on on the medical side you have galin which updates diores which updates

02:47:40.439 --> 02:47:45.479
hypocrates right and there's all these different updates of different textbooks that are coming out just like you see

02:47:45.479 --> 02:47:51.680
today in Academia new new new new Scholars comes along update the previous ones this is how the ancient Greek world

02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:58.279
was like what happened to that system gayen and Aristotle did not get updated

02:47:58.279 --> 02:48:03.520
until the 16th century did you know people don't even know this okay wait

02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:12.399
wait that's BR that's let me interrupt that's absolutely brilliant what you just noticed absolutely brilliant it was

02:48:12.399 --> 02:48:19.000
everything was set in stone gayen was the last guy that the steps or the

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:29.200
bridge included all the way up to like 1850 he dominated he dominated why why

02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:35.120
where's the stepwise progress yeah makes you think the main focus was on the

02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:41.880
church that was the whole world the whole world was centered around the church from the from from I want to say

02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:48.439
people people like you know you get uh Gibbon wants to say it's 476 I'll go farther back than that I'll

02:48:48.439 --> 02:48:55.439
say thirdd Century actually collapse of the third Century that's the end I think

02:48:55.439 --> 02:49:02.160
that's when it's it's just darkness from then on all the way until around like 1200 right before the Renaissance you

02:49:02.160 --> 02:49:08.960
start getting all these brilliant writers here's one for example Flavio Bondo Flavio is one of the texts

02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:15.279
I'm reading right now great he starts getting back into the classics he starts writing about KY and Addis and Adonis

02:49:15.279 --> 02:49:20.760
and Di he starts writing about all these ancient Cults again and it's getting back into the subconscious people again

02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:27.000
it's getting back people are reading about all the classic again but here's the point that I'm making is there was

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:32.200
no theater there was no Homer they didn't have esist anymore and then

02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:38.800
people so I've heard I've heard people argue oh they had classic tests in those periods okay let's I'll give you a 500

02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:45.640
year span I'll give you 500 years 500 AD to 1,00 ad what do you

02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:52.840
got um um uh B wolf oh really B wolf that's

02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:58.080
it you yeah no you get smelly stale Church

02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:04.760
fathers who suck nut those dis those are all dissertations on on the Trinity on

02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:13.399
on mother Mary and her divine nature on the nature of Christ on Christ in his flesh nature on on the Epistle of Paul

02:50:13.399 --> 02:50:18.439
on this text that's on the Epistle of Paul on Augustine on this they're all

02:50:18.439 --> 02:50:23.760
just writing about each other they're all just circlejerking each other about Christianity for

02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:30.279
500 years they're not doing Homer anymore they're not doing as they're not making tragedies anymore they're not

02:50:30.279 --> 02:50:36.960
having big festivals anymore in honor dionisis they're not doing games of Caesar anymore maybe they can't they

02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:42.120
can't no they can't because that jerk theodosius outlawed it they can't do

02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:49.160
anything they can't the oracles the oracles have shut down they can't do any of that stuff anymore they out

02:50:49.160 --> 02:50:55.120
outlawed outlawed frivolous laughter they said if you laugh too hard

02:50:55.120 --> 02:51:01.520
you're honoring dionis and that and that's the best picture this is what I'm bring this I'm

02:51:01.520 --> 02:51:09.640
bringing this to my debate uh for when iate the Dark Ages it's it's a decree from 609 ad in Constantinople it's a

02:51:09.640 --> 02:51:15.359
it's a it's a Papal or not a Papal uh patriarcal decree it's one of these

02:51:15.359 --> 02:51:21.359
councils of Trent or something I can't remember the name of it counil of something Council of whatever who cares

02:51:21.359 --> 02:51:26.880
and it says right in there the the if you if you are caught

02:51:26.880 --> 02:51:33.960
laughing hysterically while producing wine you can be arrested because that means that you're contributing to

02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:40.479
dionisis and they call him the abominal dionisis I love it he's the devil and I love it that's the devil that's Satan

02:51:40.479 --> 02:51:48.800
dianis is Satan but it's so about what he represents laughter fun joy ex love

02:51:48.800 --> 02:51:57.239
the world loving yourself enjoying life too it's a no-brainer it's a

02:51:57.239 --> 02:52:03.680
no-brainer it's hilarious it's hilariously simple exactly no I love it

02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:11.279
I love it what do you think is the key let me ask you this what do you think is the key to exposing because Dan and this

02:52:11.279 --> 02:52:17.600
sort of individual they're all over the place there's way more of them than

02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:23.399
there are of us so what do you see as a Way Forward well one thing I notic about

02:52:23.399 --> 02:52:29.600
people like that is they're not they don't seem generally interested in these subjects they seem more generally

02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:36.160
interested in pushing themselves up a ladder and running I'm gonna run for office it's all about me me me me me

02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:42.200
they're not trying to like contribute to like the knowledge base it's not like scholar like that's the one thing about

02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:49.680
people like James Frasier is they're genuinely trying to read read about the past get read about as many sources as

02:52:49.680 --> 02:52:54.800
possible come up with some sort of explanation of all this stuff put it all together so that you can read about it

02:52:54.800 --> 02:52:59.840
too today it's all about just like rubbing the right people the right way

02:52:59.840 --> 02:53:05.399
so that you can stay in the positive light and oh look how great this person is look how great of a scholar he is

02:53:05.399 --> 02:53:11.439
they just wrote about feminism in the Bible wow that's so so cool it's like that that's what's going on right now

02:53:11.439 --> 02:53:17.080
it's more about promoting yourself and making everyone look how great of a scholar you are rather than actually

02:53:17.080 --> 02:53:24.920
doing what scholar is supposed to do that's what I've noticed you it's called you tickle my Tain I'll tickle yours

02:53:24.920 --> 02:53:31.200
yeah your book deal you get your book deal you don't worry about who buys on Amazon because it's gonna get sold to all these universities and then they're

02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:38.319
gonna use that and then they're gonna and then then someone else's tuition is gonna go up because they gotta pay for that somehow and now now now you wonder

02:53:38.319 --> 02:53:45.000
why it's $100,000 to go to school yeah because every got all these professors who got their book Deals they get their

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:51.279
paid Transit so they can travel and go on vacation to Greece and enjoy themselves and not do any work while

02:53:51.279 --> 02:53:59.239
they're there grease and enjoy their free travel that your tuition is going to pay for right right it's a that's

02:53:59.239 --> 02:54:04.920
what the system is that's education right now it's a bit of a business you know what I mean it's a bit of a

02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:12.399
business and because it's a business their mouths are bound they are bound by

02:54:12.399 --> 02:54:17.680
certain things there's things that you and I discuss here can't talk about it

02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:25.960
there's no way I and I know for a fact there are classicists who hear it and they're like yeah yeah go you go I had

02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:31.239
somebody I had a professor write me a letter I had a professor write me a

02:54:31.239 --> 02:54:38.279
letter and say when everything was happening with them saying I couldn't talk about drugs and Antiquity saying um

02:54:38.279 --> 02:54:46.080
I've got a lot of respect for you I've got a lot of respect for you and I wish I could be public but I'll lose my job

02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:52.600
and I thought you know what that's uh that's a shame that the system is like that you know everybody thinks it's oh

02:54:52.600 --> 02:55:00.200
it's a bunch of liberals running a system of Mind mind alteration no you idiots

02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:07.920
you're just saying it because you've never been do you know what it is it's a business and people do they suck the

02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:14.720
butt that they have to suck in order to keep that cashola coming in and you know

02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:20.000
I have never met a professor never met a professor Professor who is a

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:25.960
tenur professor who didn't have a considerable number of nice things and

02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:32.479
was comfortable I've never met a tenure professor and the bigger the school the

02:55:32.479 --> 02:55:39.000
more Prestige did you smell the prestige on Dan the false Prestige it's a it's a

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:45.000
perfume they wear right the more Prestige you have the bigger your house

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:51.880
I'm not kidding you I've been in a lot of universities the people like that people like that you can tell that you

02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:58.000
had 15 years to just pay attention to school and be and be a a a scholar I

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:03.680
never had an opportunity like that I had to go to work in a factory I actually dropped out of college because I didn't

02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:09.640
have enough money to go there yeah I I couldn't get like I can't I didn't have someone paying for my college I didn't

02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:15.720
have a Forman family that just gonna you're gonna be a scholar like no nobody ever once's like are you getting a job

02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:22.600
there's a factory down the street that's open are you going to go there we need you you need to get a job you need to get out of like I had to work so like

02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:29.319
most people don't have the opportunity just to be a scholar and then take 15 years out of their life and rack up debt

02:56:29.319 --> 02:56:34.520
that they're not worried worried about and then just kind of sit around be on Tik Tok all day that's the most one

02:56:34.520 --> 02:56:39.880
privilege [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I've ever seen in my entire life and you can can see it it's

02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:46.359
obvious yeah it's obvious it WS it reeks so let's just say that it's corrupt and

02:56:46.359 --> 02:56:52.600
it's so it's so G filled that whatever the greed is going to tell you to do

02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:58.080
that's what you're going to do those are the kind of books you're going to produce and that's the kind of quote

02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:06.680
unquote scholarship you're going to produce look at somebody who's been through a theology training and they

02:57:06.680 --> 02:57:12.680
don't even realize these are people who are making comments about the

02:57:18.319 --> 02:57:24.960
own language that they're supposed to be studying I thought it was hilarious when the head of Hebrew University's Hebrew

02:57:24.960 --> 02:57:31.040
program that he works with the government that dude works with the government to set the modern Hebrew

02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:36.640
language right which is different it's got like 60,000 words I think was the

02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:42.319
last count okay that's good that's a lot that's a good amount he's the one who

02:57:42.319 --> 02:57:47.399
came out and he said in an article he said there's he said there's only 7,000

02:57:47.399 --> 02:57:53.880
I'll let him be the expert because he's the expert um I knew it was around 8

02:57:53.880 --> 02:58:00.319
,000 but he says there's really only 7,000 unique words so okay it's even

02:58:00.319 --> 02:58:09.439
lower than we thought um the fact that somebody can be sitting in front of you in a green t-shirt and can say to you

02:58:09.439 --> 02:58:16.520
this is the way it is it's 79 Point whatever dude you're in a you're you're

02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:28.720
that you can get taken into a back alley by these experts and these scholar the thing that was drove me crazy from that

02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:36.160
clip was the smug smile that he must have thought 70,000 but he really me he

02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:41.399
must have heard seven and thought 70 and he just was W you know or he must have

02:58:41.399 --> 02:58:48.200
heard 70 or what did he say seven yeah the other way around he must have heard 70 and thought seven and he got it all

02:58:48.200 --> 02:58:55.720
off H little does he know that smirk is for himself is he's the one that got it all up so that's why that smugness was

02:58:55.720 --> 02:59:03.560
like wow the the the the the the the confidence the PRI The Pride

me I don't care what you say this happens in the this in the 8th Century this is in the midst of the Dark Ages

03:00:48.520 --> 03:00:55.200
this the middle of the Dark Ages no more hilarity baby you got to shut down the

03:00:55.200 --> 03:01:04.200
hilarity you know they've got laws in the new plan of 2025 um they've they're gonna Force um

03:01:04.200 --> 03:01:12.319
anti-p pornography laws and they're going to say that even a discussion is forbidden right we're

03:01:12.319 --> 03:01:20.120
going back to those we're going back to those roots those medieval BS roots that

03:01:20.120 --> 03:01:26.479
we're gonna we're gonna have to live up to what do you think that's the last question I want to ask what's the secret

03:01:26.479 --> 03:01:33.200
here I know I like to come back to this frequently real Qui real quick on that yeah somebody recently somebody recently

03:01:33.200 --> 03:01:39.560
made a comment about Islam and they go that's some Stone Age crap right there

03:01:39.560 --> 03:01:45.960
because I guess was like a something about Islam like being terrorists or whatever that's some Stone Age stuff and

03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:53.200
I just thought to myself no the stone AG was actually very beautiful you had the worship of kubaba

03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:59.640
in the Stone Age you had the culation of the vine at the end of the Stone Age had Mano and cre at the end of the Stow age

03:01:59.640 --> 03:02:04.720
not manow and cre just yeah you know there was the let me finish this thought

03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:10.880
what they're actually referring to is the Middle Ages they instead of saying that's some Stone Age crap they should

03:02:10.880 --> 03:02:19.880
be saying that's some middle AES crap right there the Middle Ages worse Stone Age they did have we got to we got to

03:02:19.880 --> 03:02:25.399
recognize that there was a movement I somebody told me it was the abbasids

03:02:25.399 --> 03:02:30.800
check me if that's right or not but they were Building Man Muslim culture was

03:02:30.800 --> 03:02:36.800
building libraries at one point right building libraries and the only reason I

03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:44.239
know that I've got Muslim brothers and sisters who followed classical Antiquity

03:02:44.239 --> 03:02:50.680
is because they took authors like Galen and they translated them them into classical Arabic and the and

03:02:50.680 --> 03:02:57.040
unfortunately in a lot of cases the original galin was lost so the

03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:03.880
Arab Muslim abure the abis were the Golden Age were the ones who were

03:03:03.880 --> 03:03:10.239
bringing us classical you mention how classical stuff kind of percolates it was just as much classical for them and

03:03:10.239 --> 03:03:15.720
they loved it right you know and it was I that preserved Aristotle when the

03:03:15.720 --> 03:03:20.960
Greeks weren't or the God God Smarties

03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:27.120
and by the way that's that's the point that you just you just gave me my point when they say that's some Stone Age crap

03:03:27.120 --> 03:03:32.560
when they're talking about Islam you to be specific it's more to be more

03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:40.438
specific it's middle-ages Christian crap because that's what the Christians in the Middle Ages were acting like

03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:48.160
howest yeah it's monest it's monest and anytime you get mystical or mysticism

03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:55.160
that is influencing the monism it always creates a polytheistic escape and you

03:03:55.160 --> 03:04:00.200
get people who suddenly appreciate all of the Alchemy and things like that you

03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:07.399
get people who bring back the classics um it's the Cure of monism mysticism is

03:04:07.399 --> 03:04:13.160
the cure of monism the best thing that we can do is show people the rights that

03:04:13.160 --> 03:04:20.640
Jesus Christ himself is a part of And when they see that they'll know who they are the bad thing is is when you

03:04:20.640 --> 03:04:26.120
understand what Antiquity was actually all about and you're into that dirt and

03:04:26.120 --> 03:04:32.520
you see those drugs and you see those sex rights you know it puts you into a place that you have to question you have

03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:40.200
to question who the hell am I who the hell am I what kind of belief system do I have when did it evolve and where did

03:04:40.200 --> 03:04:47.520
it come from because you're not doing the original baby you're not doing the original thing that Jesus was doing

03:04:47.520 --> 03:04:53.680
right so yeah love it love it yeah I would I would argue that dios dios vault

03:04:53.680 --> 03:04:58.920
is the equivalent of Allah abbar because that's what they were chanting back in the Middle Ages when they were trying to

03:04:58.920 --> 03:05:04.640
go and Sack Jerusalem and take it back do Vault Doo vault is this say they're

03:05:04.640 --> 03:05:10.560
literally acting like that so the things that you're complaining about the things that you don't like about Hamas are the

03:05:10.560 --> 03:05:17.680
things that you're you're Christian uh forefathers were doing in the Middle Ages same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right exactly that's

03:05:17.680 --> 03:05:25.120
that's why I thought that line was Lucifer and the Tyrant was so important right always keep that in mind keep that

03:05:25.120 --> 03:05:31.560
what is that tyranny baby if you do you'll be free and I hope that you that's a perfect way to send you off

03:05:31.560 --> 03:05:38.479
because you're gonna go off to Florida I wish I was going with you you're gonna go off to Florida and you're gonna have
