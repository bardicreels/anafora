quantum yeah okay and that's how things change

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:03.839

library yeah she told him she told him yeah he buried him why did he bury him

00:47:11.559 --> 00:47:18.440
people are like why did Numa bury that stuff we're about to find out that he

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:27.079
was involved in a construction of past present and future out of the mouth

00:47:27.079 --> 00:47:35.920
of a singer prophetes Vestal who carried the

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:43.400
flame oh Jesus Christ what happened what happened when you drank that cup do you

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:51.559
remember I want to make this appeal to you tonight because the devil told me look you haven't really told them what

00:47:51.559 --> 00:47:56.960
the cup is um the the have to know you know he's

00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:05.880
like they got to know um that cup that Jesus said I don't want to drink from

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:12.839
it he's like yeah he's like I don't want to and he's stumbling right he's stumbling and

00:48:12.839 --> 00:48:19.960
his three stoned disciples Peter James and John are off there falling asleep

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:25.760
why you can only take so much opium right before it it knocks you out and

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:32.680
they're knocking he keeps trying to wake him up and go back to his naked kid who's in the middle of the garden with him right and he's like on his way back

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:38.599
there trudging he's like oh God I can't take it I can't take it anymore please don't let me have to do this do you know

00:48:38.599 --> 00:48:44.760
why he was saying that the devil wants you to know why he was saying

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:53.240
that yeah Christians close your ears because this is bad yeah yeah the

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:58.760
cup is the person in this case the

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:05.079
child using these drugs the body will then produce

00:49:05.079 --> 00:49:11.440
products and these products are Central to the functioning of the lay stas and

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:19.640
the Mystery you can't be a Christ without drinking from that cup and that cup is a

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:29.559
boy it's a naked boy it's a naked boy how do I know that because I've seen

00:49:29.559 --> 00:49:35.200
the cup of Zeus they call him

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:42.960
ganam you mean wait a minute um you mean he drinks

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:50.640
let me get this right he drinks from the boy yes he drinks from

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:55.799
the boy now they used to make fun of this um

00:49:55.799 --> 00:50:03.040
in the pric poems yeah they used to make fun of it right drinking from ganam you know what

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:09.359
that means you that's um in case you're not getting the exact scientific

00:50:09.359 --> 00:50:16.359
historic picture of Jesus and his boy cup he's

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:24.440
drinking from his private yeah

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:31.760
yeah one author talks about

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:39.839
the springs theer in the nether yes I don't know how to describe

00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:50.319
this in the most scientific way possible so that you can understand the Bible but these texts indicate the

00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:58.440
anus colon was a a place for the storing and processing of goods that could

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:05.960
be put to use in rights with people who were um

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:14.720
interested in drinking from the anus of a child when Jesus Christ I know it's I I

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:20.200
I hate this part but you have to look at the reality no no matter how painful it

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:27.920
is when Jesus Christ with that naked kid is drinking of his

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:34.559
cup yeah it included um

00:51:34.559 --> 00:51:42.280
anal anal consumption yeah yeah huh now you know

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:47.839
why those Crusaders do they have that purple cross on their little

00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:54.040
underwear yep don't you did you know that J you

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:59.240
didn't know oh everybody knows it it was in the trials of the of the uh

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:05.200
Templars yeah the Templars they had the little purple crosses because it was the

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:11.319
way that their anus that had been coated with these christing drugs I mean you

00:52:11.319 --> 00:52:17.880
don't know people until you stood there as a Templar as this Christian order and

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:27.240
you get your newbies in and what do you do with your newbies you say you can have one of two locations from my drug

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:33.400
comes yeah that's just that's how it works man that's how it works did you

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:38.920
think that was odd well the pope did and ended up smashing those people right he

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:46.720
was like [Laughter] no it was money there was money behind

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:52.000
it you know what I mean you know it's the way it is the apostles were the boys

00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:00.760
from Galilee The Boys From Galilee is that a go you people exactly who is this MC this

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:08.079

thing down step away step away from the King James they're going to burn him now

00:53:21.559 --> 00:53:26.640
wouldn't that be funny you get a mob of Christians holding signs say spare the

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:33.839
children while they pay to have children killed isn't that neat and by not helping children not get killed you're

00:53:33.839 --> 00:53:40.520
essentially endorsing the killing of them right so wake up wake up you're in

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:45.880
