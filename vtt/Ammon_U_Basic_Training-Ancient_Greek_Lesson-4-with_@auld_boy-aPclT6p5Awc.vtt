00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.040
you please formally introduce I know a lot of the lady babon folks already know

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:18.160
you right but give yourself an introduction that you want to give the world and you won't be interrupted by

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.759
any commercials or anything like that go for it well uh thanks for having me here

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:32.080
first off you know it's great to uh to be able to to speak to everybody and um basically um I've been through the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.520
Intensive course um under under Amon and um it's been such a great experience you

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.400
know in I think we've been studying around about just under a year and a half and going from not even being able

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.160
to um read the letters to now being able to go and uh research texts and start

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.479
translating you know sections of them and presenting them you know it's been a liberating experience so you know thank

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.639
you for the time that you put in to uh to taking me through that

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.840
process it's been a great job that you've done right you you you marched

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.880
through the basic training and now you're working with the text and I saw

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.639
one of your vides the other day one of your vide the other day and it was gorgeous you broke down you quoted the

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:29.160
Greek I was like this giant nerd I love it and um so that Drew you that Drew you

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.919
to the purple tell us a little bit about your purple Quest so um as you know they um they

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:43.880
found a chunk of the the purple at the excavation of a bath house it was very close to to where I I lived and grew up

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.360
so I thought you know what I'll get in touch with him I'll um I'll see if I can go down there get on site um put

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.039
together a little um short documentary and they got back to me and said yeah that's going to be cool so you know that

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.280
was arranged and then I thought well why not um piece together a miniseries

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.680
looking at texts that mention the origin of it um the medical um applications of

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.639
it you know and then the cult uses as well and then I thought you know I can just translate some chunks of texts and

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:20.680
um and piece them together with some scenery um nearby where I live and just pres present them so and as well it's

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:28.240
good for me because it gets me diving into those texts it keeps me reading every day because as you know um it's

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.599
something you need to be doing every day because it does slip out of the brain and um and it keeps me focused it keeps

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:40.280
me going and it keeps me uh looking at Greek text so it's a win-win all around

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.880
yeah what you hear is discipline right everybody's watching I'm and you tonight

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:52.880
Who's got your book this is discipline that old boy is uh exhibiting here um

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:59.800
this is an example to follow now he's talking he's running down archaeologist can you believe that running down AR

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:06.319
olist and talking to them about they told you they found some more didn't they yeah that's right so that that

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:13.560
hasn't you know hit them hit the media or anything yet so it was uh Frank jeo who's the um the the person overseeing

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.800
the Dig I managed to get a short five minute uh interview with him and um I said I was obviously interested in it

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.639
and he he kind of had a little smile and he went we found another piece you know so yeah I was very excited to get that

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:33.080
news and share it with you all so yeah they found another another piece look at that look at that a scoop a scoop you

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.960
got the story there and you know what I'm sure he'd love talking with you I'm sure it was like a you know something

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.520
neat you know what I mean because somebody here you are and you're interested and you've got the background

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.639
to be able to work with the Tex and stuff wow that's impressive and it's

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:58.000
isn't it liberating old boy when you can actually work with those primary texts yourself yeah it's absolutely incredible

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.520
you know when I was first getting interested in this kind of stuff I would be researching trying to compile texts

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:10.599
some of it would be in Latin some of it would be in Greek and you're there going I just wish I knew what it said and now

00:08:10.599 --> 00:08:17.800
that I've been through that process you know I can just get a piece of text I can be there with the the text a lexicon

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.319
using uh Alice and then I can I can work through a translation yeah good and you've got

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:29.039
your SM grammar in case anything gets funny out in the bush tell us oh look at

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:35.839
that tell us um uh where do you go from here do you I know that you're

00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:41.479
interested in some things like gelic or like um you were going to go up north

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:48.080
maybe and study some uh oh what were you into was that Norse right Norse tell us

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.480
what is the future and how do you see you know using your classical

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.800
studies well um obviously family life was a little bit hectic it's quite Tien

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.920
down a bit now so I can um I can focus on on moving forward with the Greek

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:11.120
still do want to pursue the runology that is um an interest of mine you know I'm always tracing down the origin of

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:17.320
where these uh these runic scripts came from um right now I just want to be able

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:24.240
to look at texts and just um I think it's it's a nice little um package that

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:30.480
I found that I can I can deliver uh to people where I can translate a text go around some scenery because I've got

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.839
some amazing historical sites on my doorstep and I can join the two together and just and just present them so I'm

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:42.760
happy doing that and you know that's that's what excites me and as I said it keeps me reading the Greek and that's

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.920
that's something I want to develop to the next level so I love that I absolutely love that and I know you're

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.000
going to end up integrating a whole bunch of different stuff and I um you're

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
going to end up being one of those polyglots and uh you know more power to you you know that's inside of some

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.800
people they don't realize it's in there maybe you got a little inclination along the way somewhere but man that language

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:15.160
work just brings out just brings out the beauty fantastic so we should all check

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:23.360
out old boy and you know um support him as somebody who's coming forward and uh

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.680
picking up those sources right you could be getting you could be getting in the back alley with you know who you know

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.440
what I mean you're not going to get that you're not going to get that back alley with all boy he's going to give you the

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.800
stuff baby and look at him you know what he's he doesn't have to defend his

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.240
professor's position and be careful about what he says the dude is into the

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.560
texts and the the reality that's what I like and all boy you were an excellent

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:58.639
excellent student um and everybody here should look up to you right yeah yeah

00:10:58.639 --> 00:11:04.680
was give give everybody a final say what's on your mind and um and uh we'll

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.440
let you go all I would say is you know um have faith in the book the um the

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:16.200
Hansen and Quinn's an incredible uh resource you know mine is literally

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.399
still bookmarked you know it's I still refer back to it all the time I use that

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:28.880
in conjunction with the uh the SMI Greek grammar and obviously Alice and um just

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.519
trust the process identify your verbs first um that's all I do when I go into

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:40.440
a text I just identify everything and then work from there as long as you identify everything that's a great

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:48.560
starting point to go go um a great starting point to start from so you know stick with it um it's worth it and um

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:56.000
you know it'll change your life and it'll change your mind so yeah thanks guys we would probably get a full class

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.880
if I were um in the position to be able to bring a summer intensive course I

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:08.880

Corners here's where I want you mentally think of the Four Corners we're in the right and the angulos the messenger is

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:44.240
giving us the mystery and the Mystery starts with the Restraint of the Winds

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.759
and if you are living in Antiquity and you are reading

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:57.800
Greek you know the science behind the winds what are you ignorant my god let's

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.600
show you right what is he say he's doing all this what are the Angels doing they're restricting that

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:10.400

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:19.199
next one what are we doing what are we doing People Media the architect of the first

00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:29.919
mystery in Western history Mia is the one who created a right

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:37.640
whereby you could Transit this life death barrier and in that right is this

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:43.080
science of the Winds media wrote hymns

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:49.559
to the winds and if you don't understand that it's because you haven't been initiated and you don't have ears to

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:56.640
hear are you ready you know what this is doing this isn't just Greek that I'm showing you this is Greek that is using

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:05.919
cult code and that code was found and declared and titled in the early 1900s

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:12.120
by a dude a dude classical scholar that's what all the great German

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:17.440
classical Scholars were doing their thing like in the 1920s and 1930s right

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:24.120
oh God they were so ahead of the game and this one German dude comes along and

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:29.640
he says there's a code in the orphic it's called the Vox

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:37.480
right it's the voice well these texts that I'm showing you are using that

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:43.600
code yes yes you mean a throne isn't the throne

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:49.240

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:28.880

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:34.360
right are you ready where' they all go right okay what

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:40.159
is this corner of the earth what am I throwing at you now right I'm throwing

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:46.440
at you more Greek and what does this Greek say it says just like that Rising

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:52.200
those locations where you have the rising on the corners those Corners

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:59.679
those cardinal directions right from which the winds

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:06.159
are derived they come they blow over everything they have their

00:20:06.159 --> 00:20:13.280
AR in the corners okay so remember we've taken the

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:19.799
drugs we're talking to the Angel and the angel is giving us the

00:20:19.799 --> 00:20:26.320
scientific at the time the scientific explanation of what's going on and where

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.840
is this from this is tmy this is Tommy's

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:38.200
tetrabiblos and in it Tommy is mapping out the science that is

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:44.760
behind everything you're seeing in the apocalypse so when

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:52.520
mons fundamentalists draw pictures and the pictures look clownish

00:20:52.520 --> 00:21:00.080
this is why they they don't understand the text because them they haven't dissolved the

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.799
seals they haven't applied the seals here what does this say right that's

00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:10.840
where it has its origin right then he talks about the rising the next one

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:19.159
here's this here's another part people what does this say it's moraly he says these winds right they come from this

00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:25.120
location and they're commonly called the southern winds they're very warm and

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:31.000

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:49.560
[Music] Vice okay wait a minute I don't know I

don't know is this line bugged I don't know about this one but don't worry

00:38:55.400 --> 00:39:01.280
because one of our sources is Lucian on this and Lucian is very happy to tell us

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:06.319
exactly what it means give me the next text and let me show you it means to

00:39:06.319 --> 00:39:11.440
lesbian Zan right so what is going on here in

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:17.760
this text somebody's being talked about as doing this type of activity to lesbi

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:23.240
adzo and to fornido right and to for what does it

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:28.359
still mean to do well you know what the lesbiano is right um let's check it

00:39:28.359 --> 00:39:34.079
chewy just for the people who want implicitly to do like the lesbian women

00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:39.880
well what does that mean seriously Lesbos is an island baby

what are what are those mellenium doing I don't know um on Lesbos what do you do

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:53.720
that's so well maybe the Latin will help us look fare

00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:01.359
F oh right now that's the wrong word isn't it I think it is because fi means to do

00:40:01.359 --> 00:40:10.319
certain things with uh the mouth to produce some what became known as

00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:15.640
filatio felatio and a Fator listen to the listen

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.880
to The Latin a Fator is somebody who performs

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:29.920
filatio yes um fantastic so that's to Les that's to do the Le boss thing yeah

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:37.000

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:53.920
unnatural part okay now I want you to look at this text and I'm just going to

00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:04.040
translate it to you and I want you to create the mental image that you can fire cannot extinguish

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:09.359
fire there is a moist

00:41:09.359 --> 00:41:17.880

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:10.280
the next one um so what are these phical Bap uh bapto what do they do um this is

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:15.520

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:23.440
baptized right and um bring out that light okay do you still have the do you

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:30.520
still have the voice are you still using the voice um who are these people that we talk about these are the furies baby

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:37.680
these are the furies who are going to become humanties they're going to become humidities and the chorus tells us oh

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:47.040
Earth you bore this group this generation of serpent tooth

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:52.920
nourished people and what are they what are they accompanied by they're

00:50:52.920 --> 00:51:02.920
accompanied by a theot trophic dragon with purple on his drooling down his

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:09.559
forehead wait what did you just say anthropologically we've got a group of

00:51:09.559 --> 00:51:15.200
people these are thebans and everybody knows that the thebans are born from the

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:23.599
tooth of the serpent all right that tooth is that stinging it is that plague it is the

00:51:23.599 --> 00:51:30.040
insertion of the poison and that poison is carried by a

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:38.920
dragon and remember the Greeks told us themselves when they say dragon they don't mean Dragon they mean a person who

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:45.880
is a dragon and what is a dragon dragon guard dragons guard monuments they guard

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:51.400
temples of with that have relics right any kind of Relic that's

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:57.200
what dragons do they protect relics and what do these dragons have they got the

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:03.400
purple coming down their forehead into their

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:10.440
eyes what does the purple do it blinds them but at the same time it allows them

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:15.720
to see the invisible right imagine that your dragon

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:21.599
who is guarding your Relic can see what you

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:28.480
can't everybody in Classics used to always say why is it why are the dragons

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:34.040
always blind why are those seers always

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:41.400
blind yeah guess what people those drugs fill you with

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:47.920
light no you thought you just wanted to be healed of your depression right they

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:53.440
didn't they didn't stop there they not only healed you your depression they filled you with

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:59.839
light oh god oh god let's get another one let's get another

00:52:59.839 --> 00:53:04.920
one yeah okay go give me the

00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:12.480
next finally um what is um what is Mary the mother of

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:21.000
Jesus who is she she is the fulos that Crimson fingered one right

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.280
that Crimson fingered one why does she have that dye on her hands

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:32.760
why does she have that it's because of the group that she's with right she came

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:38.720
right out of the temple you you and I were all there we saw when they auctioned her off everybody brought

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:45.680
their umbrella in and some kind of Rod they were using and you they picked out one at random gave her ding ding ding

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:53.799
you win Bingo right it's virgin Bingo fantastic but she was pregnant at

00:53:53.799 --> 00:54:00.200
12 maybe that's why they kicked her out one of those angels that fed her yeah

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:05.280
didn't bring the right stuff because they're supposed to prevent that right

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:10.839
you're supposed to be able to prevent that in your priestesses right not only that but she could have had an

00:54:10.839 --> 00:54:17.359
STD right because if they're not using the drugs that the Greeks are using in the right that prevent pregnancy they're

00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:22.599
probably also not using the drugs that cause you to um that help you to keep

00:54:22.599 --> 00:54:29.119
from getting STDs yeah yeah so she probably had STDs too

00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:38.520
pregnant and STDs oh poor Mary maybe that's why they paid her so much maybe they paid the they didn't pay

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:44.599
the mother of Christ how dare you blaspheme yeah they did I saw them gave

00:54:44.599 --> 00:54:52.920
her a bunch of golden drugs yeah they did why ah they saw his

a nominative case I don't want you to worry too much right

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:33.880

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:46.560
something is a nominative a genitive A dative or accusative now you students at

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:53.000
amenu who are doing the Greek and who will progress through the course you are

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.440
investigators you are investigators this Machinery is

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:06.840
logical and you must have it memorized you must know that an ADA by itself is a

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:13.360
nominative an ADA Sigma is a generative you must know that this is

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:22.080
just logic it has nothing to do with your ability to be smart or not nothing

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:28.600
to do with brains simply remembering these forms you have to be able to recognize it now if you're lucky and you

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:35.840
have an identic memory you look at that one chart one time and boom if you're like me you got to run that course over

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:41.560
and over again until it's in your brain automatically

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:48.960
repeti repetition is the mother of learning says Cicero we must repeat these things if I

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:55.239
were in your house I would bring my Whip and I would force you to repeat these

01:12:55.239 --> 01:13:02.159
over and over until you were sick of hearing them that's how you do it that's how you do it yeah a lot of people like

01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:08.080
to write it out write it out engage your hand right um good give me the next one

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:13.560
what else do we need to know we need to know there are masculine and neuter nouns and the First Column here is

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:19.960
masculine logos the last column is neuter doron so if you memorize that

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:27.159
First Column and that last column you'll be in good shape look at the ending o oi on and

01:13:27.159 --> 01:13:32.480
don't worry about the vocative I don't want you memorizing the vocative that little vo at the bottom forget that for

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:40.120
now look at the plurals oi on o memorize those endings masculine in

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:45.600
the plural oi on o what is the what is the neuter in the

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:51.199
plural a on o a right how do I have to think of that

01:13:51.199 --> 01:13:56.840
no I need you to get it to where it's muscle memory where you can jerk that up

01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:05.159
just out of nowhere where your wife can come to you in the shower and smack you and you can yell out ah a

01:14:05.159 --> 01:14:11.400
a right why why did you shout out paradigms well somebody was flogging you

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:16.679
well you know it's the thing we do make it an exercise family building exercise

01:14:16.679 --> 01:14:23.480
love it the Bic family the family that whips together stays together yes

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:29.679
fantastic fantastic let's go to the one underneath that did he tell them to do what I think he told

01:14:29.679 --> 01:14:37.880
them no people okay let's let's do this the

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:43.520
right way this is the last chart that you need to know from this chapter it is

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:52.760
your what is this oh my God it is your what H he to

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:59.040
it's the word for the it's the word forthe it's called what's the nerdy name

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:04.560
for it you know they always come up with sexy nerdy name for things the definite

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:10.239
article are you the definite article I think I'm the definite article in the world

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:17.840
of in the world of grammar almond is the definite article I like that don't you

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:25.080
chewy I like that Chewy was mad tonight because she was watching with the rest of us she was watching and she was like

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:32.239
really this guy has a PHD and I said yes

01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:38.880
dear but it's in Theology and bible studies right this is why you don't have

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:46.800
international conferences with classes and bible studies professionally this never happens why do biblical Scholars

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.960
never show up at International Classics

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:58.120
conferences you know for classical Greek why do they never show up because you

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:06.000
know um if you're how do I put it simply if your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] isn't good enough you know

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.840
um you're gonna look silly and so they know not to show up it's amazing the

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:17.360
level the level of professionalism with Biblical Scholars is grossly you know

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:26.080
it's just people overestimate it but H whatever um here's your definite articles memorize these H to Toyon ho to

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:33.800
he tast tone to to to t to right when you can say that to

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:40.800
yourself and you can keep in your brain remember you're keeping in your brain nominative genitive dative accusative

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:47.120
and you say I don't want to do that I don't care stare at this chart until it

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:52.840
becomes part of your mind until subconsciously you're bringing up images

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:58.040
of definite articles Chang in through the cases moving and that definite

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:05.120
article becomes a sexy beautiful lady and what does that sexy beautiful lady do she changes she changes through being

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:12.280
the subject to being she who possesses to being she for whom something is done

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:20.239
to she who is the object of the action right follow this nominative

01:17:20.239 --> 01:17:28.280
genitive dative accusative please this is what you must know for unit one for

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:34.760
unit one now I'm going to give you a couple of sentences really quick and then we're going to call it and you're saying wait a minute you didn't spend

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:41.760
enough time on that are you ready if you've done everything I've just told you to do you

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:48.320
will be ready now go run do it ready here we are with the with the exercises

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:52.920
look at number n

01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:03.760
homos homos is in the nominative case so that's your subject your verb is P that

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:09.080
way so Homer teaches who does he teach he's got to teach somebody in the

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:14.440
accusative case because that's what the verb is acting on and here we've got

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:20.840
adelon in the accusative case Homer teaches his brother what does

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:27.280
he teach him Tech you got a dative little dangling data there don't you hate when got a little dangling data you

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:34.400
just want you know just kind of push it and it falls off the tree you know what I mean that's your dative you want to

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:41.880
pick pairs here's your dative Tech with

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:46.960
skill when you're translating datas I don't want you to think about it

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:52.480
they're the indirect objects I don't want you to think about it I want you to say how am I going to translate this I'm

01:18:52.480 --> 01:19:00.080
going to translate this as two four or with two skill no that sounds stupid four skill ah sounds stupid with skill

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:06.199
aha there's one don't try to figure your way out of this jungle just do exactly

01:19:06.199 --> 01:19:11.280
what I say and you will survive this war good

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:17.239
fantastic um look at number 21 homos there he is again he looks like he's in

01:19:17.239 --> 01:19:24.960
the nominative case so I'm gon to make him the subject homos jump two words and get pway there's your verb Homer teaches

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:30.960
what what does he teach ton phone he teaches his brother now here's the

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:38.840
problem you have two accusatives can you have a double accusative in Greek yes you can teach somebody something and the

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:46.120
verb is still acting on both of them it's acting on his brother and the thing at the same time what is he teaching him

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:51.960
technine skill you see how skill is in the accusative case because the verb is

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:58.239
acting on it everything in the sentence you could jumble this thing and throw it in the air and it could land in all

01:19:58.239 --> 01:20:06.000
different order and it would still mean the same thing do you see how solid Greek is your English is based on word

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.639
order you use an inferior operating

01:20:11.639 --> 01:20:19.120
system yeah you do but that's okay we're here to give you the new one this is a much better operating system okay and

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:25.239
what is the bio doing well he teaches them with books

01:20:25.239 --> 01:20:30.719
what are the means those are the books yeah how are they learning they're

01:20:30.719 --> 01:20:37.800
learning through the books feel that dative that dative sets those

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:43.080
circumstances it's very you know it's going to tell you how is this action

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:48.360
being implemented biblo with books baby right

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:55.239
love it okay kind of sneaks in there kind of kind of catches you off guard all right here's what I wanted do I want

01:20:55.239 --> 01:21:02.320
to stop there and what you can do is the sentences at the end of the chapter I

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:09.080
should cover enough of those to hit every point that you that that unit is

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:17.560
trying to make so if you go back and play those you will get every point that the unit is trying to make to you and if

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:24.320
you can translate those sentences you're performing at maximum

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:30.239
good job those of you who are doing this and eating it up because I'm getting some email from people saying this is

01:21:30.239 --> 01:21:37.920
too slow I just want to run ahead restrain yourself perfect your unit one

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:43.480

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:50.600
an anthropos is do you understand you love it you love this stuff okay okay I
