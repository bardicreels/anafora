four things that are happening right now this is what I'm telling you there are four things that are happening right now

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:27.680
that are making it possible for us to reac

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:34.199
access that classical civilization that reality and here it is here's the one

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:41.520
Christos they can't go Toe to Toe with Christos they can't go toe-to-toe with

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:47.759
it even their people who do Greek are scared of Armen they're scared of almond

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:54.240
did you know that give me the next one the L days they're trapped they're

00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.759

recover from and again it is

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:13.639
indefensible it's indefensible right this what we're talking about causes they're socalled

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:23.840
Scholars to run to run literally in an in a match oh my God run away go

00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:36.200
art you shouldn't have stepped in it unless you knew what you were doing

let's go is he is he back here pull him up get him out here Jesus by the way

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:48.040

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:55.839
four things that I was going to tell you about tonight another one the purple they can't get rid of the purple and

00:08:55.839 --> 00:09:03.079

00:09:03.079 --> 00:09:09.880
with a naked boy they cannot turn

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:18.240
away with the text itself we can take them down do you see

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:24.800
there is an antichrist to the Christ fantastic I love it hey get that

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.959
kid away from Abraham is he doing that again look right

00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:35.800
oh and one more one more chewy saying look we'll just do these since we're going to jump into Neil the forgery of a

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:43.079
Hebrew text you know what else is making a huge Splash that people are looking around saying oh my

00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:49.240
God right and everybody's saying because they don't know um because they don't know

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:55.680
everybody's saying um well no no nobody has ever said this this man is a cook

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:04.399
right no I am not a c I am a thief and a

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:12.519
cheat I take these gems from The Muse I take these gems from The

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:19.040
Muse and a dude she brought me Julius Africanus he's an ancient dude he's

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:25.000
writing to origin very famous Christian and what are they writing about they're writing about this exactly what I'm

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.000
talking about the Hebrew is a forgery the original is great break it's not my idea it's something

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.839
right out of an Antiquity and why is it even a concern at this time because this is when the forgery is taking place this

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:46.160
is when they're trying to pass off a false history and who is doing it

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.200
zealous monists just like the followers of aanan

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.600
just like the followers of

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:04.320
Jesus where is he where is he what's that God what's that Abraham kill

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:11.920

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.950

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:41.920
[Laughter] kidding am little I'm using a a stock

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:48.240
camera right now it doesn't even look that bad me me me your stock camera is going

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.440
to look better than my 8 Mbps internet

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.800
um here's what I want to do I want to show some three Clips I want to show

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.920
three clips and here's what I want to do this is different for satanic initiation

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:10.079
but here we go are you ready I want to show you three clips and I want your

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:17.680
responses as the person who's sitting there I just want to ask you a couple of questions about you know how you feel

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.560
right um let's go to the first one chewy are you ready here we go hit it to get

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:29.000
into some of the details of the things that I noticed about his mistakes just to be completely upfront we can get into

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.480
some we can get into details about this I do not think that Dan has even a bachelor's level knowledge of the

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:41.079
classics and that's just my that's I could be wrong that's just what it looks like to me right it looks like when it

00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:46.600
comes to Roman religion Greek religion mystery Cults platonism Greek philosophy

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:52.199
Greek mythology it looks like he is barely an amateur in this in this field and he's out of his element and he'll

00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:58.560
make statements like you know he'll respond to a video online or something and the video might be complete nonsense

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:06.000
he might be be fair to be criticized in this video but then he'll say things like there are no no sources anywhere

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.160
that say x and I can find a source that says X the question shouldn't be is

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:16.560
there a source that says X the question should be does X influence why in these

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.680
Christian texts it appears to me that Dan is out of his element when he gets into the classics realm but I do want to

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:29.360
make it very clear this guy is a Bonafide expert in Hebrew Bible of course or or even Christianity or or or

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.600
judeo Christianity in general want to make somebody's thinking that I'm trying to say he doesn't know anything at all

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:42.000
like whoa no not at all yeah yeah yeah I'm glad you're correcting just want to make sure cuz I I was just criticizing a lot but I want to make sure people

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.079
understand that I know this guy knows what he's doing he's been trained he's under stav R aulu and he's oh my gosh

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:54.360
this guy's a legitimate expert in his field try to make that

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.959
clear a a legitimate expert in his field

00:13:59.959 --> 00:14:06.800
right but his knowledge of Classics is not what you thought it should be or

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.040
what at least it was presented as which I gathered meant was pretty bad now

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:18.040
here's my question for you how do you feel standing there in front of this

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:27.160
person because it's really Dan and Dan's Dan's man is asking you now why Dan why

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:33.320
the harsh treatment of Dan um Neil this is my question for you were you there

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:40.920
pounding those sources because you were there for a reputation or maybe because of the work

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:47.160
you do at a university somewhere were you do were you there were there any

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.600
motives that had you there besides just getting those sources out that's really

00:14:52.600 --> 00:15:00.000
what I want to know no you actually uh sort of said it in the question that's I just want to

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.320
learn the sources and I want to um know what's out there um so like I said if I

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.920
don't I'm I don't have a PhD in anything in particular but I can say this

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:16.120
confidently I have a little bit of knowledge of Greek a little bit of knowledge of Hebrew I can read text I

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:22.600
can look words up I can look through different um lexicons and find out things and compare sources read I can

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:28.120
also read articles that from from Ruck or you or or Bible scholars in the

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:36.519
whatever I got I have access to that in my fingertips we have uh percus tus we have Topo text we have lowb which I

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:41.759
subscribed to I can read any bilingual text in Greek or Latin right now and

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:48.199
look at both sides the Latin the Greek or the and see what the English translation is what the trans I know we

00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:56.519
don't live in the world like the 1500s anymore in the 1500s if you were just some random farmer you didn't read text

00:15:56.519 --> 00:16:02.720
you had to go through the church or the library or whoever the keepers of the

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:09.680
library depending on what city you're in I'm just I'm just guessing right now today is different today anybody can

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.639
learn ancient text you don't have to have a PhD to learn ancient text and then guess what you can have an opinion

00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:20.759
on those ancient texts period that's it that's it's that simple I have an

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:28.120
opinion on these texts and this is what I think because I've read them I can confidently say that I don't have to be

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:33.600
nobody can get Gaslight me and tell me I'm misrepresenting them or something or didn't I didn't actually read them and

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:40.199
I'm just making things up that that can't be done because I know I've read them period so when someone comes along

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:47.240
and pretends to say that they've read them or that they understand these things and they just sound way out of their element I can tell I don't need to

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.360
have a PhD or doctor to do that that's that's just objectively true so you

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.800
challenge me all you I'm wait someone someone challenged me on this stuff I'm just waiting for it you know I if I'm

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.360
wrong you can teach me then then the the PHD can teach the amateur and then

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:11.959
everyone's happy because because you're because because it's education it's right isn't that exactly exactly exactly

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:17.760
and all you're doing is saying don't step up there and say hey this word is

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:25.079
not an occurring in any texts around it or anything and then say Oh who's Lucian

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:30.520
who the okay what you've done is look people what look say congregation what

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:37.559
what Gnostic has done is absorbed those sources and in the process of absorbing

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:44.720
those sources he's getting a sense that he can tell very rapidly whether or not

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:51.919
somebody really um has done the work and really knows these things and is in the

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:59.480
sources and the problem is the problem is when people pretend

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:06.159
they are and say they are um they mislead they mislead um there's

00:18:06.159 --> 00:18:14.480
something very F I thought this was hilarious Neil somebody came somebody did a reputation video video of me I

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.880
think it was Kip and he said something like and some other genius but he said

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.039
something like oh this is um this is what happens when you don't know more

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:31.480
than one language which is hilarious because it shows me that you don't even

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:37.679
recognize that classical philology is the study of Greek and Latin right when

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:42.720
you were supposed to be an expert about the

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:57.880
septuagenarian philologist he does not read Greek he has no place to make any sort

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:04.039
of statements about Greek let him say everything that he wants about Theology

00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:12.240
and whatnot but remember your expert Neil Neil Neil seriously the

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.760
expert thought there were no vows in

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:24.600
Hebrew okay all right every Israeli just went yeah that's yeah that's what what

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:31.200
is that an American expert holy mackerel holy mackerel Neil here's my question

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.559
and then we're going to go to the next clip should we be standing for

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:43.200
accurate philology accurate history accurate literature or should we give

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.720
things over to people who are experts in the

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.840
Bible I think it should just be class I think it should just be one one giant

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:59.159
field with substudies underneath it and there shouldn't be a separation between

00:19:59.159 --> 00:20:05.880
classicism and biblical studies I think biblical studies should be part of the classicism just like somebody who's a

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:12.840
classicist might have their sub area in Roman Imperial cult literature somebody

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:20.200
you can do that with Bible studies right because this is another thing I noticed I just recently read an expost by a a

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:26.039
scholar by some it was it's it's a scholar that I follow I follow the guy because he's always putting out cool

00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:31.120
stuff on archaeology and thought stuff they find in Pompei and like little im

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:37.960
images of on this day Caesar did this it's pretty cool to follow really good scholar but he made a post he said I

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:47.720
tell my students every year around this time during the first semester number one read Broad and I was like that's it

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.919
read broad if you're you read the more sources you read the better you

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:58.679
understand the context of whatever time period you're trying to study so even if you're just trying to get a PhD in

00:20:58.679 --> 00:21:04.000
medical text I I'll use you for example why not read another why not read about

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.039
the wrestlers of that time period because gayin was treating wrestlers maybe you want to know what they were doing so you you know everything's

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:17.520
connected in the world so it's better to have some broader understanding of certain taxs outside to get a broad

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:24.440
understanding of your own this this brings us back to Plato's ion Plato's ion is one of my favorite

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:31.039
platonic dialogues because in Socrates is talking to this dude ion and he's like you're full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's like

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:37.360
you're not a homer expert he's like whatat do you mean it's all I study I don't study anybody I don't study pendar

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:45.200
I don't study anything but Homer that's all I know is Homer he's like but do you study astronomy do you study this do you

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:50.559
study mathematics do you study geometry do you study geography and he's like why would I need to know all that because

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:56.440
Homer talks about geometry Homer talks about geology Homer talks about this Homer talks about that and I was like yo

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:04.159
is actually kind of this is actually kind of a really good Point Plato's making in this dialogue with the mouth of Socrates read broad it's a big it's a

00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:09.559
that's a number one and that's what I that's one thing I can say that's all I do if I'm not an expert in anything the

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:14.720
only thing I can say I do is try to read broad as broad as I can at least isn't

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:20.279
that isn't that gorgeous five years I'll say this I've been interested in Ancient

00:22:20.279 --> 00:22:25.919
Ancient sources for over a decade I would say

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:32.760
2011 is when I was in prison and I was reading but the Bible cover to cover but it's been about five years now of like

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:37.880
serious trying to learn Greek trying to learn Hebrew trying to trying to you

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:44.600
know look at actual sources and reading critical scholarship it's been about only about five years of that so I'm I'm

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:51.799
I I will admit I'm just getting started at this I still have a long ways to go but yeah but I but I can I have my own

00:22:51.799 --> 00:22:57.000
opinions on things and I'm pretty confident about them but if I'm wrong I'm just going to learn why I'm wrong

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.720
that's why I put myself out there I used to be a mythicist I used to follow the mythicist stuff and I used put myself

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.480
out there I was I was just just as um I was just as uh uh confident about that

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:14.279
as back then as I am about things today and then I started getting getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wrong and I was like I'm done with I

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:20.840
can't prove the guy didn't exist why should I even bother foll so like you know putting yourself out there you'll

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:26.559
either be checked or you'll be correct it's one or the other you got to put yourself out

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:33.919
there put yourself on theed the the arena Arena of ideas right yeah yeah and

00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:40.640
um okay hit we're gonna hit another one hit the next one to Dan right I for standing stones the

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:45.880
masaba delving in ancient Hebrew stuff I I think he's fantastic there have been

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:51.080
critiques I've had right where I'm like damn you're stepping on my toes bro because I have academics that are like

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:56.799
literally pioneering ideas like dionis in the book of Acts the Gospel of John

00:23:56.799 --> 00:24:03.480
like clearly real good reason not like this isn't just you have to stare too hard and then you see similarities there

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:08.840
is really good reason literarily to see that they are imitating Ides bot guy or

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:16.080
other things from dianis and I've wrote him personally said dude love you dude I really wish you would reward this or rework this and come out at least being

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:21.520
more neutral and more balanced because PhD is from Harvard that I

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:29.480
respect okay my question is why is this a concern for Derek what do you think is

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.200
the real issue here that he's asking

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:42.039
about um I for I'm I'm I forgot what he said again um about he said he was conc

00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:49.320
did you just play oh my God run it again chewy give him again I heard play I'm sorry I'm Sor let's play no I love it I

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:56.440
love it it's okay bro have another one have another one go ahead I for standing stones the masaba delving in ancient

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:02.640
Hebrew stuff I I think he's fantastic there have been critiques I've had right where I'm like damn you're stepping on

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:09.559
my toes bro because I have academics that are like literally pioneering ideas like dionis in the book of Acts the

00:25:09.559 --> 00:25:15.039
Gospel of John like clearly real good reason not like this isn't just you have

00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:20.799
to stare too hard and then you see similarities there is really good reason literarily to see that they are

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:26.120
imitating Ides B guy or other things from dianis and I've wrote him personally said dude love you dude I

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:31.520
really wish you would reward this or rework this this and come out at least being more neutral and more balanced

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:37.200
because PhD is from Harvard that I respect my bad I thought you were talking about something he was concerned

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.360
about me I was like I didn't hear him say anything concerned about me you're talking you're talking about Dan yeah

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:48.000
right he's talking about Dan right Derek also has raised concerns about people in

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.520
the comments of his videos and me and dererk have both seen a lot of this people in the comments will say Dan

00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:01.640
mclen has debunk this or Bart Airman has debunked this those are the two common

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:08.200
most common sometimes you'll see them together Bart armman and D mclen have debunk this it's like a bunch of drones

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:13.520
all Bart a dam clown have deun this it's like it's like but they'll never say

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:20.360
what it is that that debunk never go into detail never because me because me and Derek understand that we're touching

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:27.480
topics that aren't mainstream we know that we're not we're not out of the loop on this like we know that this is not

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:33.279
everybody doesn't think this but we're we're we're going into the nuances of some of these subjects that are not

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:38.559
black and white so when people say this is debunked you better come correct and

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:43.640
tell me what it is you're talking about because this is very nuanced exact you have to tell me

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:50.919
exactly what source that I'm looking at is it a fake source that I lie about the source I'm showing you real primary

00:26:50.919 --> 00:26:58.039
sources that's all I'm doing I'm doing most of the stuff I'm doing I'm not even giving it a a a conclusion I'm just

00:26:58.039 --> 00:27:03.559
saying saying here's a source and tell tell me what you think and here's another source oh it sounds a lot like

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:10.559
this Source right here and then that's it that's a lot of times that's my my whole video just be that so yeah and

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:16.600
there's nothing you know there's nothing that you can do when your hand at a source and you hear right out of the

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:22.919
mouth of the person from Antiquity what's going on there's nothing that you can do to stand against that that's

00:27:22.919 --> 00:27:29.760
you're invulnerable that attack position you you cannot defend against that attack position to be even more specific

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:36.360
to be even more I'll give you a specific video there was a guy who did a Tik Tock

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:41.840
directed at Dan mlen it was in a form of a question and he was like Dr Dan mlen

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:47.919
uh do you think it's possible that the Mantic experience of eating the eating

00:27:47.919 --> 00:27:54.840
the blood or flesh of dianis and pruning of the vines has any common or has any

00:27:54.840 --> 00:28:00.000
like ancestral roots to the Eucharist in Christianity which you and I both know

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.480
there's tons of Ruck has written books on this there's tons of papers on this

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:13.600
this has been a subject that's been H hotly debated for centuries and what does Dan do

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:21.720
Dan responds by going to a translation of the baky a random English translation

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.960
from some random guy who used the word semily semily as a Virg said who says

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:32.720
semily is a virgin in this text he doesn't even answer the question he goes

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:38.200
on to say this is a bad translation of the baky and there's no evidence that

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:45.039
Christianity has anything to do with the Eucharist and by the way sem is not a virgin this translation's bad that's the

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:52.240
that was the video where he said samil by the way that's the one where I caught him on that and that video me and dererk were looking at that going what is going

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:59.960
on first of all this is not even what the what he asked second of all there are sources Clem Alexandria even points

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:05.120
out the um how our Eucharist is sacred and divine and their Eucharist is of the

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:11.200
ory so even there even they recognizing that there's something there even if they think there's opposites right but

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:17.399
the point is there could have been a way better response done if it was asked to a better person who's more knowledgeable

00:29:17.399 --> 00:29:22.679
of these things or why even go to the B it's almost as like he thinks the Baka

00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:28.919
is the only dianis text that exist when you ask a question about dianis and your your first thing is let's see what the

00:29:28.919 --> 00:29:35.960
baky says the baky is just one play it's it makes up one% it makes makes up

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:41.519
probably 1% of all the bakic literature that exists yeah yeah that's it so why would you just go to the bak guye and

00:29:41.519 --> 00:29:46.960
then that random English translation at that now remember um he also

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:53.240
said um what was it with Dan what was the thing oh yeah it was the number of

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:59.399
words and all that kind of stuff and you know that's a little disturbing that you don't know know kind of the lexical

00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:04.760
depth of the language that you claim to be able to study right and to be to be

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:11.679
an authority on that's a little bothering as well sounds like you spent a lot of time in the theology probably

00:30:11.679 --> 00:30:17.960
not so much time pounding the linguistic pavement that you know you can tell that even that's I know that's about somebody

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:26.360
else's pool but um you can tell that yeah um okay what about let's go to this

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:32.039
third clip and in this third clip I want to ask you before you watch it look at

00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:39.519
it and tell me what does this have to do with a guy named Almon go ahead let me

00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:44.720
ask you this is more of a personal psychological I question I think it's psychological you notice that you're

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.840
making critiques of Dan or you'll make critiques of some other Scholars that why don't you do that to Almon the way

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:56.279
that you do to them well that's why I brought up the whole like back and forth that I had online being gaslit being

00:30:56.279 --> 00:31:01.960
blocked being told you're wrong treated is different in your view so because

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:07.000
disagree with a lot of Ammon things does he care that you disagree with them Amon yeah no

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.240
okay and by the way you can you can confirm you and I go back and forth when we text we disagree on tons of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:19.240
there's no way that you yeah you can't be a you can't be a

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:25.399
student of any discipline and agree 100% with anybody around you people used to

00:31:25.399 --> 00:31:32.799
try to do that in graduate school like suck up to their advisors it's looked down upon you're supposed to be

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:38.600
challenging each other that's a you know that's a part of the craft you know so

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:44.799
that's the whole point of this whole thing um form your own opinion read the text like I said read Broad and then

00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:51.799
form your own opinion like these the there's a whole bunch of content creators now that are so boring and

00:31:51.799 --> 00:31:59.639
their views reflect it like this channel called history for atheist by this guy Tim O'Neal so so boring you're going to

00:31:59.639 --> 00:32:06.919
fall asleep watching for five minutes all he wants to do is just suck up to the consensus to whatever the consensus

00:32:06.919 --> 00:32:13.279
is you can tell he has zero knowledge of the text he's not reading the sources he's just looking up the consensus and

00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:18.720
then just going that's that's right and I agree with them and it's so lazy it's

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:25.240
so lazy you could just tell I'm the that's one of the worst channels I've ever seen in my entire life the views reflect it too his views no one watches

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:32.440
that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anyways um but I'm just making a point is like you people can see that and go there's nothing of value here

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:39.399
it's a waste of time to even watch this I already know what he's going to say it's all predictable the whole everything he says is so predictable

00:32:39.399 --> 00:32:46.240
there's no Nuance there's no just battling for one side trying to sound smart because you agree with you agree

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:52.360
with the consensus because you're you're act honestly you're not sure of yourself you're scared to to form your own

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:58.399
opinion because you don't have you don't have you don't just don't have what it takes to actually do the work yeah people who have their own own opinions

00:32:58.399 --> 00:33:05.000
on things are people who are very smart and do the work you can notice that yeah yeah best Scholars the best Scholars are

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.639
the ones that you see them disagreeing with a lot of different things in different areas because they actually

00:33:10.639 --> 00:33:17.840
have their own opinions on them because they've actually looked at these things right right exactly because they have

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:23.320
put in the time and the effort and they have worked diligently to guard those

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:28.399
texts they've read them they know them they've they've they've obser absorb

00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:34.000
them yes definitely there's one worry that I have it's one worry I want and

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.120
here's one more thing one more thing I want to say about that they some of these people today act like someone with

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:46.679
a PhD is some anointed priest from some Secret order of of magical Wizards that

00:33:46.679 --> 00:33:52.120
have magical powers to read sources and gain stuff from them that a normal

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:58.039
person cannot see this guy like like like I'll I'll keep talking about Tim O'Neal because I can't stand this guy he

00:33:58.039 --> 00:34:03.880
when he refutes an argument somebody will say something like I think the Dark Ages were actually pretty dark um I

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:10.599
agree with petrarch and makavelli I there is no classical text around this time this is something I would say the te the text what do you have oh let's

00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:17.440
see Beowolf that's it and and Church Father text uh so that's a pretty dark time to

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:23.760
me where nobody was in the theater nobody's nobody's doing anything besides church stuff that's a dark age to me and

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:29.280
that's a subjective thing to say he'll be like uh

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:34.638
Dan mclen says that the Dark Ages weren't that dark so you're wrong you're

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:40.480
wrong because this one PhD said so uh and that's that's how he that's

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:47.320
how he reacts to everything he just finds the one scholar that he wants that agrees with goes but this guy says that

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:53.000
you're wrong I'm not even going to get into the nuances and why you're wrong I'm just going to site this one guy and

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.599
just go with it it's so lazy and boring it's like shut your channel down doing nothing you're wasting your own time go

00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:07.040
go do something waste spend your time with better [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude nobody's gaining anything from your channel it's part of

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:14.560
a bigger game too and this is what I am afraid of and this is what I sense I

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:19.760
know it it's gonna feel like you're Anakin somewhere between Yoda and the

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.200
emperor but I am reading a sense of

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:32.880
something that Derek s the frontier or what was it chewy what

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:38.359
was it oh that's what it was pioneering

00:35:38.359 --> 00:35:43.880
ideas so he said the people at Harvard right and everybody's supposed to go oh

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:51.240
Harvard oh no right I stood outside of Harvard and

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:59.119
I'm gonna say this and this may this this is a harsh thing to say this is one of those harsh things that Derek doesn't

00:35:59.119 --> 00:36:06.839
want his people doing I stood outside of Harvard University with Professor Carl

00:36:06.839 --> 00:36:12.680
Rock and he told me of the work that I was doing it was better than anything

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:18.920
that's come out of Harvard in years in

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.599
years do you know what happens when you let your religion programs take over you

00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:29.839
do like Princeton and you drop your Greek program cuz your wusses can't

00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:38.359
handle it so they want to hear what do they want to hear they want to hear pioneering ideas and that's how you sell

00:36:38.359 --> 00:36:47.599
those little Rich bastards their tuition oh God oh God it's

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:53.760
disgusting it's disgusting and Neil that's what I'm afraid of I'm afraid of

00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:02.560
the merchandising the devil was like oh my God what a den what a den of brothy you

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:08.599
know what it smells like I smell right now the smell I walked into a dormatory

00:37:08.599 --> 00:37:15.119
in a seminary on the day after the opening

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:21.000
performance of media with a chorus of Furies that let me tell you something

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:28.440
Aphrodite was proud of these Furies these Catholic college girls they

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:34.359
put everything out there and I walked through that dormatory room and I said

00:37:34.359 --> 00:37:40.359
this is what it's like this is what it's like I understand what the Romans were

00:37:40.359 --> 00:37:47.200
saying and their poets when they talked about that very distinctive smell of the

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:54.319
bravel and I realized the power of the aolon oh it's good was such a oh my God

00:37:54.319 --> 00:37:59.800
why are we going back in time let's go forward um I want to I'm GNA show that

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:06.599
last clip one more time I want to say something though yeah go ahead the merchandising of academ Academia tuition

00:38:06.599 --> 00:38:11.920
is going up and up and up and up and up and now it's just become this joke of

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:18.599
whoever is the most privileged person can who can afford to go out of high school and not have to work and their

00:38:18.599 --> 00:38:24.079
parents can get them into college and they can be most people aren't even

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:29.240
thinking about being a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scholar of of ancient text they're thinking of

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:35.280
like what job will make me the most money like I'm G to be like an engineer or like a doctor or something so the

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:43.599
people that are going into ancient studies now are the most privileged [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] douches in the world sorry so

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:49.240
that's why it's that's why it's trash now I think compared to the century before I'm just saying you could see it

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:54.480
you could see it there are a bunch of privileged little dorks you can just

00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:01.800
tell with spoons up their asses yes up their asses because no one else

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:08.960
is is in any position to become a scholar anymore because of the way Academia is it's dead you're better off

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.800
just going learning Greek from a tutor learning Latin from a tutor getting some Hebrew from whatever whatever language

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:20.400
you need to study and then start reading texts on your own start reading articles on your own just start publishing your

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:26.880
own articles just try to get in somehow yeah and then just do it that way just do it do it the way [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Russell

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:33.599
gurkin did it like who cares about a PhD I think that's how that's what I'm starting to think you know

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:40.920
anybody don't need it anybody who's motivated can anybody who's motivated

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:46.160
can take that step and can immerse themselves in the language and can push

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:51.520
and push and push in this day and age more than anything yeah the ones that

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:58.640
persist man and Neil listen you have the entire lobe series and you've got

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:06.240
access I have a better library at my possession than most people did before the 19th century in world history right

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:12.000
right now I me Neil sunle have a better Library yeah in my possession than

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:19.160
almost every human being that's ever lived before the 19th century 20th maybe 20th century seriously so what the hell

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:26.800
like what do you think people went to school for to become scholars in ancient history to read text to learn the text

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:34.560
and inform an opinion on them yeah that's it okay flash up the Christ Neil take a

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:42.400
look at this word take a look at this word I want to um tell you past present and future go ahead um people are

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:52.319
starting to learn now that this is a drug term and they're starting to learn it uid says a Christ is a um is a drug

00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:59.920
that's used to induce arousal sexual arousal right so um where can the Bible

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:07.520
studies people run to to get away from this because nobody nobody will talk or

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:13.960
debate with almond and I think it's from that last clip I think there's there's some kind of radiation in that last clip

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:20.800
show that last clip one more time what about inspiring philosophy yeah hang on hang on show me show me that last clip

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:26.280
let me ask this is more of a personal psychological I question I think it's psychological you notice that you're

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:31.480
making critiques of or you'll make critiques of some other Scholars that why don't you do that to Almon the way

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:37.880
that you do to them well that's why I brought up the whole like back and forth that I had online being gaslit being

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:44.640
blocked being told being told you're wrong treated byone is different in your view so I disagree with a lot of ammon's

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:50.440
things does he care that you disagree with them Amon yeah no okay yeah do do I

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:57.000
treat you differently buddy by the way no offense to Derek but if the way he

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.560
the way that question didn't make sense to me because it's like why don't I critique every single person I disagree

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:08.200
with I don't that would be like all right I'm just I'm disagreeing with Dan I make a video about Dan right all right

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:14.640
I've made some videos on I did Richard carrier I did Ralph Ellis I think that might be it I don't I don't usually talk

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:20.920
about other people who I disag every single day that goes by I hear something from somebody and I think I don't really

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:26.680
agree with that and I don't even comment I don't even care I'll treat most people that way because it's just like their

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:33.040
opinion it's not that big of a deal so it's like I don't know why he only pointed to you cuz like that could just

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:40.880
be about anybody but I guess what he's saying I guess what he what he meant by that was like um me being around you and

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:46.440
on your show and hearing things I disagree with why don't I budge in and but that like like I said I if that was

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:53.440
the case then I would have to do it to every single person and I would just be I would just be an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I would don't want to be an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I've chose and

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:59.559
I and I explained why why I did the video on Dan the way I got treated the gaslighting that happened when I

00:42:59.559 --> 00:43:05.280
when I tried to engage with him on on X the one time um so I made a video that's

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:11.680
that's just the honest truth that's why I did the video there there's there's dozens of people online who I could make

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.839
even worse videos about easily and I don't I just don't it's not that big of

00:43:16.839 --> 00:43:22.720
a deal it could also be that you don't do that because you

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:30.800
work with the sources and you know that all I'm doing is giving sources and so these people

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:37.800
who sit around they make beliefs and they write beliefs into books and they come up with ideas and they sell you

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:45.160
them in the form of books or baseball camps or if you notice Derek was wearing a t-shirt with his own image on it right

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:50.599
they're selling you something you know Neil that that is not

00:43:50.599 --> 00:43:59.760
a part of the art and you preserve those sources and I think there is an element

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:06.079
in that that opposes the whole prophit

00:44:06.079 --> 00:44:13.680
driven business that is the manipulation of what you are told is history and that's

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:19.480
what we're right in the midst of seeing I think that bothers them about almond I

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:24.960
think it bothers them I respect look just to from my own opinion from my own

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:32.760
perspective I respect what you do with the text and you made

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:39.400
another human being appear to be 100% completely and

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:45.200
totally utterly purposefully fraking wrong right you know how many words

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:54.599
there are in Hebrew 79,90 what the f seriously if I did that

00:44:54.599 --> 00:45:02.280
in a meeting in any of my science uh work oh my God they would

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:08.640
have kicked me out of there and said what are you doing doing molecular biology I think well I almost I almost

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:16.440
think that the the because people said that I should have let that go because he made a statement the statement to me

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:23.760
was the worst was the worst part about it because the statement wasn't I'm wrong you talk I I was I got caught off

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:30.440
guard I was wrong the statement was I knew that I was wrong but I leaned into it because I got the decimal wrong you

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:35.800
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] liar sorry that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I I think I think the

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:42.760
statement made it worse so just being that's I'm just being yeah

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:47.839
right sorry I'm I'm gonna censor you with my own beeping you're not monetized

00:45:47.839 --> 00:45:54.480
anyway but you're right I shouldn't do that okay so here's Christos I just want to flash some words up here here's the

00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:01.240
past present and future and this is for satanic congregation and Neil you're free to just jump in whenever you want

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:07.640
but they're nailed people we have them nailed on this word Christos they cannot

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:14.559
reclaim it it's ours we possess it it's a drug it's a yeah no it's a drug a

00:46:14.559 --> 00:46:23.800
Christ is a drug that is used to induce horniness and ultimately the death and

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:30.240
Resurrection okay let me say that one more time is a drug that is used through the

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:37.240
Avenue of horniness to induce death and Resurrection okay thank you Hil Satan

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:44.800
Aphrodite right love it let me ask you this what about the oyst yeah how's that connected yeah how is that what do you

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:52.520
yeah yeah you know where the oysters comes from it comes from that EOS right it comes from when you talk

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:59.040
about IO you were talking about that drug that induces that sexual frenzy I'm

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:04.680
not the one who said it the Greeks are yeah oyster people how do you get

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:10.720
into that why do you think they're all saying the oracles are making love to Apollo why do you think there's that

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:16.400
whole sexual dimension in there right it's baked into the drugs the that was

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:21.680
number one we've got them the reason the reason why I brought that up is because in

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:28.000
prometheus's um one of the trilogies might be Prometheus

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:38.280
but I think I'm like 90% sure it's prus bound it's one of the trilogy ones yo is a Christa and she's christed

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:44.599
by a gadfly it uses the word Christ in that in that form at chist I think it's

00:47:44.599 --> 00:47:51.839
e Christy I think or I don't know I gu I have to look it up but it's it's got that form right but it also has this

00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:57.800
she's being it uses that for stung she's stung by a gadfly and then then I've

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:03.760
recently Apollo Doris when he tells the story about yo he also mentions it again

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:10.119
that yo is the one who was sent by Hera from or S Hera sent the gadfly to sting

00:48:10.119 --> 00:48:16.359
yo the cow so like something's up there is some weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on with yo and the gadflies and Chris

00:48:16.359 --> 00:48:22.000
thing exactly yeah and all and as you pointed out all of that connected with

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:29.559
media right who is we have the earliest recorded Christ from and um I challenge

00:48:29.559 --> 00:48:35.640
you there's a lot of Greek literature you've seen the entire loes right now there's a lot and the loes aren't

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:43.440
everything there's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton I can give you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of of medical sources right now that um nobody's translated

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:50.880
right that talk about oh God what do you do when you want to get erection for two days right okay well you got to prepare

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:57.440
how do you prepare right they have all of it it's gorgeous stuff gorgeous so

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:02.480
okay cool way what about this word most people don't know that in the

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:08.119
PGM there's a fragment in the PGM that says there's like some magical phrase

00:49:08.119 --> 00:49:13.720
you got to say but before you say the words you have to take a naked boy into

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:22.160
a graveyard it's in the PGM so like there is something there and

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:27.319
and and by the way you're not the first person to point this out Morton Smith no was the first person well I don't know

00:49:27.319 --> 00:49:36.079
if he's the first person he's just another guy who thought that the the mark 14 uh or is it 14 yeah Mark 14 had

00:49:36.079 --> 00:49:41.559
some weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on he thought there was some weird PGM style [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going so you're not in a league of your

00:49:41.559 --> 00:49:49.079
own by the way and that's something you should point out more often I think yeah I know you don't care but like I think some people should know that yeah no no

00:49:49.079 --> 00:49:56.000
yeah I try I don't want people thinking that I made anything up I just I steal everything right I steal everything from

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:03.240
these ancient ources right do you think I'm smart enough to figure out the Hebrew thing no I had to be led through

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:11.440
Africanus he was the smart linguist who figured it out but anyway okay give me lce St here's another Point Neil where

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:17.319
um the Evangelical the biblical Community the theology Community they're

00:50:17.319 --> 00:50:23.720
not going to be able to talk their way out of the LA stas and it's only because they've had no access to those authors

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:28.760
like Lucian right and I know oh God he's a Biblical expert right but he doesn't

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:34.000
know who Lucian is and he doesn't know there are terms that Lucian is using and

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.720
by the way this one I thought was best this one I thought was best and just for the sake of truth please let's get this

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:48.640
out there just for the sake of Truth Dan said there is no christing in the New

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:54.920
Testament this is not a drug that you put in the eyes to alter your vision

00:50:54.920 --> 00:51:00.680
right this is not that at all and he said it with such confidence just shook

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:06.000
his head right when he was doing that I was watching the interview and when he

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:12.720
was doing that I said yeah yeah what how is he able to get away with that because

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:17.799
you don't know that it says in the book of the apocalypse which is in the Fring

00:51:17.799 --> 00:51:24.920
Bible it's canonical John's apocalypse what does he say he said God wants you

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:33.319
to Christ your eyes that you may see yeah so um he didn't even know his

00:51:33.319 --> 00:51:38.799
own text anybody who has read the the

00:51:38.799 --> 00:51:45.760
Apocalypse in Greek and I've read it forwards and backwards I much prefer reading it backwards it's way better is

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:52.400
it but I've read it forwards and backwards and I can tell you for a fact multiple times now

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:59.119
multiple yeah I can tell you for a fact anybody who reads Greek like Dan

00:51:59.119 --> 00:52:05.119
pretends to anybody who does that would have picked that up that in Christ thing

00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:13.079
is right there it's in your own text how do you not see your own Works Dan is

00:52:13.079 --> 00:52:20.319
fraudulent and you were pointing it out and that Neil is the good side of the

00:52:20.319 --> 00:52:27.240
force that's the good side of the force don't get pulled do you want to know when I knew I was going to make a video

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:34.280
yeah when I heard the the sa Theo saase come up and I saw when he said the idea

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:40.839
that this word predates the Hebrew is just completely nonsense and I just go I just remember

00:52:40.839 --> 00:52:46.280
thinking wow this is insane like this is

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:51.760
this this guy's never hasn't touched any classical sources at all because that

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:57.359
word is abundant that word remember I gave a bunch of examples I could have kept going it would been boring but I

00:52:57.359 --> 00:53:03.799
could have kept going that word is so abundant in ancient text way before the

00:53:03.799 --> 00:53:11.559
Hebrew Bible shows up in any of the Greek sources they're using that word for reverence awe and you know sacred

00:53:11.559 --> 00:53:17.280
all that type of stuff for the exactly how you kind of described it when you were talking um the person that wrote an

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:24.240
article about you Christy Hansen wrote an article about you Christy Hance is mad at me now great don't care don't

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:30.640
give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] by the way um mad at now because uh because of my Dan video um

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:36.079
Chrissy's article said that was that about you saying that job was called

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:42.480
Theos seas because job get this this is Christy doesn't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] either job was

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:48.480
called Theos Bas because job was not Jewish that's why so so so Chrissy must

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:56.520
have saw my video and said holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is directed at me too cuz I didn't know Theos base was this common word in

00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:01.839
all religious and us it all different religious terminologies and uh for any

00:54:01.839 --> 00:54:07.000
God at all it doesn't matter if it's Jewish god or whatever God does it have to be godfear of you know what I'm

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:12.400
saying like job whoever wrote job uh when it's when they're using the

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:20.040
term Theos seas in the Greek doesn't matter what the translation came first it doesn't even matter that's the whole thing Theos Seas means Pious even in

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:25.240
that context they didn't call job that because he wasn't Jewish get it like so

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:33.400
so Chrissy was probably mad seeing like damn he got me too you know what I mean so sorry get mad all you want yeah and

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:40.200
there's no reason there's no reason you should apologize I felt this I felt this

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:48.119
this hit me the most from the interview that you had with Derek it's almost as if he was trying to smooth things over

00:54:48.119 --> 00:54:55.119
and to say look you know you showed somebody for being a fraud but you know he's also a Biblical expert so let's all

00:54:55.119 --> 00:55:01.599
play Happy um Neil I just want to tell you uh um as

00:55:01.599 --> 00:55:09.720
a member of the satanic congregation you don't have to please anyone we follow

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:16.000
reason and when people project and create Lies when people give you false

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:23.079
history when people do so under the pretending to have the authority of these texts that we know that they don't

00:55:23.079 --> 00:55:28.160
they don't actually don't actually use these tools um I think it's our right

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:35.119
and our duty to confront them and say as the furies would say you greed says your

00:55:35.119 --> 00:55:44.160
soul was a stance of Ruin yeah yeah I love it I thought you did an excellent job I congratulate you sir and I say

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:50.799
good luck in um spreading that message um continually

00:55:50.799 --> 00:55:58.319
through your channel because that's your art and I love it and screw them you know what I mean if they if they don't

00:55:58.319 --> 00:56:03.839
if they are afraid I'm going to keep I'm Danny Jones is going to keep setting me

00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:10.280
up okay he's gonna find we got one that said he would do it and's I don't want I

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:16.200
don't want somebody who just will do it there's plenty of people who write to me all the time and say oh I'm this and

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:22.760
that I'll go Toe to Toe with you that's not what I'm looking for that's not know who inspiring philosophy is though you

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:29.680
know who IP is though right no I don't actually I'm talked about on this channel remember last time I was on this

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:36.319
channel we were talking about the Beloved remember and those two Christians were crying because you were making fun of Jesus and they were like

00:56:36.319 --> 00:56:43.920
Jesus was sinless he would never do anything sexual and you came on and you were like I know that it's hard to

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:50.680
understand that your savior was with a naked kid in a park at 400

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:56.559
a.m. I was in that CH I was in that video that's he he said he would do it

00:56:56.559 --> 00:57:03.079
yeah yeah I'm that would be the battle of the century you have to do it I need

00:57:03.079 --> 00:57:09.599
people to see ultimately this is what I need people to see I need them to see

00:57:09.599 --> 00:57:16.240
the person who is under the control of the monest theology I need to

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:23.480
see them turned deconverted completely anti christed and

00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:29.720
um that's what I'm looking for and uh Iron Iron Maiden Danny Jones will bring

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:35.440
it I know that he will so um that's where that's my future Neil tell us what

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:41.640
you're working on documentary wise I have a video right now that I'm should

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:47.039
be out sooner than not I know I've been uh I had the moving thing going on so

00:57:47.039 --> 00:57:52.760
it's been a while but this video is halfway done about halfway done scripts

00:57:52.760 --> 00:58:00.520
done scripts mostly done um and uh it's about original sin so what do you mean

00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:06.440
by come on what is that some sort of theology [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Well turns out the oric in

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:14.760
the oric theogony when dionis was eaten by the Titans Zeus was so angry that he caused

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:19.839
the Deluge of to wipe out all of the cosmos wasn't even just the Earth it was

00:58:19.839 --> 00:58:25.039
the whole Cosmos most people miss that and then the world starts over right but

00:58:25.039 --> 00:58:30.520
because so when when when humans are created after that they have half

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:37.680
Titanic nature and half bakic nature which makes them spirit and flesh the

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:45.039
spirit comes from bakus the flesh comes from the Titans because they consumed the fruit of bakus bakus is a

00:58:45.039 --> 00:58:50.559
fruit God they consume the fruit of bakus just like and then I so I have a

00:58:50.559 --> 00:58:56.160
chapter on that I have a chapter on Pandora Pandora in the Box Prometheus

00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:06.160
comes in and warns her like like the serpent does in works and days uh theogony I have Ewa and uh pany being

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:12.720
called the Ewa a Corey she eats the pom and granite she gets stuck in Hades it's

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:18.280
an opposite of what happens to Eve when she bites the Fruit by the way most it's

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:25.640
most likely a pom granate that Eve bit from not a not an Apple so it was the same fruit and she gets cast out of

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:32.359
paradise right so you have we have um we have all I'm comparing all those

00:59:32.359 --> 00:59:40.359
texts together and showing the orphic origins of it all God that sounds fantastic it sounds

00:59:40.359 --> 00:59:49.319
like good work you know um one of these days somebody's gonna have to Grant you some kind of um uh unofficial degree so

00:59:49.319 --> 00:59:55.440
uh if you keep writing and putting together I'm gonna have to make something up I'm gonna have to make up

00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:00.559

so this is the actual history of your monest belief Give me the give me the

01:00:57.359 --> 01:01:04.200

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:47.240
want you to remember the past isn't what

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:53.079
you've been fed and there is a way out and it's not through me and it's not

01:02:53.079 --> 01:03:00.119
through Neil it's through those texts that is

01:03:00.119 --> 01:03:06.319
our reality that is our reflection and um

01:03:06.319 --> 01:03:11.359
this is what we need to do we're not doing this for money right we can't do

01:03:11.359 --> 01:03:17.200
this for money The Joy that's in Neil that possession that he gets when he's

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:22.480
working through those sources that's dope that is

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:28.039
dope and if you are sitting on an organiz ation that's made of people who

01:03:28.039 --> 01:03:33.599
are selling modules of their speech and

01:03:33.599 --> 01:03:41.200
yet they are wrong where is that going to end

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:48.000

evening I couldn't agree more we live in a time period I say this a lot in your

01:04:07.279 --> 01:04:14.160
