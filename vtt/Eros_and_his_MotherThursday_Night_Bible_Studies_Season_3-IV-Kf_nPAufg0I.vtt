he's making after that we'll talk about plenty bring him back from the dead

so I'll also have a little appearance tomorrow night on Gnostic informant

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.360
we'll be talking about drugs talking about the drugs of antiquity a topic

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:05.399
that nobody ever ever wants to talk about classicists included classicists

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.560
included it's getting a little bit better a professor from Brown told me it'll

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:19.020
take people 10 years to catch up and then once they do it'll take off well it's been about 12 years now so we ought

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.020
to be making some progress in the field of ancient drugs try going

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:33.000
fun try going to your preacher Pastor Minister priest

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.060
try going to one of those people and asking them what do you know about drugs

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.420
when they tell you they don't know anything if they're honest if they uh you can just say okay thanks for being

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.640
honest but when they try to be bring up the topic of a goat ignore them run run

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.959
you're in the wrong place you're in the that's the that's the only back alley they can find to catch you and is that

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.840
goat that go to sacrifice it has nothing to do with anything anything

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.720
especially not the language they love to dance around those silly

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.980
pulls all the time it's hilarious let's get let's get on with a couple of Clips tonight of

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.280
myth vision Derek is hit a couple of points this week that I

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.560
was just like hey kudos to this man kudos to him and what

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.659
he is doing there's an honor a real honor in this he

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.819
has really captured the satanic spirit

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.599
yeah he's on fire with it Chewie hit us he just saying we're at a battle here in

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:58.319
terms of ideologies which affect all sorts of other things from politics ethics you name it

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.260
do you want to see the world become a better place I do

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.620
and I am in no way saying we need to shut down all religion or people should not be allowed to practice them

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.799
fundamentalism is an absolute opposition in my opinion to being able to freely

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.639
think fundamentalism notice that he said fundamentalism not one type of

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:32.100
fundamentalism but fundamentalism in general is an enemy is the old thought box

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.220
yeah hence the old argument why are you worshiping nature you don't

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:45.600
need that nature stuff we've got Creed yeah that's what the that's what Mr

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.820
Lambert in all of his you know he's having all of his guests on and he's got

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.160
experts he's got access to them and you can see he's growing you see the same

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.759
thing in Gnostic informant they're outgrowing they're tutors yeah they're outgrowing their tutors

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:09.660
they're essentially getting an education and they're outgrowing their tutors and they're seeing this is a war

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.479
this is a war yeah beautiful let's roll that second clip because Christians don't do that

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.699
when they're doing the claims for other deities they don't believe those things are all true

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:27.300
but theirs they do Muslims are doing the same thing with their particular worldview they have their own spin

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.340
not interested so help us with this battle this war by

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.440
liking the videos of the content creators you like by sharing the content out there as far

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.740
and as wide as you can leaving a comment goes a very far distance in helping the

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.979
algorithm pay attention even if it is just a comment here's one for the algorithm

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:57.120
because we have such large Christian apologetic channels that get all this attention and there's there's really an

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:04.500
ideological war going on to speed up the process and make this material more Broad and more public

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:11.280
that's how you can help there is an ideological war

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.160
going on he's talking about YouTube

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.759
yeah yeah this is a man who has worked the front line and seized the front line

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:29.039
for what it is yeah do you see the energy in him the

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:36.240
Zeal this smacks of the ancient Museum I can

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:44.100
I can smell it I can smell the ancient Museum no matter what you fundamentalists do no matter what you

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:50.840
indoctrinated dogmatic orthodoxic hegemonic Theocratic people do

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.180
the museum will persist you can burn all of our

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:03.979
Scrolls you can take all the books out of circulation you will not stop reason

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:11.160
you won't stop us this is beautiful um Kudos Derek Lambert Miss vision

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:19.380
yeah he's right there with war this is field of Mars right oh oh love it love it love it love

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.660
it okay let's go tonight to our first little bit of uh jaunt back into the

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:33.120
history we're gonna be doing Bible study tonight I'm going to take you to the proto-evangelion the infancy Gospel of

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.520
James we're going to look at a section that makes no sense in the English

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.860
that's because the translation is terrible but first we're going to start

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.560
with some plenty and you'll notice I'm giving you all of Plenty in English

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.080
yeah yeah think about that there's a good reason

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.860
um the Latin comes across much more clearly you can refine it with technical

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:08.099
adjustments but as my students who are learning both languages now as they're going to see is they're going to start

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:14.160
to develop different forms of communication there's different levels of thinking and with

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:22.139
the ancient Greek sometimes we can get so lost in the orphic analog that we

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:27.300
lose sight of what's going on that's right tonight's text is full it's full

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.820
of orific radiation you're gonna love it first we gotta go through a little background with plenty hit that first

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:38.880
plenty yeah I should have been inclined to think

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:44.700
that Orpheus had been the first to introduce into a Country Stone in Arizona Certain Magical superstitions

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.860
based upon the practice of medicine right off the bat right off the bat we

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:55.320
have an association with medicine and Magic plenty Just Hits this over and

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:04.200
over and over and over again you have to realize you cannot separate the drugs

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:11.100
and the magic you can't when he says Madison those things that are given

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:17.279
Medea to make puts you in a state of Wellness yes he's talking about drugs he's

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:22.620
talking about Pharmacy right sorcery it's why we call it you know all the

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:28.200
Fatima Khan Roots we translate sorcery sorcery right

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:34.200
drugs and Magic are one let's go to the next quote

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.660
for the art of magic is a fact beyond all doubt though at the same time I

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:45.600
would have marked that in the most ancient times and when plenty says ancient times he's talking about Bronze

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.839
Age he's talking about his Antiquity right and indeed by the way his first

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:57.660
century um and indeed almost invariably it was in this branch of science that was

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.820
sought the highest point of celebrity and of literary Renown at all events

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:10.380
Pythagoras we find we find in pedicles Democritus and Plato cross the seas in

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:16.320
order to attain a knowledge thereof and you say to yourself Democritus what a

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:23.760
Democritus give us he's that pre-syncratic philosopher who gave us the atom

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:30.720
yeah your concept everything that modern physics is based on that's a conception

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:36.019
in from the mind of a pre-socratic philosopher who

00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:44.279
studied and wrote about magic extensively extensively good good let's get another

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:52.260
quote from Plenty it was Democritus too first your attention to Apollo Becky's of comptos

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:58.440
to dardanus and to Phoenix The Works of dardenness and yes that's

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:06.899
the famous dardeness who we call the Greeks after right we call them dardanians yes that's him he saw it in

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:12.480
the Tomb of uh of that personage right you always bury your magic scrolls with

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.240
you Noom is doing it right for a reason and his own were composed in accordance

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.899
with the doctrines there found give me one more give me one more text

00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:31.100
there is also a marvelous coincidence in the fact that the two Arts medicine I mean magic we're developed

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:36.360
simultaneously Medicine by the writings of Hippocrates and Magic by The Works of

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:43.860
Democritus so right away they should throw you a little bit wait a minute the origins of that Greek literary magic

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:51.420
where we have books that contain these magical principles and premises and

00:11:51.420 --> 00:12:00.000
spells and incantations and hymns that all of these things literally go

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.100
back to a pre-socratic wave of Renaissance like thought yes they do

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:15.060
they do but we'll see that the earlier forms of this that come

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:23.959
uh from this Persian magus the these medo-persian mogress

00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:30.899
these forms are ultimately where plenty is going to say all of this interaction

00:12:30.899 --> 00:12:37.680
took place with the drugs all of this knowledge plenty tells us

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.839
about the Magi using drugs to interrogate

00:12:42.839 --> 00:12:49.560
and he says they're wonderful drugs for causing you to hallucinate for you to be able to see things that

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:56.579
are horrific that are incredibly scary and all the Magus has to do who's

00:12:56.579 --> 00:13:01.920
performing the interrogation is to give you the drug and then for himself to take in the

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:10.740
demon the diamond and to express that diamond to this drugged person and that person will tell

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:17.700
you the truth as they perceive it they will reflect what exactly they

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:24.360
perceive it's amazing it's amazing technology so plenty tells us that the Magi do this

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:30.300
they're the best interrogators and they work against conspiracies right you want to find out who the other conspirators

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:35.880
are drug the guy that you catch and get their names and locations

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:44.100
so what does that have to do with the Bible study what does that have to do with the Bible study of course the

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:52.139
evangelicals are not going to know this the guys at the Seminary who claim to be Greek experts are not going to know this

00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:58.440
why because the only thing they ever read was their own little texts

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:06.019
and when you do that you don't develop a vocabulary you develop an inbred

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:11.279
two-headed three-eyed monster it's disgusting

00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:16.800
it's disgusting don't tell me you can translate those texts you can't

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:25.139
I'll take any of you on yeah breathe heavy heavy breathing

00:14:25.139 --> 00:14:31.200
oh I'm sorry it gets me gassed though when that happens what does this have to do with the Bible right Devil's only

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:39.120
give me another quarter of an hour so what does this have to do with the Bible let's run to the text now

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:45.540
um chewy get us quick to the star system that has the next set of quotes in it

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:53.760
yeah here we go perfect nice look at this here we are in the sixth month of her pregnancy that's Mary Mary I told

00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:00.300
you this had something to do with the Bible Joseph came from his house building and went into the house to find

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:05.339
her swelling uh-oh and he struck his face

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:11.459
and threw himself on the ground and sackcloth and wept bitterly how can I

00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:18.720
look to the Lord God what will I pray about her for I took her as a virgin from the Temple of the Lord and did not

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:25.079
guard her who has set this trap for me who did this evil in my house

00:15:25.079 --> 00:15:31.560
I want to come back to this but I want to stop there and just comments on it you see what's happening he's saying who

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:36.779
came in and raped my Virgin somebody came in and raped my version

00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:42.180
who's I'm in trouble now I'm supposed to be guarding this virgin [Music] and

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.880
she's pregnant who did this

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:53.279
who stole this version for me and defiled her has not the story of Adam

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:58.740
been repeated with me for while Adam was glorifying God the serpent came and

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:05.100
found Eve alone and deceives her and defiled her so it's happened to me do

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:11.940
you hear what he just says is over here he just said he's saying that Eve

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:20.339
was entered into sexual intercourse with you know who serpent himself

00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:29.060
right everybody knows he's the hottest right you didn't know that all of Genesis came down to one fact that Eve

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:35.880
saw the hotter of the two choices and ended up having intercourse now this

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:41.699
doesn't strike me as odd it does a lot of people that Eve would be having sex

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:47.279
with the devil right um but we know that the devil used to

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:53.279
scrape his skin put it in her water

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:58.699
yeah Isn't that cool now if you were covered in pain

00:16:58.699 --> 00:17:07.020
and psychedelic paint and you were going to influence someone

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:13.199
to try to bring that sting of Eros to them right that's why we have Eros in the

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:21.240
front today if you're going to try to bring that sting to them you can do it with a drug you can do it

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:28.438
this and that that's aspers gorgeous gorgeous right that evening star we all

00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:34.260
know what do people say hey Neil and Derek you guys have a lot of shows with

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:39.419
experts on I talk a lot about the devil not once have I heard any of these

00:17:39.419 --> 00:17:47.280
people talk about how hot the devil was devil was the best looking of everybody

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:55.860
this is Adonis for a reason you see it do you see the Morning Star

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:02.160
now I'm giving you the images that those of you who have ears to hear will be

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:08.280
able to know exactly where we are okay let's go nice quote we gotta we

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.760
gotta hustle through this and the high priest said to her Mary what is this how have you humiliated yourself did you

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:21.059
forget the Lord You're God you were raised in the holy of holies and received from the hand of an Angel wait

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:26.280
what yeah I looked at the Greek it's very the

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:32.160
same thing it's it's literally you're nourished you were grown you were grown

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:39.299
in the holy of holies not just the temple he doesn't say the temple in what the Greeks called the ataton the Inner

00:18:39.299 --> 00:18:44.880
Space where you met with the god that's where she was raised

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:50.280
that's where she was raised she made the purple and the Scarlet dies for the

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:58.799

danced before what you heard their songs and danced before them oh

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:12.299
maybe that's why he's talking about the dancing in the chorus for the temple

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:20.400
oh it's beautiful look at the Jews performing these rights the rights of a pagan mystery you would think

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:26.580
you would think their history would have stopped them but it didn't

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:32.700
didn't that's how we get to this quirky this quirky saying that nobody can explain it

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:39.539
the English translations are terrible keep going to the next uh what's their next is it yep here we go okay so what's

00:19:39.539 --> 00:19:45.419
gonna happen right The High Priestess found out The High Priestess found out that Mary's

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:51.860
pregnant and he summoned Josephine and Mary right

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:57.020
and so the priests the high priest says

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:05.400
give me back my girl give me back the Virgin notice he's

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:11.400
still calling her a virgin right yeah the Virgin whom you took from

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.919
the Temple of the Lord and so I'm reading this literally and so

00:20:16.919 --> 00:20:22.320
Joseph stood there and started crying

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:29.100
I'm sorry it says that he started crying okay okay uh so you know probably

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:35.480
because he's scared right he defiled the virgin of the temple my God man that can't be good

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:43.760
and so the the pie priest says to him I am going to make you drink

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:51.660
the water of the Judgment of the Lord and it will

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:56.700
make clear your wrongdoings in your eyes

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:03.059
take that off for a minute it will make clear your wrongdoings in

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:08.160
your eyes now in a minute he's going to untie him both

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:14.760
all right if you read this in English it makes no sense it makes absolutely no sense because and

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:20.760
this is where we on satanic initiation will benefit

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:29.220
so much what they do is they follow the actual analog they follow the metaphor

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:35.220
right and they say Joseph goes off from the Wilderness he comes back and everything's fine

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:40.980
they're following the analog right listen to it with your ears it's a

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:47.280
drug interrogation okay so he's gonna give you and that thing that he says he's going to give

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.880
him is a title for a drug

00:21:54.659 --> 00:22:04.799
Judgment of God yes you know what the Judgment of God is it's a drug the love of God the love of

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:12.860
God let me say that again the love of God is the name of an ancient drug

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:20.000
do you know what it's made of it's Jesus's semen

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.720
yeah yeah bring those texts I am

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:33.179
bring those tags yeah let's go back to the Greek finish

00:22:33.179 --> 00:22:39.600
this up and uh the the high priest took him and forced him to drink and when it says it

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:47.220
took him that's really like capturing him like like taking a hold of putting hands on him and he forces him

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.440
to drink he forces him to drink or does he force

00:22:52.440 --> 00:23:00.059
him uh to he forces him to drink what he told him he's gonna force him to drink pimpson and he sent him out into the

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:06.299
wilderness he sent him out into the Wilderness where's what's the Wilderness the

00:23:06.299 --> 00:23:14.640
Wilderness is that place where you are tempted it is literally here this use of it of

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:20.039
the word is that Borderland in Egypt they referred to it this way it's that

00:23:20.039 --> 00:23:26.280
desert Borderland um in Greece different parts of Grace you could talk about the

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.780
inlands of the Hills the wild Hill Country as that Wilderness

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:39.200
as that Wilderness yes um let's go devil says six minutes

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:45.179
uh and so yeah and so what else did he do any Kai Elfin right so he can't he

00:23:45.179 --> 00:23:52.799
comes back and he's Hollow cleros he's Hollow clairos that word cleros is the

00:23:52.799 --> 00:24:00.600
word for lot yes his lot is whole he comes back he

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:06.240
hasn't untied him yet right he hasn't let him go he sends him into the Wilderness with

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:12.080
this solution that he makes him drank specifically drank and he comes back

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:19.380
holocaatos true to the sorte true to the

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:25.799
um the randomization of reality this is this is drug talk these are necromancers

00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:33.419
right these Magi are doing these interrogations These are necromancers bro this high priest it's a

00:24:33.419 --> 00:24:40.740
necromancerous Jewish necromancer keep going hurry we gotta hurry yeah and

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:47.039
um so he sends the uh he sends the Virgin out to the Wilderness too and she comes back holoclados everything is fine

00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:52.679
and everybody is amazed right because they couldn't find any falsehood in the

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:59.700
story they didn't reveal anything right and so the priest says you know since well since we can't bring the

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:07.860
bring out any fault then I'm not going to right I'm not going to contradict here what's going on yes yes yes let's

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:16.919
go to the next um text I just wanted to see clados here clarus here ah yes necromantic ties for

00:25:16.919 --> 00:25:22.380
those of you who want to pause that and take a look at it let's go to the next test though I want to go back really

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:28.919
quick to plenty and I want to read this to you the mythradatic antidote is composed of 450 ingredients not of what

00:25:28.919 --> 00:25:33.960
you're using exactly the same proportion and the quantity prescribed is in some

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.419
cases so small as the 60th part of one Denarius that's not very much which of

00:25:39.419 --> 00:25:44.580
the Gods pray can have an instructed man and such trickery as this I hate to

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:50.159
which the mere subtlety of Human Adventure could surely never have reached come on calm down play it

00:25:50.159 --> 00:25:55.860
clearly must emanate from a vain ostentation of scientific skill

00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:03.779
and and must be set down as a monstrous system yes puffling off the Medical Art

00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:09.000
yeah you see that these things are so specific with their measurements for all

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.159
of these ingredients right that they're just showing off their scientific skill

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:21.600
that's all they're doing so when the priest pulls out his um water of of God's judgment and is

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:27.419
able to administer it um don't let it be surprised don't let it surprise you this knowledge is there

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:33.240
this knowledge is there fantastic I want to take you really quick why did we go

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:39.840
to the mythradatic I want you to consider the treacle well for everybody who's in satanic initiation I want you

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.900
to consider the treacle well and consider it that Lewis Carroll took

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:51.960
Alice there with her sisters in a boat he didn't take her to the well but he

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.600
talked about the will in Oxford and he said there are three girls that live at

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:04.080
the bottom of this well right that treacle that word Trico is based off the Greek theriac

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:12.240
and for those of you who have been paying attention this explosion of knowledge comes

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:20.100
partially because of what Lewis Carroll's advisor is doing in Classics so if you really want to understand

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:28.679
Alice in Wonderland and the use of the treacle well um you want you want to dip into

00:27:28.679 --> 00:27:35.159
Antiquity um yes and then all of a sudden the symbols are there and instead of saying

00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:41.760
like that terrible English translation you know they sent them off in the woods and they came back and it makes no sense

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:47.820
with you know where's the drug involved by the way and it says after that he untied their hands it says he he

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:53.880
released their bonds and let them go right so this is exactly a match is

00:27:53.880 --> 00:28:01.080
plenties um almost contemporary description right plenty's first century this gospel is

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:06.779
really second century it's like 150-ish somewhere around there so

00:28:06.779 --> 00:28:14.520
um yeah it's per it's okay you're within you know 80 years of each other that's

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:21.299
you know it's not much so it's good contemporary evidence plenty and the

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:28.559
gospel are using the same language to illustrate the same type of event yeah it's wonderful and

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:33.900
um what I'll do is I'll continue with this uh through Neil tomorrow and I'll

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:39.600
stick informant tomorrow and we'll talk about some of the hardcore drug texts

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:47.760
and what they're doing uh what doctors are doing in Antiquity and kind of look at that side that narcotic side if you

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:54.779
will of everything I want to tie this all up into a nice with a nice bow

00:28:54.779 --> 00:29:01.860
and say the world that we're learning about that's there in the Greek

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:08.580
is not the world that we're being given there is an ideological war I I'm in

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:14.700
complete agreement Derek is right there's an ideological

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:21.179
war going on and that war has been going on for a long time and it is meant to

00:29:21.179 --> 00:29:28.279
obscure reality it is obfuscation at its best

00:29:28.279 --> 00:29:35.100
Christianity as they said in antiquity is meant for one thing and one thing

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:41.700
alone power the acquisition of power when you start

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:49.080
burning down the museum you are doing so to set your path to

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:55.020
power we are in conflict things that I say are not what your

00:29:55.020 --> 00:30:02.940
preachers are going to tell you but you should know they're out there they're out there and they're real and

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:08.760
we have a duty we have a duty a servant to the Muse we have a duty to protect those texts

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:16.020
and those who claim to be Guardians who have taken these new testament texts and say these are ours you seminarians you

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:21.120
priests shame on you

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:28.080
for letting your guard down shame on you for claiming your expertise when you

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:34.320
have none it's disgusting long live the Muse hail

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:41.280
Satan [Music]

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:48.360
[Applause] [Music] maybe I will too

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.099
just put on different [Music]
