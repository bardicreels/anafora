when he was Meo when he was a miros when he was a little kid um when he wasn't

00:14:19.199 --> 00:14:24.680
yet quite to the point of his complete Bloom

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:30.560
oron he was coming in to see season right put

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:38.440
yourself in the greatek shoes um that's how they're thinking about it when he was that young lad they

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.720
will translate it the Brits will translate it um back from 1850 he was a

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:50.519
young lad ah without the beard a young lad so

00:14:50.519 --> 00:15:00.680
the text say and what happens um just jump down to the third line on aen

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:07.680
por everybody in Greek knows what is that por that means he was

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:14.680
prostituting um he was engaging in sexual activity um that's the proper

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:21.040
translation he was engaging in sexual activity before being through puberty

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:29.199
yes yes right we're talking about the L and the company that is kept by the L

00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:35.959
and we're going to start with the Apostle this Alexander is the Apostle

00:15:35.959 --> 00:15:42.120
are you ready so um he porned himself he went out and look on the next line

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:49.199
ksun yeah he he entered into intercourse for cash for an

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:56.880
exchange right and he did so with anybody who had the urge anybody who had the

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:04.720
urge okay um he's very smart Alexander was very

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.839
smart very smart and he figured out at a young age he

00:16:10.839 --> 00:16:18.079
knew what was going to pay the bills he knew how to make it and he was

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:24.199
gonna use his good looks to get there he was gonna use his good looks right

00:16:24.199 --> 00:16:33.959
fortunately Lucian says that wore off that wore off and that charm so when it did he entered into other aspects of

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:40.759
being a lace St being an apprentice and then graduating up to the one who took

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:45.880

Phillip

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:12.480
there we go oh I don't know how much of that got cut out but I'll just keep going um yeah so he says look he says

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:20.559
look um the guy was a doctor and this guy knew drugs and then he quotes Homer

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:27.600
right because he's I don't know lucian's just got to show everybody he's educated and literate and how did you show people

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:34.600
you were educated in the ancient world you quoted Homer you mean you didn't quote the

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:40.600
Bible no that thing's not around till the third Century right no you don't

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:46.320
quote that you quote Homer you quote Homer that shows that you've learned

you've learned your letters fantastic what about those other languages what other

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:59.840
languages show me bring me besides a few fragments of BS show me some literature

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:06.760
they don't have it because the language is equipped to handle the

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.919
burden that's the magic of the Greek that's the magic I'm GNA show you a word

00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:19.480
you're not going to believe exists there's nothing we get like that in English you're not going to find it in Hebrew you're not going to find it in in

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.919
telling the quote in Homer was about drugs it was about drugs and some there are the some drugs that are really good

strong drugs that are helpful and healing and there are other drugs you know what I mean that'll take you into a

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:27.200
place of Darkness it'll bring you into that zone who right that's the kind of

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:34.279
stuff that it these Bronze Age people are doing and most famous of them are the women media

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:39.519
and Cersei love it okay look at this quote

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.559
here I just want to focus one more time that he's a child in our book He's a

00:23:45.559 --> 00:23:51.039
child he's not through puberty yet right he's right at the point of right at the point of

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:58.600
ripening perfect ripening is how they looked at it and I mean perfect is in farming perfect you know

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:04.760
um coming to the point of collection when one goes out and collects the fruit

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:11.480
that's how it's being talked about you see okay when you start reading Jesus

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:18.320
more closely you're going to now recognize you're going to see the images

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:25.559
that I'm giving you and you're going to recognize it in his little speeches now to his sheepies to his

00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:33.240
sheepies yes what are you doing with that Woman Jesus okay go bring us the next text Jey

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:38.600
up look at this people this is time for just a definition of mayrock this is a

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:45.000
young girl right marakon was the other the boy right but I just want you to see

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.919
look how they defined it you know um you know lass okay what is a lass how old is

00:24:50.919 --> 00:24:57.840
a lass kind of a young you know yeah exactly the age that they're trying to

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:04.760
describe that Lucian is giving us that age of growing into ripeness contemplate

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:14.159
that for one minute please contemplate that this is how they're aging people uhhuh when did you

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:21.240
get to ripeness when did you become the fruit to be picked that's how they're looking

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:27.000
at it all right it's very farming very agricultural the people are steeped in

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.080
it John sco told me once he said never forget 90% of these people are

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:41.200
farmers yeah okay fantastic love it love it let's go to the next one what is this

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:47.000
one this is a word break I just want you to conceptualize this for a minute blow

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.679
that up chewy yep that one too love it look look people what is mus what is mus

00:25:54.679 --> 00:26:02.200
uh oh look at Raman numer number two to breathe hard especially during

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:09.600
compulation it comes from a Greek root that means to

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:17.279
Gran to Gran you can Gran within the right you

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:25.640
can enter that state of groaning that bringing out that

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:32.200
state is produced through this moose through

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:38.559
this breath this breath during

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:44.679
compulation brings the moan brings the moan okay you mean they had a word for

00:26:44.679 --> 00:26:53.000
that they had a verb for doing that yes they did I defy you to find something so

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.720
complex so complex um and so detailed in any other

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:06.080
language including Latin including and very much including Latin the Romans know that they know that even modern

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.120
classicists know that right they know the difference between the helist and the

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:17.559
latinist right and I put the medievalist with the latinist we know

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.520
that

00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:45.080
I'm back look at that into the

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:53.480
ab through the so I feel recharged Che bring us up with the next Source let's

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:59.440
just hit people people don't get scared it's about to get kind of scary kind of

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:05.760
yeah right um just remember he porated freely a

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:13.399
por he entered into sexual relations freely it's very important for

00:28:13.399 --> 00:28:20.320
you to realize that okay when you start looking at the grooming process of L and

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:28.080
you can see it in Jesus's actions realize it's all a part of the game right this is what a l is remember he's

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.760
raising his hand saying I am not a leace when they arrest him okay let's keep

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:39.559
going next one next one this is going to get a little bit um oh yeah okay people

00:28:39.559 --> 00:28:44.679
look I want to take you somewhere where classes don't normally take people into

00:28:44.679 --> 00:28:51.559
the kind of into the most

00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:58.320
intimately um real of the language that you can possibly get um let's look at

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:06.159
this verse this is from the Bible right and um the one who betrayed him right this is Mark the one who betrayed him

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:12.440
right he gave a sign to the people and he said look the one whom I kiss right

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:18.760
this is the one you should seize you know grab him grab him and you know

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:25.760
right away straight away he just walks up to Jesus and he says hey there

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:33.559
Rabbi and what is does he do he kind fens him he doesn't Fon him he can't

00:29:33.559 --> 00:29:40.120
fens him there's difference filon would be he kissed

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:45.960
him K filon he kissed him

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:51.799
aggressively in a sexual manner bring me up the next

00:29:51.799 --> 00:29:58.679
definition do you know what Judas did he was making a point to his lace wasn't he

00:29:58.679 --> 00:30:06.559
he was making a point those drugs that he had been giving him and everything yeah what do you think identified him it

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:13.039
was the way Judas kissed him yeah and look at Jesus's reaction

00:30:13.039 --> 00:30:21.000
yeah okay do what you're here to do right right he established that

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.480
connection with his leace master when he was doing it give me that

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.919
defin there we go um where the it's yeah a filo what is a

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:37.720
filo let's go to the one underneath that first yeah so Kil just because you know

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:43.000
people say oh what what are you saying right and it's an outrageous thing to

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:51.200
say you mean Judas was making out with Jesus yeah and Judas is underage yeah

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:57.760
and he's on drugs that Jesus spiked before the

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:04.639
before he ran off into the night oh my God this is a crazy party

00:31:04.639 --> 00:31:09.799
you know what I mean get all the sheriff's officers here because what we're doing is you know we're getting

00:31:09.799 --> 00:31:14.840
ready for that transdimensional arrest right we've got enough information all

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:20.919
we got to do is get the grand jury that's all we need to do and that's what we're getting ready

00:31:20.919 --> 00:31:26.760
to R the the final episode yes fantastic

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:34.480
season seven is the ending by the way right everybody knows that fantastic let's go let's go it's been such an

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:41.880
honor to be able to bring you this information um go back to FMA though I actually wanted to show them that FMA um

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:48.519
people noticed that that word for kissing before um was also um look at

00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:53.760
the bottom especially of an Amorous kiss the Kata

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:59.039
there is an intensifier really kissing him right

00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:07.159
Judas walked straight up to him and really kissed him yeah yeah fantastic

00:32:07.159 --> 00:32:13.480
and what is a FMA don't think that we haven't forgotten about the drugs go to the F the one above that watch this

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:20.120
people FMA oh God what a beautiful word right kisses as prizes in a game as a

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:29.360
symbol this becomes a symbol of Christian love it's in the first epistle to the

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:34.919
corini it's a symbol of the love fests you mean those love fests the Romans are

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:41.440
breaking up because they're all having sex with each other yes and what was the Roman excuse for breaking them up you

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:46.919
can't do that if it's mother and son ew

00:32:46.919 --> 00:32:53.360
that was the Roman response they didn't care people were having orgies right it was all the incest stuff that was going

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:59.200
on with Christians that was the big problem Romans relate look you know ory

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:06.960
away but uh this is gross what you're doing right cool cool yeah that somebody

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:14.279
somebody got it right yeah let's go um to the FMA no one

00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:20.159
more time the FMA people I just don't want you to forget the drugs look look look so what is this symbol of Christian

00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:27.080
love look at number two associated with Cosmetics you know um in that

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:34.440
environment they're saying foras it's Faron um um the most likely explanation

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:40.480
is that those aren't like Cosmetics that you and I think of um they are being

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:47.240
applied the same ways but they're more drug mixtures yeah so pharmacon

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:55.519
classified as pharmacon right so um what is the association between the

00:33:55.519 --> 00:34:01.399
love stuff and the drug drugs it's all there right when he gives Judas that

00:34:01.399 --> 00:34:07.000
bread with the drug in it that's the one that causes the oysters that's the one

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.520
that causes the madness in order to enter that Bic

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:20.520
sexual frenzy yeah fantastic um cult wise I'm saying you

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:27.440
know what I mean it's a you know it's pretty standard though and Lucian says that right he said

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:33.280
he says look look people I got to be honest with you this guy Alexander he's

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:43.560
a terrible human being a terrible human being yeah yeah um but uh I want to show

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:49.720
him to you I want to show you in Vivid detail he was responsible for a kid

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:56.440
getting killed right no it was more than one it was several slaves getting killed

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:02.320
because he thought that they had been Reckless and guy had died somehow and it

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.800
was their fault right it turns out the guy showed up later and then in order to

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:15.640
cover his tracks when the kids showed up in public and they were like hey dirt bag look your kid is here that you

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:21.480
killed those other slaves for he said oh my God pick up rocks and stone the

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:26.560
little guy can you believe that can you believe

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:32.359
that when you so want to cover up the

00:35:32.359 --> 00:35:40.320
reality that you are willing to act atrociously this is the motive of

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:47.599
someone whose reality is breaking down you fight you fight to push that

00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:54.160
scaffolding back up no I've got all my ideas of who Jesus was and I can't

00:35:54.160 --> 00:36:02.760
support them anymore this gets coming down you do whatever it takes even if you got to cover that kid in rocks and

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:08.720
they almost did Stone him but fortunately somebody stepped in right some big wig in the city stepped in and

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:15.760
saved the kid right this is a lace Stace this is a lce

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.800
St right let's go to the next one this is depressing but it's we're almost

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:27.359
through chapter one um I just want you guys to see here's more here's more so

00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:34.920
um he gets involved look take it down I actually got to tell he goes through a couple of Partners and he eventually

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:41.160
decides what I have to do is I have to bring back a cult um that is telling

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:48.280
oracles some kind of shrine I have to have it legitimized he goes through a whole bunch of stuff ends up with a

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:55.839
snake right ends up with a snake that because of his actions people are thinking oh my God this snake is a this

00:36:55.839 --> 00:37:03.240
snake is a prophetic Rebirth of Apollo yeah esus all the power of

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:11.079
medicine funnel into the physical manifestation of a serpent so he's

00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:17.720
traveling around he's traveling around with some part a partner and some um

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:23.960
women who you know solution is just straight up you know they're they're

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:31.720
looking for some sort of entertainment and you know something I don't you know

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:40.079
okay they're traveling they're paying the bills right these are I forgot to mention these are wealthy women wealthy

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:46.800
women who no longer have husbands right and you know perhaps they

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:55.440
wish to Cort so he's cavorting on their dime on their dime um

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:02.800
aulus the the author got prosecuted for this it's called being a

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:09.119
Magus yeah okay so he ends up in Pella in

00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:17.680
Macedon yeah and what's what does he find there just tell us what he finds here this La

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:23.520
days yeah and um he finds there these great serpents these serpents I'm just

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:28.880
going to translate it these serpents are there they're being nourished by the

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:34.720
women who are in this complex and they actually sleep with the children the

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:40.400
serpents they sleep with the children and look you know what happens these

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:46.800
things and I'm going to give you my translation right these things these

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.920
serpents are the ones that they hold

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:58.240
up these are the ones that they stroke

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.520
and when they do when they squeeze them

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:13.560
when they milk them they are not hostile and they drink the milk

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:19.400
from the tee they drink the milk from the tee yes that's what it says in the

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:27.200
same fashion as little babies do many many people have been gener ated

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:34.680
in this way wait a minute people keep listening up many people have been generated this way and that's why they

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:42.480
have that old myth of Olympus the mother of Alexander because when she conceived

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:48.400
Alexander she was with a snake

Jesus

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:23.680
yes and don't think that when Lucian tells us that from this

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:29.240
legitimate doctor he calls him a public physician from

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:35.640
this legitimate doctor he was able to learn amazing

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:43.880
drugs it was the drugs that he got the power of because those Magi those guys

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:49.240
that's how they work is with the drugs that's how they

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:54.680
work yeah you can take a person you can force them into a state we don't do this

00:42:54.680 --> 00:43:01.839
today but let's talk about about it just for a second the Magus he does you can

00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:08.079
take a person you can even interrogate somebody under the right drugs and get the answers out that you need to get out

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:13.160
you don't have to beat them up you can put somebody into a state of psychic

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:19.520
frenzy you can put somebody into a psychosis imagine if there were a drug

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:25.000
that I could give you that would cause you to be insanely psychotic to the

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.480
point that before we give you the drug we're going to tie you down now you mean

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:37.079
you mean whoa hold on you guys Hopkins who were doing the studies and stuff like

00:43:42.559 --> 00:43:49.400
there until you are tying down your patients restraining them right you talk

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:54.800
it you put them in the bed and you have a have a music Source on you're playing

00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:01.040

replicate that true experience no no

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:11.920
until you have them in a psychotic state after administering to them the

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:19.440
drugs rect through a medical probe after inducing a death

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:27.000
State and then a resurrection State what do you think this person is going to do

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:26.200
Maga you remember that stuff Philip was using oh guess what comes out of

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:33.960
Alexander's mouth the same stuff that Phillip said the same stuff that Phillip

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:41.760

so Alexander announced publicly that it was not right to have

00:49:38.599 --> 00:49:43.839
sex with children that it was actually impious but he

00:49:43.839 --> 00:49:52.240
himself entered into a different direction right for to the cities of

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:59.559
pontis and the cities of Paonia he had it announced that he was wanted them to

00:49:59.559 --> 00:50:05.720
send him the boys and not just any boys but

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:10.920
it was necessary that they be

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:20.240
examined and overseen to the point of containing only boys that were yenic

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:26.480
that were what you know what I'm talking about they got no flaws they got no

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:33.400
flaws these are perfect boys what other what other kind of boys does he want he wants the ones that are

00:50:47.839 --> 00:50:56.359
be known for their beauty yeah they got to be known for their beauty and what did he do these

00:50:56.359 --> 00:51:02.680
particular boys that he got as tribute now where do you think these path

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:08.559
lonians where do you think these paffoni and these PE people who are living in

00:51:08.559 --> 00:51:14.920

best of the best the cream of the crop to Alexander you send the best of the

00:51:39.839 --> 00:51:46.640
best this is what a l does this is the job of the

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:52.599
L right when somebody tells you that this word appears so many times and it

00:51:52.599 --> 00:51:59.359
only means this do you see that when the scaffolding falls from the evidence it's

00:51:59.359 --> 00:52:04.640
impossible to hold it up it can only be that is the most

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:10.520
inaccurate incorrect statement I feel bad I don't want you my beloved audience

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:32.720
from the depths the depths of the person who

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:40.559
finds the reality to be too overwhelming to take the person who

00:52:40.559 --> 00:52:45.880
prefers to accept the fantasy knowing

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:53.440
that it is Fallen that it is a false reality right somebody comes to you my

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:59.160
children and says all of the examples of this are not that

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:05.839
listen to what they say all all of the examples it sounds to me it sounds to me

00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:12.559
like you don't know what you're doing with a linguistic sword so stop

00:53:12.559 --> 00:53:19.760
everybody stop behold the L stas let's go to we're

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:26.960
almost yes yes that one yeah that one um look uh here's a naan Cod on the second

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:32.119
line there's a young boy you know oint so they were thinking that this young

00:53:32.119 --> 00:53:42.520
kid as he was sailing was was killed yeah or a a on the second line or they were

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:49.480
thinking that he was abducted by Pirates it doesn't mean pirate by the

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:56.040
way that's a joke he was abducted by

00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:01.480
lace Stone okay why would this young handsome

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:09.160
aristocratic kid be abducted they were

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:14.680
robbers do you hear Do you hear it yet people I'm telling you there are those

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:21.839
in this world who are meant to deceive you they are living in a prison a prison

00:54:21.839 --> 00:54:26.880
of their own fallacy oh oh my God but these lace

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:32.319
dayss are pretty cool um you know not because of what they do but because of

00:54:32.319 --> 00:54:37.640
the incredible impact that it has on the culture I mean

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:43.000
think about it Jesus Christ was one of these or at least he was denying that he

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.880
was one crucified between two

00:54:48.359 --> 00:54:55.200
others yeah I thought those guys were just stealing things no no no you just just

00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:02.680
cut people's hands off for that stuff right yeah yeah these are the people who

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:09.200
control the kid trade so when Jesus is with all of his children and please

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:14.640
people this is making somewhat of an impact people are waking up to this fact

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:20.760

arilus who is seventh century he's a lyric poet right

00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:27.079
seventh century he's creating him for those of you who want to find out the

00:59:27.079 --> 00:59:34.480
relevance he's creating hymns to bakas yob he addresses him as

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:40.359
iob right and arilus very famous guy he made people commit suicide with his

00:59:40.359 --> 00:59:47.440
poetry that's how good he was but he met a um uh his father one day told him hey

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:53.000
go out arilus and get the cows he went out to get the cows found a group of um

00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:00.440
beautiful women and they exchanged his cows for a li a liar a liar right isn't

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:07.520
that nice so he took it home and he started playing music anyway he became one of the most famous musicians of his

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:15.480
time and he was uh called by the Oracle a servant of the Muse right um and was

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:23.720
acknowledged right if you get acknowledged at the oracular level right in the seventh century um

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:31.079
that is a huge deal the only reason that you and I take it down for one second the only reason that you and I have ever

01:00:31.079 --> 01:00:38.559
heard of Socrates Plato and I would argue Aristotle too although Aristotle may

01:00:38.559 --> 01:00:44.039
have made it on its own on his own um but Socrates and Plato the only reason

01:00:44.039 --> 01:00:52.319
you have ever heard those names is because an oracle said um he's the wisest guy in

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:57.920
Athens yeah right right he he knows that he doesn't

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:03.039
know he's the wisest guy in Athens nobody he would have never been famous

01:01:03.039 --> 01:01:08.440
so um there's there are oracles that are doing the that are moving Society

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:14.440
forward like this and arilus is recognized but you know let's see what

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:23.280

there is no long longer anything that's unhoped for

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:35.400
unimaginable there's no sort of Wonder since Zeus the father of

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:43.039
Olympus made the Sun dark in the middle of the

01:01:43.039 --> 01:01:50.799
day he hid that shining sun and now humanity is

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:59.839
terrified now we know know that all things we trust in in all of those

01:01:59.839 --> 01:02:08.920
