clip from Gnostic informant I just want to give you a taste it's a kick in your

teeth are you ready for some history that you didn't know are you ready for some of the dark dark

goodness ah some of that antimatter here we go um chewy I'm gonna

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.040
have chewy run this clip right up front right up front hit it according to St

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.040
epiphanius the following passage is from a lost Gospel called greater questions

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.080
of Mary Jesus Took Mary Magdalene aside and

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.640
brought her to the top top of a mountain praying he produced a woman from his

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.200
side he began to have sex with her then partaking of his Omission he says eat my

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.000
flesh and drink my blood thus we must do that we may live and when Mary was

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.200
alarmed she fell to the ground he raised her up and said to her oh thou of little

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.720
faith wherefore did thou doubt and they say that this is the mean of the Gospel

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.560
if I have told you Earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe in

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.239
the Heavenly things and so when you see the son of man ascending up where he was

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.239
before in other words when you see the admission being partaken of it where it

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.920
came and then Christ said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood one cannot

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.319
enter the Kingdom of Heaven Jesus was asking Mary to drink his semen and

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:11.040
the disciples were Disturbed in reply all right so I wanted you to see

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.160
that ancient source um fantastic it is epiphanous we're talking about and

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.680
epiphanous is going to be um preserving for us a whole bunch of the history of

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.520
early Christianity and people like to poooo him and like to say oh

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:39.160
epiphanous everything you say is wrong and questionable because oh it's so

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.280
disgusting now on the classic side it's not so disgusting it's things that

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.080
they're doing in mystery cult so it's not shocking and it shouldn't be taken it should be handled as a source I was

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.880
reading epiphanous today um because Gnostic mentioned mentioned uh him and

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.479
uh he says very very very clearly look the

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.479
pagans right those Greek authors how he talks about them is the Greek authors in different fields you know

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:17.120
historiographers etc etc you know it's very sophisticated what good stuff and he

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.639
says hey um these Greek people you know um they're always invoking calling upon

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:30.360
this Muse and um this Muse is an Earthly Dion

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.840
and then he differentiates the muse from the Christian Dion he who is called the

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.000
Tyrant and that Christian power is um

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.120
able to do certain things blah blah blah says ous and then he goes through a list he goes through a list of all of these

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:57.240
different sects oh my God it must be a thousand of those things no it's not a thousand it's probably I don't know I

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:05.680
didn't count them but it's dozens and dozens doz and dozens and dozens so couple hundred at least um yeah maybe a

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:13.479
hundred maybe hundred any who what I want you to notice is one of them has a gospel one of these Christian groups has

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:20.000
a gospel where jesus takes Mary Magdalene up into the mountain oh God

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.120
it's gonna go baky from here isn't it yes it is don't worry about it it fits

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.360
right into the mystery but what does Mary Magdalene do

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.440
she is forcibly the

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:43.479
receptacle of the Hima of Jesus for those of you who

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:50.720
thought these things are all made up I want you to realize they're coming to us right out of the Greek right out of the

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.680
Greek and as people begin to see this and they begin to say oh my you know

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.720
it's there's always that Awakening that moment punch in the face right you mean

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:10.160
Jesus was up in the mountain with Mary Magdalene it makes sense about why they were calling a prostitute and all that

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.479
kind of stuff like that it makes sense let's jump let's jump head first right

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:21.960
into some words tonight now at Al andu tonight technically we're looking we're

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:29.080
starting unit one because everybody hit the alphabet and we all know it we all

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.720
know it we can say it now if they stop us and make us say the alphabet walk

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:41.160
lines we can say it don't do that though um here we go in unit one and what I

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:48.080
want to introduce you to what is unique to am and you that you won't get anywhere else is I'm going to show you

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:54.319
how words work in the hands of great great mother this is gorgeous give me

00:07:54.319 --> 00:08:00.840
the first one get no give me the first one up at the top up at the top beautiful give me the first one here we

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:08.039
go before before we get there I need you to know for reference sake because

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:13.479
you're going to be dealing with people from the biblical study side and the religious history and that that

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:20.039
religious history is a little bit better but the biblical study side those people are awful and they take the reality and

00:08:20.039 --> 00:08:26.960
they contort it and they say there's a reality that is ours the Christian reality and it's this fairy tale and

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:33.479
then there's paganism and everything else right and the two are not the same thing they're differentiating between

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:38.919
two people walking down the same Roman sidewalk oh

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:44.159
God what lies we're gonna get rid of the first

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:49.959
linguistic lie tonight as you're sitting here in am and you and you are entering

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:57.519
into the study of ancient Greek I want you to realize what ancient Greek is what does it say to it says how many

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:03.839
words did ancient Hebrew have because the biblical studies people are going to be throwing Hebrew at you it's

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:10.240
completely irrelevant completely historically irrelevant it is

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:17.000
a lie a language of fabrication how do we know that look

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.360
look how many words did ancient Hebrew have according to the gillad zachman the

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:30.079
number of a tested Biblical Hebrew words is 8,198 of which some 2,000 are hopos hopx

00:09:30.079 --> 00:09:36.640
leina the number of Biblical Hebrew roots on which many of these words are based is around

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:43.320
2,000 okay bear that in mind bear that in mind ready hit me with the tlg this

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:50.360
is the thesaurus lingua gai it's a program that was put together when I was in graduate school had nothing to do

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:57.160
with it right and it's able to search you're able to be able to to um do

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:04.600
searches on specific words and find all the examples of where they are in the 4,000 plus authors that we

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:11.000
have okay watch the number of Greek words in the Corpus amounts to

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.120
110 million 110 million oh my God you are so

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.519
beautiful lady Greek you are so beautiful 110 million you can't even

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:27.320
fathom how much th thinkery has been oh

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:34.480
while the number of unique word forms and this is the one that's really important I want you to pay attention as future classical philologist I want you

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:41.720
to pay attention unique word forms is at 1.6 million how many did we have in

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.880
Hebrew a couple thousand and of those you know there's a lot of place names

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.160
and whatnot so you only got a few thousand words that you're a that um

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:58.760
have been left behind right through a fabrication process have been left

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:05.839
behind it's really unworkable it's unworkable um what is the gr C it's got

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:15.279
1.6 million okay 1.6 million unique words and you are

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:21.200
going to start forming those unique words and I'm going

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.839
to show you today how to do that are you ready I'm going to flash up a word boom

00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:33.839
hisor look people how is that spelled called yoda Sigma to Omron row Yoda

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:42.560
Alpha where is the accent it's over the eoda it's Historia not

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.639
Historia okay nice and what is that little looks like the open an open

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:54.000
quotation over the eoda that is the rough

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.240
breathing which means we're going to add an H sound hisor

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.560
not istoria but hisor Fantastic look look at how

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:14.040
gorgeous this is now what is this word mean I want you to look at this word and mentally I want you to kill every vowel

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:22.920
what are our vowels here Yoda Omron Yoda Alpha I want you to kill them

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:29.360
and what do you have left you have Sigma toal row what is that you say that

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.800
doesn't seem nice all the vowels are doing in Greek is

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.839
tuning the Bas right tuning that

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:46.079
root tuning it watch this hisor Sigma Ro

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:51.399
is our root go to the next one and what do we do with that root first of all

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:57.920
what is the word hisor mean notice they're going to give you inquiry right up front right think about this think

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.639
about this when you read at the third grade level of the Torah from the mastic

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:11.480
text that they back translated in a thousand right on OD Domin when you're reading at that third grade level you're

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:17.519
not going to be able to get the nuances that you can in the Greek watch

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:23.560
inquiry look at look under a are you ready people people systematic or

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:31.760
scientific observation is that sexy is that sexy it's not

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.240
sheep right it's sexy it's not sheep it's

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:43.639
sexy oh God look at it linguistic sexiness geometry talking about in in

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:49.839
relation to Geometry knowledge obtained or information right what is that science

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:57.720
that we're going to be using it's a an attempt to obtain knowledge baby it says on the Temple of Apollo know yourself

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:04.680
these people are all about nosis they are all about

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:12.639
understanding and that is what is in the word hisor now I tell all of my Greek

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:19.639
students I tell them when you're looking at a word most of the time the overwhelming

00:14:19.639 --> 00:14:25.560
majority of the time that word is going to be derived from a verb from an

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:33.240
action yeah not always but a good majority of the time go back to the verb

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.440
always go back to the verb that this word comes from next slide and you'll

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:46.199
see where um it'll give you kind of a sense first of all what do we have up here look what look what happened to my

00:14:46.199 --> 00:14:52.120
word it's like a rabbit it had a whole bunch under the fertility god of Ancient

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:59.199
Greek it had a whole bunch of Offspring while we were sitting there talking look at these hiso right at the top there

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:04.279
practice people there's your verb there's your

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:10.839
verb and you don't want to know what that verb means it means to ask the Oracle your

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:14.360
question is that

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:26.160
gorgeous you like that look as we're going through what are you noticing is your eyes as your eyes are moving over

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:32.279
these are you noticing the same roote the same route look when we get about

00:15:32.279 --> 00:15:38.360
halfway down we have historiographia what do you think

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:44.079
historiographia is if I tell you graph is the root for

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:52.199
writing historiography the very idea now that's a pretty good word for the SATs you know

00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:57.920
what I mean that's a pretty good one um this not one that everybody uses today

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:05.120
and a lot of these words that you're going to come across that the anglosaxon tongue has

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.800
managed to to hijack um those Concepts you're going to

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:19.360
notice they're kind of at a you know it's kind of at an elevated level technically right what is historiography

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.680
h yes yes oh love it love it and what

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:31.759
else do we have what else do we have here at the bottom um yeah historian what is a

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:38.800
historian that's a fact baby that's a fact it's an incident it's reality An

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:44.920
Occurrence really oh that's what our minds going now give me give me some of

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:50.839
the English oh sorry give me the next one here's the verb people that we're looking for and I want you to say it

00:16:50.839 --> 00:16:57.920
since you're learning the Greek spell it out for me Yoda Sigma to Omron row

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.199
Epsilon Omega he and you realize by the way you

00:17:03.199 --> 00:17:08.319
realize it 730 people this is the biggest fraking Greek class on the

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:13.760
planet it's the biggest ancient Greek class on the planet and for those of you

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.959
because there's been so many orders for the Greek put off for a long time you

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:25.079
can't get these things for a long time there are Avenues I want you to mingle with the

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:31.200
community the satanic congregation and I want you to find out how it's possible

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:38.160
for you to for you to be able to learn this ancient Greek with without um um

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.919
without the privilege of money yeah I want you to find it I know

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:50.240
there are those of you who are looking keep looking right good fantastic hiso

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:56.400
how do we say it hiso and funny thing is the joke's on all of us because you're never going to

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.559
see this form because that those last two vowels are going to get subsumed

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:11.720
into one they're gonna get that Omega is gonna suck that Epsilon in Greek vowels ancient Greek vowels are

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:18.760
tuners they're tuners and some of them have different powers and that Omega is

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:24.280
the ultimate black hole it will suck in whatever whatever whatever vow you want

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:32.440
to put in there uh lovely here's the verb that it comes from right give me the next one now what happens you say

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:39.720
well this looks like a totally different word nope it's not what is this

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:46.840
oyas excuse me oyas where did he say Estus yes I

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:51.919
did this is where we get estris from but I want you to

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:58.280
notice kill the vowels and that terminal Sigma that terminal Sigma is just

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:04.760
dressing it's part of the it's part of the um declension right it's the part of

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:10.760
the it's just telling you what case it is this is syntax we're dealing with baby we're going to get into syntax and

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.559
I'll tell you what it is but it's just dressing for the what it's doing in the sentence it's just telling you hey I'm

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:23.159
gonna be the subject in the sentence right um so it's not part of the root what happens when you kill the vowels

00:19:23.159 --> 00:19:29.600
you get Sigma row wait a minute you mean if I

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:37.039
modify that front vowel that I can change the word you're starting to get it you're

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:44.919
starting to get it you see how they play you see how they play this is music this is freaking music Oxford just did a

00:19:44.919 --> 00:19:51.520
great bit on uh reclaiming the OS um that musical instrument readed

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:57.760
instrument um they did a fantastic job with notation of music oh God those

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:05.600
nerds they're CL clist right this is the kind of stuff that advances the study

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:12.159
that advances our understanding of History theology doesn't do that theology is not meant to do that there

00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:19.120
is no inquiry in theology you are not meant to ask a question right hence hail

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:25.400
Satan fantastic let's go to the next one Boom o look here's another one now you

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:31.520
can slightly tune it slightly tune it with from the alpha to the Epsilon and

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:38.080
what's going to happen it's going to slightly change its meaning yeah now people in different

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.400
regions will use different vowels have a propensity to different vowels okay fine

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.440
um you've got to find the register you've got to find the place where that

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:56.600
word is anchored and that place is that root Sigma row keep thinking Sigma row

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:02.600
another word this is just you don't have to m mizing this I just want you to follow everybody should be following the

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:08.559
Greek when it's individual words I'm going to give you a giant definition here now you ready I want you to see

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:14.120
this o the former in plural okay fine you don't have to give us all the look

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:19.559
and they give us the beautiful one's in theocritus oh God look at the

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:25.440
OA what does it mean properly of the gadlight the oyster

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:33.600
it's to sting to sting look at definition number two Roman numeral number two to go mad and to rage it's

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.679
used of IO raging that's where we get our concept of estris

00:21:38.679 --> 00:21:46.720
frenzy frenzy is this a sexual frenzy yes it is yes it is okay hit me with the

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:54.400
next one keep him in the zone watch this people um this is the

00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.880
argument okay so let me let me step back having just seen what we're doing doing we're working with word bases and we're

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:06.960
following words through time we're following definitions of them right I've got some ancient definitions for those

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:16.320
that I'm going to bring up um look what happens here what have I got here I've got the verb now that the word Christ is

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:24.120
based in this is the base of Christ and christing what is it de now I told you

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:30.200
it's to be stung by that gadfly and everybody says oh the the biblical

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:38.039
scholar Dan mclen steps up and what is his reputation of that his reputation is oh

00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:44.799
look he picked the bottom he picked the bottom definition you know what he didn't read Dan you didn't read anything

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:50.000
between the top and the bottom and that is not an academic ex that's not

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.279
scientific because you pick the bottom one what are you talking about do you know how to read these definitions Dan

00:22:57.279 --> 00:23:02.760
you don't they are marked with the Greek interior to the definition so that you

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:08.279
can follow the word as it develops something Victorian classical

00:23:08.279 --> 00:23:15.640
philologist gave us that biblical Scholars do not learn are you ready put your Greek where

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:22.520
your mouth is put it up there blow it up I want you to look look at number um at

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:28.080
the end of the first paragraph to touch the surface of the body is this really a

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.520
thing about contact it's about application look at

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:41.120
definition Roman number one to Rob anoint with scented uents is

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:48.039
oil okay so you're getting the idea application some kind of anguin or

00:23:48.039 --> 00:23:55.480
anguin drugs yes an Antiquity anguin or pharmica okay anything to affect your

00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:03.400
balance is going to affect a physiological balance according to the doctors is going to be a drug and look

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:09.320
at the third line under Roman numeral number one to at the end of it to rub or

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:15.360
infect with poison and they're talking about a peplos there they're talking

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:23.279
about a a piece of fabric right they're talking about a a dress but um some kind

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:29.000
of clothing into which you have impregnated you have CED some something

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:37.159
do we have examples of all of these taking of poisons and putting them into clothing yes a very good example is

00:24:37.159 --> 00:24:45.240
Heracles remember he's the one who puts on the shirt that's full of the poison what happens to him it kills him

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:51.760
remember what media does she poisons that peplos that that woman wears and hers

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:57.200
bursts in the flame Isn't that cool and it's the the more water you throw on it

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:04.960
the just it just it just eats the water it's like some kind of

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:10.320
Napalm naughty people oh God and um so

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.679
do we have the impregnation of this of of the different strips and bandages and

00:25:15.679 --> 00:25:21.600
all that kind of stuff sure all of that is there and all of that is within the definition of

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.440
christing right right now so you can take your Biblical Hebrew scholar and

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:34.840
you can set him back and he can say something that's absurd but you cannot tell the difference that's what this

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:39.880
class is for for you to be able to tell the difference so that you don't get

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:46.080
taken out now I wanna I want to say something I'm I'm gonna go ahead and say

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:51.559
this put down your put down your stylus for a

00:25:51.559 --> 00:25:57.159
minute if we were in Rome we'd be writing with a stylus in a wax tablet

00:25:57.159 --> 00:26:02.640
put down your stylus and if and this one Christian guy he got murdered by all students because he was

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:09.279
doing nasty stuff but anyway um I want to tell you today they stabbed him with

00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:14.679
their stylist is that would that'd be a terrible way to die um any who um you

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.399
announcement okay um there are people out there who will

00:26:32.399 --> 00:26:38.840
intellectually lure you into a back alley and they will they will do things

to your brain that you know maybe you didn't realize at the time it was going on you can go see a

form now and it was apparent right away even to a classicist a classical

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:24.720
philologist we don't do cfor but as a classical philologist you have to have a certain exposure so I

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:47.638
just throw out there really quick there is a really great project that's being done um by a guy who goes by the name

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:54.560
old boy a u l d b o y and he went to see

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.640

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:06.440
purple there's more coming right there's more prophecy coming um and he's making excellent videos that

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:12.960
are historically grounded and the reason I mentioned this at amanu is because he

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:19.480
has gone through the Intensive Greek course yes yeah now he's at the

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:26.200
intermediate level and he's reading yeah he's reading and he will tell you oh God

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:31.480
Greek it's so mammoth so huge right the more you the more you talk to somebody

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:37.800
who's had more and more Greek the more respect they have for the language it is it is endless like this we're talking

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:44.280
about we're dealing with one rot tonight can you believe that oh God hit us with the next one chewy hit us with the next

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:49.560
one oystra daos driven Round and Round by the gantly do you feel do you feel

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:56.560
people like sometimes you got oyster you're oyster genetic right think about that word how are we going to do that in

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:02.480
English my brain is it's under the influence you see it

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:07.920
does it all matters as you're being grown as a child it all matters what

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:14.280
language you're speaking it matters yeah look what they got to with

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:22.119
Mother Greek look what they got to all of your science God driven Round and Round by

00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:28.920
the Gat flag give me the next one I want to keep hitting this look oy foros now people do you see what happening now

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:35.560
we're taking multiple roots and we're putting them together here you see the sigma tal row root because you're

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:42.520
killing you're killing all the vowels and then you see the F root and what is

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:49.960
that that's the bearing root the verb to bear or to carry is

00:45:31.079 --> 00:45:38.680
right hit me with the next one hit me with the next one oyster ples because I suddenly am stung by the gadfly and

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:45.440
driven wild wild and I am a bant

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:51.800
Christ I am a boning Christ the bit of anything take it down for a minute chewy

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:57.040
of anything that I've told you this will make the biggest splash

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:03.280
because um this will drive a a a wedge into between the false history that's

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:09.200
been built up for you full of this Christian theology judeo-christian

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:14.720
monest theology This Will Destroy it the the

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:20.640
name the word Christ it's not a name it's a title the word Christ is a drug

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:27.319
term Jesus was a drug guy we just looked at putting drugs onto cloth do you

00:46:27.319 --> 00:46:32.440
remember the woman who had the issue of blood what did she do all she had to do

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:38.480
was touch him all she had to do was touch him you know why because that Christ was

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:46.680
christed and he was walking around high and full of drugs they put them on their

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.880
clothing now some of you say how stupid is that well some of the sophisticated ones you could light that stuff on fire

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:58.920
make a little make a little you know impression on people some of that stuff

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:06.720
would be immediately toxic oh fantastic you know what I do if I'm a

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:12.200
priestess and I'm eight years old I'm getting up every morning I'm training to

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:18.839
be the one of the Medusa you know what I do I cut I make lateral Cuts in my arms

00:47:18.839 --> 00:47:24.319
and then I take a linen bandage and I impregnate with drugs that I then put

00:47:24.319 --> 00:47:29.440
over and those drugs are the ones that we're all taking from the snakes because that's what they're teaching us to do

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:38.000
now is to handle those snakes because if you're a good Christian and you follow Jesus's precise words you will take up

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.640
snakes and you'll start drinking death drugs and they won't hurt

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:52.119
you do you see it's the real Jesus it's the real

00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:59.160
Jesus hit the next one and you can get there through the words OES that's that's fine raging or frantic give me

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:04.800
the next one no problem that's we're hitting it here's the word for Star a

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:10.200
and I wanted you to see it same route again people same route fantastic give

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:17.520
me the next one fantastic boom boom here's Jude who do who do I not want you

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:23.599
to be I don't want you to be like these people why because from they've been

00:48:23.599 --> 00:48:30.839
practicing this mystery for a long time and it always ends up and Sodom and gomorah you know they're using the same

00:48:30.839 --> 00:48:35.880
methods right and what are they doing they're going after that heteros SARS

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:41.839
right that that other flesh the other meat yeah and what are they doing

00:48:41.839 --> 00:48:47.760
they're providing example they're providing an example of that ionic

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:53.280
fire right that ionic fire they're going to be subject to

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:59.119
dek because they are harnessing the ionic fire now this is the part I told

00:48:59.119 --> 00:49:06.319
you there's no Christian who knows what this means none none well I don't know maybe there is maybe there is somewhere

00:49:06.319 --> 00:49:13.400
who got his Greek in gear or hers and really pushed I would say hers but you know realistically Bible studies doesn't

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:19.240
really encourage I mean they do have you know it's I don't know I don't know um

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:26.160
yeah the first thing I noticed about Classics was it was majority women in my department yeah and I thought how how

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:33.559
nice look at this the women are encouraged to study this right because

00:49:33.559 --> 00:49:38.720
it doesn't say women submit it doesn't say that it's got all sorts of stuff

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:44.040
look at it look at this thing I found I've got this word I found for you guys tonight it's gorgeous I hadn't seen it

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:14.880
don't care anyway right I do care ultimately but it's not up to me to decide what was going on in Jesus Christ

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:23.240
said when he was arrested in a public park with a naked kid look at the next verse here from Jude oh God what are

too go give me give me that one okay look there are a couple of very very important little paragraphs little

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:36.640
charts that I need you to know as you are reading unit one and I tell people

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:42.520
get your alphabet down that's what you need if you've gotten your alphabet down and if you're able to begin looking at

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:50.079
Greek words um and pronouncing them you're in a good spot but what I want you to do is I want you to read unit one

00:58:50.079 --> 00:58:55.799
and I want you to try to do those first five exercises in unit one and I'm going to walk you through those now if you've

00:58:55.799 --> 00:59:03.359
done them great if you're going to do them great but I want you to notice I'm going to give you only the stuff that

00:59:03.359 --> 00:59:09.520
you need this is the stuff that's going to get us through this specialized training are you ready look at these

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:16.760
diff thongs on the left what is a diff thong a d thong is when you take two vowels and you put them together what

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:26.200
vowels are we talking about Alpha Epsilon Ada Yoda Omron oilon Omega I

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:35.520
that one more time Alpha Epsilon Ada eota Omron Upsilon Omega seven vowels

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:41.240
those are the seven spheres of the

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:46.520
cosmos wait what those are the seven

00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:52.760
spheres of the cosmos what is cosmos it is the

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:59.480
organization of the universe it's the organization are you ready the

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:08.200
organization has those seven vowels Alpha Epsilon Ada Yoda Omron oilon Omega

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:15.119
okay when you combine those together like the first one that we have is alpha eoda alpha eoda and when you take two

01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:21.440
vowels and they combine into one they make one noise right you go from alpha

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:27.400
eota is a e combine them together you get

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.520
I I makes a different sound um Epsilon

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:39.440
eoda you have e in the Epsilon e in the Yoda when you combine them together

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:46.640
a okay and that's what I want I want you to follow this pronunciation for oi we

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:54.760
look at oops okay wait a minute look at oops Yoda and you're going to think that's o and E right so we something

01:00:54.760 --> 01:01:01.799
like that notice that you get a w sound that starts coming out why because there is a diagma hiding in that

01:01:01.799 --> 01:01:08.280
oilon you mean a consonant is in there being close with that vow yeah it

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:14.960
happens right oh love it we we here the

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:22.480
wson is we we weos is the word for sun oilon eot

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:27.920
Omron Sigma whoos good you're going to give vocabulary don't worry so people

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:34.599
focus on this chart get all of your diff thongs down so you can pronounce words you can pronounce words like the words

01:01:34.599 --> 01:01:41.520
they give you in the example look you've got the the first word there a a see the

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.760
D thong eye on the front of it good practice that get it down go to the next

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:54.000
one go to the next one um word roots I tell you give me a blow up look at this

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.279
chart at the bottom this box summary of Greek cases I want you to look at these

01:01:59.279 --> 01:02:07.359
five cases what are cases cases are part of noun adjectives

01:02:07.359 --> 01:02:13.760
participles have cases yeah now what do you do with a case just think about a

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:19.599
noun for a minute and this is where everybody learns this so don't be embarrassed um a verb is your action

01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:26.440
it's the word that's the doing the jumping the running the being being is doing to yeah

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:33.000
what is a noun it's you know we call it the person place or thing what I want you to know is the nouns are the things

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.720
that can be doing or can have things done to them they are the dressing for

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:46.920
the verb oh okay okay I get it watch this there each of them has

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:54.319
cases what does that mean it means the end of the word will change changing its case and what cases do we have do you

01:02:54.319 --> 01:02:59.520
need to think through this no stop trying to if you get confused whenever

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:05.000
you get confused in ancient Greek stop thinking I tell my students this all the

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.839
time nobody ever trusts me until they get to a point where they understand what it means stop

01:03:12.839 --> 01:03:19.160
thinking what do you need to know you need to know these five cases every now

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:24.319
is going to have five cases the first case is called the

01:03:24.319 --> 01:03:30.160
nominative yeah that's all I need you to say spit that out how many cases five

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:35.760
okay thank you very much what's the first one nominative what is the first

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:42.520
case nominative nominative nominative what is the second genitive third dative

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:47.760
fourth accusative what is that fifth type of case that they

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.440
vocative vocative now what we're going to do is we're going to use those first

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:59.119
four cases all the time and every once in a while we're going to use that fifth

01:03:59.119 --> 01:04:05.039
case and when we do I'll make it obvious for you because all we're going to

01:04:05.039 --> 01:04:10.400
memorize are those first four I don't want you memorizing vocatives I want you

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:16.480
memorizing nominative genitive dative accusative and always in that order nominative now I'm going to tell you

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.799
this once what each of those is the nominative case is the subject that's

01:04:21.799 --> 01:04:27.599
all I want I don't want you to think about it I want you to be able to say when I yell at you in your face what is

01:04:27.599 --> 01:04:34.200
the nominative case and you will say it is the subject what is the genitive case it is

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:41.240
the case of possession what is the dative case it's the indirect

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:46.440
object I don't even know what an indirect object is you say I don't care

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:52.880
I need you to know that the dative case is an indirect object just stop there

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:59.200
what's the accusative a direct object isn't that nice nominative subject

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:04.480
genitive possession dative indirect object accusative direct object that's

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:11.359
all I need you to do the vocative is a case of a dress and it's barely used

01:05:11.359 --> 01:05:16.760
okay so we're not gonna um we're going to worry about the top four next one

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:24.119
give me the next one what else do I need you to focus on in chapter one these are first declension nouns now what does

01:05:24.119 --> 01:05:30.559
that mean what is declension thank a declin is a family or a group of nouns

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:38.079
we're going to have three in Greek we're gonna have three this is the first and

01:05:38.079 --> 01:05:43.400
most of these are feminine they are feminine what you mean nouns can have

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:50.160
gender yes yes what are the genders that we have in Greek we have masculine

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:56.039
feminine neuter masculine feminine neuter masculine feminine and neuter

01:05:56.039 --> 01:06:01.400
that's all I want you to know mfn are you ready here's some feminine

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:08.440
ones for you and what happens what are these what is going on in this chart it's a little Dash with a letter or a

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:16.079
couple of letters after it and that little Dash is telling you you can take this and put it on the end of a the base

01:06:16.079 --> 01:06:25.119
of a noun in order to make it that case for example the word for soul is

01:06:26.279 --> 01:06:35.880
you hear the A on the end of it that's the nominative it's the subject the soul

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:42.880
lives right the Soul's the subject the soul eats worms the soul is the subject

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:49.960
it's got an end in that ADA to tell the person who's reading it oh this is a subject bro okay look at the one

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:55.200
underneath that genitive Ace what happens when you add Ace and make it

01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.640
means of the Soul it's possessive of the soul

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:08.200
the purpose of the soul is blah blah blah the purpose of the Soul then it's

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:15.640
got to be it's got to end with that ADA Sigma what about the dative it's an ADA with a

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:21.319
little tiny eoda everybody see a little tiny eoda subscript what's an ioda

01:07:21.319 --> 01:07:27.240
subscript an ioda subscript is a tiny miniaturized Yoda that you place

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:33.520
underneath the vowel and that's a dative I told you

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:40.839
that's the indirect object dative indirect object how do we translate that in Greek to for or with you're G to

01:07:40.839 --> 01:07:45.680
start with those to for or with to the

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:54.520
soul for the soul with the soul how did you do that I It With My

01:07:54.520 --> 01:08:02.079
Soul all they have to say is with that ending and the person knows oh this is an

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:08.319
indirect object this is this is something that it can be an

01:08:08.319 --> 01:08:14.200
instrument wow fantastic how'd you do it I did it with my soul and then finally

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:19.758
the accusative look at the accusative a look at the accusative a you see the a a

01:08:19.759 --> 01:08:26.400
new after the accusative when you attach that to the word p and become

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:34.640
you what does that mean it means that's being acted on by the verb I eat the

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:40.278
spaghetti I got to put spaghetti in the accusative case because it is being

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:46.600
accused it's being acted upon by the verb I kick the ball the ball was in the

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:53.520
accusative case I love my soul oh that sounds so do that sound creepy that

01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:01.359
sounds like something some what do you call those people to you walk around saying you got to love yourself I don't know hippies I don't

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:07.480
know go to the next one um look at this people um now here's the second de oh

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:14.080
wait go back go back in all fairness I'm sorry um I just did the singular I want you to notice it says underneath it it

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:20.798
says nominative plural right so then you're going to have to add the alpha e Yoda if you want to say Souls as the

01:09:20.799 --> 01:09:26.120
subject Souls do something you got to add Alpha eota suai

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:34.600
so I forgot to tell you with nouns we've got a singular form and a plural form dog singular dogs plural look what we do

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:42.359
in English we add an S English is a lightly inflected language our um our

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:47.440
nouns are going to be lightly declined right we've got a oh look what we got

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:53.080
we've got dogs we add an S and all of a sudden it's plural right well the Greek

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:58.800
has its own plural endings right you'll see them there okay I want you to um I

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:04.360
want you to be satisfied with that go to the next one go to the next one what do you need to know from this this is the

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:09.560
take-home replay this back to yourself here are second declension nouns and

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:16.920
look at their endings they're different from the first eion and most of these are masculine or

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:23.239
neuter masculine or neuter um typical word second e clinin

01:10:23.239 --> 01:10:31.480
word that you get in your vocabulary is on anthropos the word for human we get anthropology from it right human a human

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:38.960
in the nominative case is an anthropos but when we switch to the genitive case and we want to say of the human we say

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:44.600
anthropo and our accent changes position anop now you don't have to

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:50.000
worry about don't worry about accents right now I know people fret over accents and I'm going to tell you

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.960
exactly what they told me at California Berkeley when I took the Intensive course

01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:02.120
and for those of you who want to say oh that's political that says something political you morons I didn't I didn't

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:07.679
have more than five seconds to myself we went to school for eight hours a day

01:11:07.679 --> 01:11:12.840
came home and did four to six hours of work for the next day to prep for the

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:19.360
next day oh there was no politics I have Berkeley

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:24.719
is freaking awesome their Classics was freaking awesome um watch this people

01:11:24.719 --> 01:11:32.640
look at the ends here they're going to change and you're going to be able to look at those endings say oh okay this is how they're This Is How They relay a

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:39.040
case to me nominative genitive dative accus nominative gen dative accus hit me with the next one I just want you to see

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:45.280
the words written out we've only got one two more of these I want you to see the words written out look at this oh they

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:55.000
give you logos logos right right up front logos logos logu logo log on now

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.760
um these are just examples right of noun the next one is anthropos there it is anthropo right you can see how it

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:07.880
changes they're just going to walk you through how these words are going to change now what do you need to do you

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:15.600
need to do exactly what I needed to do you need to make mental slots for all of

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:22.120
these paradigms all of these ladders of endings that we go through you should

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:31.679
memorize them what are the feminine endings a a a a I own ice o that was

01:12:31.679 --> 01:12:41.280
both singular and plural I just gave you and I can do that in my sleep a a a i on

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:46.600
Ice you have to get to that point where you can just it becomes muscle memory

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:52.760
for you so these charts that I'm showing you I want you to

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:58.440
memorize those endings I want you to memorize the feminine of the first the

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:04.679
masculine and the neuter of the second okay masculine and neuter of the

01:13:04.679 --> 01:13:11.719
second give me the next chart give me the next chart finally what else does unit one

01:13:11.719 --> 01:13:18.560
give us it gives us the definite article this thing at the top in this box and you're going to notice oh look

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:25.560
it's got nominative it's it's also got cases nominative gen dative accusative singular and then underneath that

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:32.080
nominative genitive dative accusative plural right dog is subject dog is

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:37.719
possession dog as indirect object dog as direct object in the singular and then

01:13:37.719 --> 01:13:44.880
same thing in the plural now look at the feminine it's going to give you feminine forms and look at the neuter it's going

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:51.159
to give you neuter forms and you're going to notice look at the feminine for example it's an ADA you say wait a

01:13:51.159 --> 01:13:59.120
minute that's that just looks just like the the ending on the first declension nouns yes it does right look

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:07.080
at the genitive ace is the ending looks like just like the noun so you really aren't learning new forms here you have

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:13.760
to memorize this definite article I want you to do it in this way I want you to

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:19.719
take the masculine column and I want you to go right down I want you to take the feminine column and go right down neuter

01:14:19.719 --> 01:14:25.880
and go right down masculine right H to toon Hoon toy

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:30.920
to I want you to be able to do that you've got to be able to exercise some

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:37.360
of you will hate this and you'll say this is the worst part of Greek and there are a whole bunch of English boys

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:43.360
and girls who agree with you um from 100 years ago because what would those

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:49.080
English do in their classes all day uh um they would recite these

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:55.840
declensions they would recite the endings of verbs and you think what a waste of time no no no what you're doing

01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:02.080
is you're programming yourself to be able to function within this heavily

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:08.600
inflected language when I say inflected I mean the endings of words are going to

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:14.679
change that change will tell you what the word is doing you most of my

01:15:14.679 --> 01:15:22.040
audience okay if I'm talking to Modern Greeks or something never mind but most of you those of you who speak English as

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:29.679
a your primary language you're used to the word order right those Anglo Saxons were like oh God how do we how do we

01:15:29.679 --> 01:15:35.159
make life easy I know we'll put everything in order and the first thing I say has got to be the subject then

01:15:35.159 --> 01:15:42.239
you've got to say the verb then you've got to say the direct object right we'll do it by word order That's How we'll

01:15:42.239 --> 01:15:47.320
tell I ate the spaghetti I can't say the spaghetti ate

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:53.440
I because then I'm thinking about spaghetti eating someone because my stupid English brain is stuck in word

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:59.000
order and it's gonna affect everything you do from now on Greek does not use

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.920
word order think about that for a minute a ancient Greek passage can spit at you

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:11.560
50 words and you don't get the main verb until the end of the thing you don't really know what's going on until the

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:20.000
very end you're just juggling and stuff in your brain do you see what I mean in order to allow you to be able to juggle

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.560
this we've got to get the muscle memory we've got to get the mus muscle memory

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:32.880
down I need you to memorize the definite article okay what I'm going to do you take it down take it down show what I'm

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:41.080

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:46.520
ancient great class largest ever right we should be proud of this

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:53.400
and we should nurture this and get ourselves to the right place now listen to me if you need a pep talk if you're

01:16:53.400 --> 01:17:00.760
not doing this every every day if you're not taking this book that you've got if you're not looking at unit one for 30

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:06.040

you know at a restaurant when you're waiting for your beloved to show up um you can do it wherever you've got a few

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:25.840
extra minutes drinking a little bit read the vocabulary list and try to pronounce the vocabulary list from unit one over

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:31.199

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:45.440
as a final um kind of you know inspiration tonight um there

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:52.360
is um a place that I need to take you I need to take you to the gym and if you

01:17:52.360 --> 01:18:00.760
stop working out you're not going to make it you fall by the wayside the very um one of the very

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:09.520
earliest instructions that I remember from John Scarboro my advisor um was that if you stop it

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:15.600
leaks you can take a professor who's had 50 years of translation and if that

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:21.360
Professor stops for a couple of weeks he's he or she is going to leak they're

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:26.920
going to leak because it is not a Spoke language it is specifically a language

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:33.320
that we just translate unless you are actively working it you are losing what

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:39.239
you have built up you have to make constant progress and even if that is

01:18:39.239 --> 01:18:45.960
just 30 minutes a day 30 minutes a day imagine that if I told you I have a
