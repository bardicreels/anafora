00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:57.480
it divided it's divided between two types of people it's not

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:04.920
races it's not not any sort of physical attribute it's not a geographic location

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:11.959
it's not a tribe yeah you know how people are divided up at this time when cicus is

00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:19.800

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.919
aiding or a helping or an assistant look at the kinds of people if you look

00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:31.200
through those Greek terms you're going to find it's a lot of military stuff as a matter of fact it's kind of got a

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:36.600
military kind of theme to it okay give me the next one um this is militaristic

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:42.720
this is fantastic what else is Eve um the first part of what she is comes from

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:50.960
this word in Greek Boe and it's the loud cry look at the Dorian Bo right not bo

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:59.120
bo it's a shout right mostly a battlecry mostly a Battle Cry look look

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.279
sound of musical instruments the Roar of the sea oh I see so it's got a little

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:11.240
bit of range right just taste it taste it is you're trying to discover the

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:17.240
technical nature of Greek VOC ancient Greek vocabulary what you do is you

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:24.320
sample all the different Vineyards in the countryside you want to know what that region is good for sample them all

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:29.440
and that's what we're doing that's what those Brits those Victorian br britz

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.600
helped us to see what so important when you're performing classical

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:40.120
philology yes oh I love it so what we're doing is you you form a word from the

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:46.720
fine nuances that it takes on and pretty soon you can see the core you can see

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:54.200
the core okay so when you're reading one of these texts and some Greek is making up words right coining new words and

00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:00.640
those aren't in the Lexicon you can follow that dudette

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.520
path oh God 10th Muse baby order of the Rose don't you love it okay let's go we

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:12.080
got more drugs to sling here look at this people boa is hel or aid but look

talking about drugs yes fantastic fantastic assistance

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:32.200
how are drugs relevant there assistance they allow you to go from one place to

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:37.480
another from a place of weakness to a place of strength love it now if you

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:42.720

00:26:55.679 --> 00:27:01.080
it's a resource right right a remedy and that's

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:08.360
where I see it most is on the medical side right because they talk about these

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:16.240
things that you know plant substances animal substances that are these remedies right okay all right let's go

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:21.919
to the next one notice diores and hypocrates were both down there for you nerds who are into the medical side now

00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:27.919
wait this woman right what's she gonna be called what's she gonna be called she's gonna

00:27:27.919 --> 00:27:35.799
be called woman because she was taken from the

00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:41.279
man yeah because she was taken from the man now remember I know we talked about

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:48.799
this satanic congregation we talked about this but I want to re-emphasize it hit me with the next one we're gonna we're flying tonight sh um we talked

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:55.480
about the Weir AO remember in Hebrew it doesn't work we we can't call our

00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:03.159
woman taken from removed from the man when all it is in Hebrew is ish and Isa

00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:09.640
it's a masculine form for person and in a feminine form right that's it feminine

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:17.120
marker on the end that's it that's it okay so it doesn't work um the

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:25.679
problem is the Greek doesn't work either the Greek doesn't work either because it's goon and an right neither of those

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:33.760
are related or fulfill the the um taking from right the one taking from the Flesh

we have to put up with this is what ancient Greek does it allows you to

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:59.599
think in analogy it allows you to think as if everything down to the finest

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:07.960
material is analogous that there is an

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:14.240

sitting right there sitting right there with Mo sitting right there now why would

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:46.799
they do such a thing because as classical civilization was

00:51:46.799 --> 00:51:52.520
stifled by Christianity a pressure built in the

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:57.799
Dark Ages which is what I'll call period and

00:51:57.799 --> 00:52:04.200
little cracks developed in the fabric of life and through this crack came little

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:09.240
Springs of classical wisdom little Springs of it here and there Springs

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:15.040
that were untainted they were untainted by any sort of

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:22.680
monest judeo Christian Islamic philosophy or um anything

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:30.079
vocabulary anything no influence these are p pure classical streams this is the

00:52:30.079 --> 00:52:36.760
stuff that causes Renaissance Enlightenment this is the stuff that

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:44.799
causes democracy to be reborn that's what this stuff is oh my

00:52:44.799 --> 00:52:50.280

forgot yeah it's the hobbits

00:59:26.359 --> 00:59:31.520
what is it there are no such things as Hobbits do you understand something was

00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:36.960
going on kitis

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:45.280
baby did he just write did Dolan just write the kitis the the tragedy of the

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:51.760
kitis hobbits anywh who um what is the goodie

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:59.640
I'm gonna give you the seen of Helios is a drug um also um the seen of Jesus was

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:05.520
called the love of God isn't that

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:13.119
gross seriously isn't that gross right the love of God right it was

01:00:13.119 --> 01:00:18.760
so bad the Romans were resting them right because what do they do the

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:24.760
representative if it's not Jesus it's an apostle if it's not an apostle it's an

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:29.960
elder right it's if it's not an elder it's a

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.680
bishop right all through the first five centuries of Christianity what's going

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.960
on what's going on well when the Romans are in charge they're getting arrested

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:47.520
for taking orphan boys off the street and doing naughty things to them right

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:53.680
so it's a part of the right from the very beginning there's a reason that Jesus Christ was arrested in a public

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.640
park with a naked boy it's not just an accident it's not just a kid that was

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:05.200
like the the last Christian apologist I saw explain it Jesus walked by and let

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:12.039
off a glory bomb he was in a cemetery he had used the term you guys saw it Glory bomb and out comes the naked kid because

01:01:12.039 --> 01:01:17.599
he's crawling out of the Grave he's like a freaking zombie right now if you

01:01:17.599 --> 01:01:24.039
believe that I have a bridge for you to sell that kid was there for a reason and he was naked and he was with a medicated

01:01:24.039 --> 01:01:30.240
bandage but somebody wanted me to explain it to them today so I'm going to say it really straightforward because I

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:35.400
know that most of the congregation knows this right Jesus was arrested with a kid

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.520
in a public park right and that kid has a bandage he's naked and he's got a

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:50.079
medicated bandage wrapped around his penis Jesus is using the boy as the

01:01:50.079 --> 01:01:57.160
cop yes and so that medicine from that bandage and the kids fluids are being

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:03.079
used it's what's covering his face right they're like ew what's the stuff on your

01:02:03.079 --> 01:02:09.839
face well it's because they're getting the antidote right that kid is becoming the

01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:16.160
antidote and I asked the toxinologists um what is the you know what's the deal

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:23.559
why can you use castrated boys or um um prepubescent girls whose breasts have

01:02:23.559 --> 01:02:29.160
been treated with drugs can you believe this I found this in Galen yeah talking

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:36.279
about the small grapelike breasts of the virgins what do you do what do you paint

01:02:36.279 --> 01:02:43.079
their breasts with what

01:02:43.079 --> 01:02:50.000
right the level of tech that we have lost is phenomenal it's phenomenal and

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.359
it's because of our language people we're in the mess we are because our languages suck they suck

01:02:56.359 --> 01:03:03.480
Give me the give me the um the the rest of the hymn let's read the rest of this hymn right um what is she doing she

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:10.240
comes to us are you ready she comes to us this all Queen she comes to us

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:17.160
in the third time this is really hard to translate it literally is the third

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:23.160
times right so here's how the UN are you ready for some Quantum craziness here's

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:31.799
how the universe work works it's in cycle right and those Cycles are two on one

01:03:31.799 --> 01:03:37.400
off repetitively yeah so time

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:42.720
itself Kronos is linked to this

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:48.960
cycle two on one off

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:55.200
simil comes in the off time the third time

01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.319
they call it onethird time again I don't plan I don't I don't claim to understand

01:04:00.319 --> 01:04:09.599
this I don't know how it works I don't know how it works I don't know what the physics are of this but this is the

01:04:09.599 --> 01:04:17.200
Salvation of the mystery is in this onethird time okay

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:22.319
give me the hymn one more I'm gonna read it and then boom and then what what does

01:04:22.319 --> 01:04:27.839
she say um this is why they're going to celebrate bakus right because of this

01:04:27.839 --> 01:04:35.119
birth you thought the Virgin birth was one aspect and sometimes maybe somebody said why is it so important when I was a

01:04:35.119 --> 01:04:41.160
young Baptist I can remember think why is it so important the Catholics that old virgin birth thing every time I read

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:46.799
about the spirit of the Lord coming upon this virgin I thought oh so what

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:51.839
happened here I shouldn't be watching this right right dragons are blind baby

01:04:51.839 --> 01:04:58.319
we don't need to see that oh my god um right protect the Virgin hit it it's

01:04:58.319 --> 01:05:03.359
important because the mystery is that

01:05:03.359 --> 01:05:09.279
birth it is that birth and you say wait a minute I didn't see that coming you didn't see that coming when the

01:05:09.279 --> 01:05:14.960
culmination of Christianity is the marriage you didn't see that

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:21.200
coming oh my God amazing we need a whole room full of anthropologist we need to

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:27.119
drag them through these texts and just see what their teeth can pull out of the dirt oh give me the give me the bottom

01:05:27.119 --> 01:05:32.559
one finally why am I doing all this he says I'm praying to you I'm praying to

01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:39.559
you great cor wanasa and it uses that old Greek that old m in wanasa there's a

01:05:39.559 --> 01:05:45.599
diag on the front of that you can't see it that last word in the first line and what is he doing this all for to make

01:05:45.599 --> 01:05:53.599
her to be gentlem minded toward the

01:05:53.599 --> 01:06:00.720
initiates gentle minded is that glorious salvation is the gentlem

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:08.599
mindedness of the great virgin and she comes to purge now those

01:06:08.599 --> 01:06:15.920
are all of the signs that you need right those are the images with which you can

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:24.039
reconstruct the right we've got all the drugs put them together put them

01:06:24.039 --> 01:06:30.480
together yeah um please understand I want to say one final comment please and I know you're giving me too much time

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:37.440
please understand the first time that I saw that christing was

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:43.160
putting a substance into somebody's eyes to alter their mental state the first

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:51.000
time that I saw that I thought okay there's one rope through this cave

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.359
and I I only feel stable and comfortable with those drugs because they are a

01:06:56.359 --> 01:07:02.119
hardcore scientific element of all of this that I can just walk through the

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:07.960
right with I don't know why he's doing what he's doing I don't know why this Priestess is saying what she's saying I

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:13.720
don't understand how she can see the future and why the universe has this

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:20.079
threefold Matrix that it swims within I don't get repeating time I don't

01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:26.799
understand any of that stuff but what I do get is that the drug

01:07:26.799 --> 01:07:33.920
these are just plants and animal things you know what I mean these are um these are things that can make sense that can

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:39.279
make sense so I'm going to keep my mind on those and next time now I did have

01:07:39.279 --> 01:07:47.559
one reference for you I wanted to bring but I couldn't um because I can't I'm not comfortable with um my translation

01:07:47.559 --> 01:07:56.599
because technically I mean literally it says um this is the medicine that you use on those boys who have been reaped

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:06.559
and it's kind of a it's kind of a different way that I've seen it um for castration right um yeah okay so um I

01:08:06.559 --> 01:08:15.720
was going to bring you another castrated boy tonight but instead I've got a priestess who is um prepubertal who is

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:22.199
having her growth um guided chemically and here we have the formula

01:08:22.199 --> 01:08:28.120
for you and by the way these tablets they're made of oh God please come come

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:34.080
tomorrow we're going to talk about the actual drugs that they were using to

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:40.560
create this uh great great mystery for us to allow us to enter into that death

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:45.640
