financial marketing genius that's for sure do you know what that is it is a

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:12.760
reflection of the death of classical wisdom it's a reflection do you hear how

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.440
the atheistic world and when I say that I mean the monists because the monists

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.479
create atheism the monists create

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:34.840
atheism this gent is sucked into the monest atheistic

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.360
universe so what is their morality what do you think their morality is in that

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.520
Universe the man's kitchen the man's kitchen is not a

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.919
that's not that's not a man of wealth listen to Antiquity Mr HooHa

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:04.160
listen to Antiquity who is the wisest oh Oracle who is the

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.400
wisest Socrates is the wisest Socrates you know why

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.800
because he knew he didn't know and he knew other people who said they knew

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.360
were full of it and he could just tear you apart in a conversation and for that

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.759
the Oracle declared him to be the wisest of all wisest of all those people do you

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:35.600
see classical morality your greed stains your soul

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.840
with a stench of Ruin do you know where that gentleman is that gentleman is in

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:50.199
Hell being punished for his greed give me the next one Socrates had

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:56.240
one cloak baby do you know why Socrates had one

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.680
cloak because he didn't care what you thought about

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:09.560
him he listened to his Dione he listened to his Dione give me the next one these

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:17.319
are funny this dude is the biggest sop ever I'm a sop now and I think he's been

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:23.240
drinking a lot of drugs from the seriously

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.039
seriously sop sop this dude is the biggest sop

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.400
ever bro if you think that this has the

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.759
capacity to carry out any sort of sophisticated operation that involves I

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:46.120
don't know things like planning no no bro you're in the wrong

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:53.479
place give me the next one finally let's hear some sense from

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:59.319
Leo is that Leo we just say Leo if you listen to the four three now what is

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:07.000
this this is a note that was left you know this is a message that's left on an

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.039
interview on a no it was a review somebody did a review of Lady

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:18.879
Babylon right and this was one of the comments that they left if you listen to the full three in a bit Hour podcast it

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:25.240
gives one a drastically different portrait of the man well that's odd you

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.240
think that they you didn't see you only saw through their clip didn't you right

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:39.039
and it gave you a kind of a distorted view that's okay thank you for saying it I don't know if what he says is true or

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:44.520
not right he knows a whole a he knows a whole lot more about it than most people

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:51.599
okay thank you that's nice but you know what I'm said it could all be absolute nonsense but those were three of the

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:57.120
most far out and fascinating hours I've gotten from a podcast in

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:03.159
years I want to show you a couple of clips now and I want you to sit with me

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:12.840
and the Watchers and I want you to see the athe the atheistic monest soup in which

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:19.479
you live are you ready it's Topsy Turvy let's go for it jwy give me the first one what I what I

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:24.879
think that I got very confused by is um that I confused is the wrong word I am

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:30.759
skeptical okay of Lady babylon's ability to translate anything

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:36.080
he does have his PhD okay that doesn't mean anything I agree he he claims that

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:42.479
he can read another language that does not make you a good translator I'm pretty sure that he's just making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up it's like those little games where

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:48.240
you know like you're like okay make this letter be this letter I think he's just saying okay this word means this

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:54.920
now okay so that's what she thinks that's what she

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:01.000
thinks um you know what's funny is when you see

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.680
people who come with a preformed conclusion already they just have

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:12.160
something there they have some kind of now is this I just ask yourself is this

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:19.279
person who's talking any sort of Samurai is there a reason they're putting down

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:27.120
this other Samurai maybe they're I don't know maybe they're in linguistics maybe they're in Classics do you know people

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:33.000
have been asking and vetting amen and do you know what they're

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.079
finding they're finding hail Satan that's what they're finding they're

00:09:38.079 --> 00:09:45.959
finding that I'm just a classicist and I'm just doing what classicists do yeah

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:54.519
yeah it's no there's no trick there's no no it's just translation of those texts now this person doesn't even know

00:09:54.519 --> 00:10:00.959
doesn't even know the discipline and yet is willing to come out with a general

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:08.640
statement and say okay let's hear some more let's hear some more did you see by the way how quickly the gentleman turned

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.720
around when he said he does have a PhD and she was like that doesn't mean [Laughter]

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.959
anything you're right you're right Miss tight boox and that's her name in all

00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:27.519
fairness you're right you're right what I did was 12 years of University that

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:33.600
brought me three degrees in Greek ancient Greek classical

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:42.600
philology that's what I did and ever since then I've been reading it that's who I am that's where I

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:49.160
am so hit the next clip let's see what watch the world people and what they do

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:55.639
go you know what I have to say this right now especially for the people who are listening to the podcast you're right he's an idiot no genius would have

00:10:55.639 --> 00:11:00.959
a kitchen like that that is so dating that looks like King Cobra JF has that's

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:06.639
not a nice place and he has this Shrine that includes his riding cop which he as

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:12.600
you just heard is about to grab um and again for the people who are only listening he's about to use it to thwack

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:18.720
the floor a whole bunch he's it's he's a mental patient I heard you

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:25.040
single this man is crazy mommy pass me the chicken

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.200
nuggets no sauce I'm getting married again and he's the first guy I'm killing

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:35.560
yeah all right all right so you see you

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:42.160
see where the level of penetration is right you see where the level of

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.360
Engagement is where people can engage you're dealing with people who can only

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.399
engage on the surface to start with right and they're not here because they

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:59.000
want to be they're here because they're trying to work their way up the ladder right and they're going to critique this

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.600
person person without considering anything background any sort of but

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.720
that's okay we don't need them you know why because people can do those kind of

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:15.480
things and they have done them they love to do them in the Dark Ages Miss tyght

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:22.839
boox Miss tyght boox do you know what you did wrong miss typ

boox you mess with somebody who's well trained you mess with somebody who knows

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:35.040
the art and just to put your brain at

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.440
these um there's really not a difference between reading and translating because

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.880
you're doing the same thing okay I don't sit around and talk

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:53.480
to the U right I don't do that I don't change things from one language to

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:59.199
another I jump into the pit of the creek and I swim as deep as I can that's

00:12:59.199 --> 00:13:07.199
that's what I do that's my thing does it matter that my kitchen does my kitchen not impress you

00:13:07.199 --> 00:13:14.839

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:20.680
society that is no longer but Guided by

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:27.639
polytheism when you step away from Justice when you step away from those

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:35.480
values that make make you a woman when you step away from that

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:44.199
Hunter what happens to you you become concerned about kitchens do you know

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:52.120
well I'm going to say something to half of you half of you out there you are a mere

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.959
reflection just the shade of the great women who came before

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:12.120
to become that vampire oh God oh God

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:18.720
let's take a trip tonight again let's take a trip and look at a text I'm going

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:24.759
to flash up the one text up here I'm going to give you one

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:32.079
text and it's going to guide everything tonight are you ready this is the mystery what is going on here we're

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:37.399
talking about the death of Judas bring him up chewy we're talking about the

00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:43.759
death of Judas or what has been believed to be the death of

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:50.839
Judas this is the crime scene and who is our witness our witness is

00:14:50.839 --> 00:14:59.399
Peter and he is saying after Jesus in his vampire form was taken back up into

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:07.480
the uranos which is where they all go right after he was taken up Peter and his

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:14.160
Gang This gang of teenage cultists had to

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:21.320
perpetuate the right so they needed because Judas had had betrayed and so

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:32.199
what happen this is you know this a little bit later right and what are we doing we're forming a another mystery 12

00:15:32.199 --> 00:15:38.440
just like Paul does just like Jesus does just like anybody does who's following

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:46.040
ionic life whether it's your synagogues that have Ion with the Zodiac around him

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:52.440
or whether it's your Christians talking about ionic life you need those

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:58.480
12 you need those 12 so what they do they appointed another kid to be

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.519
involved D yeah another young person to be

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:11.920
involved and what happened to Judas and all of this well there are two accounts

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:18.120
here's part of the mystery are you ready I'm prepping you we're going into this crime scene and I want you to figure out

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:25.120
how what happened okay in this one verse it's all we're just looking at one verse I want

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:30.920
you to figure out what actually happened we have two accounts one in Matthew and

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:36.160
one of the in the Acts of the Apostles the first one in Matthew is

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.959
totally different it's totally different from the other one and the other one the

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:47.399
one in Acts we never you will never see this thing depicted in art anywhere as a

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:52.680
matter of fact chewy is reaching into that quantum singularity and pulling out

00:16:52.680 --> 00:17:01.319
the very first images the very first images of what is actually going on in

00:17:01.319 --> 00:17:06.480
this verse go ahead and throw that verse up there let's throw it up there boom

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.000
here it is

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:22.480
act8 what did Judas do he bought a piece of land isn't that nice he's an

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.720
entrepreneur he's an entrepreneur he bought himself a piece of land from what

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:34.360
from the Wade of his Injustice right for turning in Jesus he

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:41.640
got that now we're going to get a phrase that are a whole goal here tonight is to try to translate what happened what

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.240
happened to

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.989
[Music]

00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:02.000
Judas all right now I know you're running to the end there and you saw the splan now and you said wait a minute

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.440
wait a minute this is associated with the boys and theocritus this is why they chase boys they talk about it these are

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:16.440
the goodies the goodies the boys give how do you think we tell all of this

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:23.120
haruspicy all of this reading of the signs we do it from this power

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.320
now what does the English and everybody asked this question they've been asking

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:36.200
this that's not everybody that's an exaggeration people ask me this question why you why are you giving us the

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:42.320
reality and why haven't people before you right why haven't they come up and

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.880
done it and my answer is because of the weakness of classical philology that

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:55.159
classical philologists haven't been studying medical or scientific documents for ages and all they needed to do was

00:18:55.159 --> 00:19:01.320
look into the pharmaceutical side and they didn't and I did and I'm happy to

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:07.840
have done that and I'm bringing that to you now what is look at these translations of this verse before I

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.840
translate it for you which we're gonna do I want you to see what the English is

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:19.600
are you ready get your fantasy caps on with the payment he received for his

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.919

burst open and all his intestines Spilled Out wait a

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.280
minute what first of all that Greek does not

say anything about falling there is no falling there yeah it doesn't doesn't say I'm

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:49.520

reading the inherent word of God and you come across this

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.880
translation please please explain to me what this means Judas bought a field

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:21.080
with the money he received for his treachery falling head first there his

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:26.440
body split open spilling out his intestines wait now this man acquired a

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:32.640
field yeah yeah yeah and falling head he burst open there's going to be a lot of falling head long do you know why

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.760
translations different translations are so similar it's because Christian

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:45.559
translators are weak because they don't read anything but they're garbage and by

00:20:45.559 --> 00:20:51.559
garbage everybody's got garbage right everybody's got it they're

00:20:51.559 --> 00:20:57.960
not reading anybody else's how are you going to strengthen your understanding of the language if

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:05.000
all you read is the newspaper from 1980 seriously what are you going to

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.600
do oh my god um give me the King James let's see what the King James does now

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:18.279
this man purchased the field with the reward of iniquity that sounds more ominous and falling headlong he burst

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:25.799
theunder in the midst he he burst his belly in his

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:34.120
midsection he burst that open right okay okay now how are we going to

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:43.279
figure out what is actually going on right are you ready I'm going to reveal it for all the Catholics and all the

00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:51.320
Evangelical all the charismatics right you're going to get to see what this is actually doing and how do we do that we

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:58.279
do it from the Greek that's all we do it from the Greek Give me the give me the first one look at this people having

00:21:58.279 --> 00:22:04.000
said that here's some Latin look at this you know what this

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.400
says um it's part of a quote it's only part but it's part of a quote that says

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:15.480
magic Right comes from medicine right why would they say magic

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:20.880
came from medicine this is plenty why would they say this in Antiquity because of the

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.960
drugs right drugs are a part of medicine but they are also the driver of

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.880
magic yeah so um to them it's you know he says Nemo

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:41.120
doit nobody will doubt right like everybody knows give me the next one um

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.640
just a couple of more I wanted to give you um look at the first word here

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:53.159
buim bu Prest now you were talking about Judas I know and now I'm talking about

00:22:53.159 --> 00:22:58.840
buprestis what is that it's a beetle

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:05.679
it's a beetle a a beetle that in Antiquity they said it's a little bit

00:23:05.679 --> 00:23:12.640
different from but it's in the same group does the same thing as

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:19.200
cantharides cantharides what is canares that's one of the blister beetles that

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.600
produces a little resin and you can you know what it does that resin is a love

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:30.760
gift it's a love gift the um it's given to protect the eggs the female will

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:36.880
receive it and then protect the eggs with it uh but it's quite toxic and um

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:43.000
why am I mentioning basus go back to the beginning go back to that quote with basus

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.320
please so he says the Greeks talk about it in a couple of

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:53.480
different ways they say first of all it's good just for consumption of your

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:59.240
for your diet's sake right and otherwise they talk about it like it's a you got

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:05.320
to use remedies against the drug with it right that this is the you know really

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:11.320
poisonous and toxic stuff right and even its name indicates that you know it's a

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:18.000
poison right because what happens when the cows that's where the boo comes from

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.799
when the cows eat it they dis they disate what does that mean it

00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:31.840
means they explode it means they

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:38.159
explode they vent you've heard of the

00:24:38.399 --> 00:24:46.480
word um deiss when you have a when you have a surgery and you've been cut open you

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:52.120
don't want that closed tissue to open up

00:24:52.120 --> 00:25:02.640
again this is what they're trying to prevent is that opening of the tissue right what happens there is a

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.200
bursting there is a bursting with the cattle

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.760
now um I used to work on a dairy I didn't see any cattle burst I did see

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:19.960
some die from bloat I did see some die from bloat and I know that's a

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:25.559
possibility but that is not what this author is talking about and when when a

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:33.159
cow Dice from blow they don't explode anyway right this is what happens his splankna

00:25:33.159 --> 00:25:38.960
spill out of his body his goodies spill out of his body

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:45.679
okay let's go to the next one I think they see where this is this is going um people I want you to meet really quick

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:51.760
here the here theat look at the

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.880
Greek what is this this is the art of healing with ointments you didn't even know this existed did you right you

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:04.159
didn't even know it existed you know when we talk about christing we're talking about using ointments and when I

00:26:04.159 --> 00:26:09.240
say ointments I mean really crazy drug ointments let's

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:15.440
see let's see some crazy drug ointments you know I know you guys love the crazy

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:21.000
look at the also look at the iatra Maya is a feminine physician right or

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.039
Midwife isn't that nice so for those of you think oh women didn't do anything yeah no they were no they were

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:33.159
met listen love it give me the next one give

00:26:33.159 --> 00:26:40.000
me the next one thec says plenty is the name given to a preparation devised by

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.760
luxury a composition formed of 600 different ingredients and this while Nature has bestowed upon us such numbers

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:54.520
of Remedies Each of which would have fully answered the purpose employed by itself the Mythic antidote is composed

00:26:54.520 --> 00:27:00.159
of four in 50 ingredients now listen to this 54

00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:07.159
ingredients none of which are used in exactly the same proportion and the quantity prescribed

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:14.880
is in some cases so small as the 60th part of one

00:27:14.919 --> 00:27:22.799
Denarius right we're in the world of grams now we're talking about Antiquity and

00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:28.279
the complex compound drugs that they're using in mystery rights and the

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:33.799
measurements are that precise you know where they're getting

00:27:33.799 --> 00:27:41.159
that Precision that's Bronze Age late Bron's age Precision with pharmacology this is why when somebody

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:47.960
comes on and they say I don't like his kitchen right you know that there are

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:54.159
certain people out there that you can show that reality to you can give it to

00:27:54.159 --> 00:28:02.039
them and they'll say thank you right there are other people who already have a preformed

00:28:02.039 --> 00:28:08.880
notion right you can stand them in front of the mirror this is bakic

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:16.080
initiation this is bakic ini initiation people are forced to look

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:21.880
into the mirror look at what Miss typ boox did

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:28.320
tonight right she talked about things she had no clue no knowledge of

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:33.480
whatsoever and dismissed it entirely dismiss just just just

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:41.080
dismissed that's the same thing the leaders of the theology schools do it's

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:49.080
the same thing that Jordan Peterson does right they come from outside the

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:55.399
field right and condemn and just deny every just deny everything can't be look

00:28:55.399 --> 00:29:00.720
at his kitchen right look at his kitchen do you see why Socrates was walking

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:06.399
around like he was and why the the Oracle was saying he was the wisest

00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:12.159
Athenian who walked around saying these people don't know what they're doing you

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:17.279
don't know what Justice is you don't know what Justice is all you have to do

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:22.679
is look at your ba basic definitions everything you think is

00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:30.480
right will be turned on its head and you'll see just from the scientific breakdown of your own stupid Thoughts by

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:36.480
the power of reason you're an idiot and if you haven't come to that

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:43.840
place yet you end up you know you end up saying look at the man's kitchen here's

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:49.840
my kitching of that right if that's your level if that's your level of depth

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:58.679
right but the ancient Mysteries and the women who made them the oracles who perpetuated them

00:29:58.679 --> 00:30:06.120
you do them a great disservice miss typ boox you do them a great

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:13.120
disservice yeah and they're watching you they're watching you fantastic let's go

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.679
to the next one right let's go to the next one that was not very cheery look

00:30:18.679 --> 00:30:25.360
let's get down to here do this one real quick do this one look people what bug are we talking about we're talking about

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:31.480
Spanish Fly Right the term Spanish Fly thank you Alan the term Spanish Fly is

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:38.000
refer to various aphrodisiacs oh I forgot to tell you this is their big

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.279
aphrodesiac like the cantha days the blister beetle right they produce that

00:30:44.279 --> 00:30:51.360
chemical what does it do let's see however the real Spanish Fly contains a hazardous substance that can blister

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:58.440
your skin right and it can kill you too are you ready give me the next one Watch What Happens Remember by the way

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.519
by the way plenty was talking about how specific the amounts are that they're

00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:10.279
working with right because they know why do they have to be that specific because they know if they give too much they'll

00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:15.399
kill you watch what happens where does it come from True Spanish Fly is made

00:31:15.399 --> 00:31:20.519
from blister beetles specifically the substance produced by the B beetles is called

00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:28.480
cantharidin John Scarboro wrote about cantharidin and what it does and how it interacts with prostate the insect's

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:34.679
name is not for nothing contact with cantharidin blisters the

00:31:34.679 --> 00:31:39.840
skin now you know why they call it the burning

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:46.480
purple guess what this drug is one of the ones they use for cancer treatment external cancer

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:52.440
treatment okay contact with canar and blister skin

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:57.919
it use its use dates way back and some of its many Infamous fans include a

00:31:57.919 --> 00:32:04.840
Roman Empress who used canaran to encourage sexual behavior worthy of blackmailing your family that's nice

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:10.559
Roman gladiators using it for orgies wasn't just Gladiators Queens who used

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:16.639
it on their kings and those kings on their Mistresses right now he says to spice

00:32:16.639 --> 00:32:22.799
things up but watch what's happening this is not intentional dried beetles

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:28.480
would be crushed and mixed with drinks or sweets not always to the receiver's knowledge

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.799
what do you think Cersei was putting on those pigs

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:38.840
food right putting the blister beetle you know you can kill someone like that

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:44.919
right yeah and every once in a while they do they do when media went to the

00:32:44.919 --> 00:32:50.639
Temple of Hera to dedicate her children couple of them didn't make it through

00:32:50.639 --> 00:32:57.880
the process those children were dedicated to Hera okay they're working with very Dam

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:03.320
dangerous chemicals very dangerous and not only that he talks about fumigating

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:08.559
this one I don't know how that would change it I don't know what that would do but it gets crazy okay give me the

00:33:08.559 --> 00:33:16.600
next one after that one yeah along with longlasting erection Spanish Fly was found to cause a number of serious side

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:22.519
effects including death so if we had a commercial for Spanish Fly today we

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:28.320
would have to have somebody read you know this includes serious side effects including death right

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:36.600
even death as the Marquee dead tragically discovered in 1772 after giving sweet an a seed balls

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:44.279
laced with Spanish fly to prostitutes why would he be giving

00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:50.639
Spanish fly to the prostitutes because as anyone knew in Antiquity especially

00:33:50.639 --> 00:33:58.240
the women who were involved with the Midwifery there is a way to make make a

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:04.399
woman's body heated there is a way to fill your

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:09.839
heated Center and to cause you to burst into

00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:14.919
flames yes I saw this done once in an interview I saw it done once in an

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:20.878
interview the photographer was surprised spontaneous combustion right on the spot

00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:30.040
right on the spot it was fantastic um love it um this is the power of the drug

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:37.358
this is the power of the drug that they're talking about okay a power to force

00:34:37.359 --> 00:34:44.079
you to be brought to a place of

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:49.158
climactic perfection yeah yeah and it all starts

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:55.560
they say with your heat right it all starts with your heat and how that heat

00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:02.760
can be focused and where it can be Fus focused and the drug does just that it

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:08.359
takes it to the part of your body now what does it do in men it just happens

00:35:08.359 --> 00:35:16.359
to have now right this W this drug is first for a woman this is not a man's drug but when you give it to men you get

00:35:16.359 --> 00:35:22.440
saders you get saders give me the next give me the next

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:27.839
um look at look at what are the symptoms that we get here painful urination

00:35:27.839 --> 00:35:32.960
for urination right when you're in a psychotic fit that's no fun blood in

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:39.839
your urine vomiting blood you're going to get the clue here there's a lot of blood coming out of different places

difficulty swallowing seriously you difficulty are you kidding I've got blood coming out of places I don't care

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:52.800
how hard it is priapism fancy talk this author said for persistent painful

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:59.160
erections right they also call it sarasus they have numerous words for it

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:06.480
because it's a common drug activity you can cause this person to have a painful

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:13.119
unring erection causes abdominal pain eventually kidney failure some

00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:19.040
gastrointestinal bleeding you get a lot of bleeding out the anus with it a lot

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:24.599
of bleeding out the anus and then some neurological you know as you as you

00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:30.359
shoot down the as you shoot down the uh slide of death go ahead and put some of

00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:36.000
our pictures up there as you shoot down the slide of death eventually it takes

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.800
tastes your nervous tissue and turns it into not good um it kills you and how

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:51.000
does it kill [Music] you causes you to shed that essential

life that flows

00:36:56.079 --> 00:37:01.599
from that body under the influence of the

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:05.480
you're going to understand your hard drive you're going to understand what's happening that is what they're

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:12.359
performing now what are they doing that with they're one of the components are these blister beetles give me the next

00:38:12.359 --> 00:38:20.839
one oh you know what go back to that go back to that plenty one yeah that big one yeah okay I I wanted you to see here

00:38:20.839 --> 00:38:26.200
I wanted you to see here that plenty's like look there's you know these people

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:31.599
are just bragging because it's impossible to get those tiny tiny amounts of measurements right he's so

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:39.560
amazed at how the level of the science is reached in Pharmacology right we have accounts of

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:46.680
people doctors who accidentally overdose patients we have a accounts of it and

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:52.400
it's not pretty but it's happening it's happening right there's no FDA there

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:58.040
there's no regulations there right

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:04.920
yeah give me the next one give me the next one watch this as to the other remedial virtues attributed to bugs

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:11.079
because you think what we're dealing with bugs for the Cure of vomiting that's nice look people you can use bugs

00:39:11.079 --> 00:39:16.240
to stop vomiting courtin fevers now people don't know what Cordon fever here

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:23.480
is but it's a malaria yeah it's a type of malaria they're they have chronic fevers

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:29.760
populations of chronic fevers and they noticed hey there's a there's a um

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.800
there's a relation here between how many of us have fevers and how many of these

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:41.599
swamps we're cleaning up right getting rid of all this malaria this bad air

00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:47.520
that means bad air right so you see the whole the kind of the the big picture

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:54.880
look the holistic look that they've got of the of the world around them you're part of a system you're part of a system

00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:00.359
and you are balanced within that system and we can give you drugs to bring you

00:40:00.359 --> 00:40:06.800
to places that you can't be brought otherwise Watch What Happens and other diseases allthough we find what do we

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.319
use bugs to treat um I look upon them as utterly

00:40:12.319 --> 00:40:18.640
unfounded and not worthy of further notice they are employed however for the treatment of lethargy there we go

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:23.800
lethargy that's interesting you want a little pck me up drink some Buck juice

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:29.200
and with some Fair reason as they successfully n neutralize the narcotic

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:36.359
effects of the poison of the ASP what what so wait a minute this is not

00:40:36.359 --> 00:40:44.520
some dude who's just walking along gets bitten by an asp this is a dude who is using the ASP and he's countering that

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:52.319
ASP with this anti-narcotic with this antin

00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:59.800
narcotic do you see how sophisticated the the plant Flor and fauna Bridge was

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:06.359
with these people and it's coming through the Greek it's not coming through the Latin I'm giv you a Latin Source but it's coming through the Greek

00:41:06.359 --> 00:41:12.880
from the Viper are prepared right nobody ever believes me when I say these things so here they are in the their words from

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:20.359
the Viper are prepared those tablets which are known as thec right to the Greeks okay again who we talking about

00:41:20.359 --> 00:41:25.839
just plenty just plenty he's just given us the Encyclopedia of the day right

00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:32.920
he's Mr encyclopedia he's going to talk about magic and medicine he's going to talk about drugs and God he goes on and

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:40.160
on and on give me the next one give me the next one a pounded scorpion this is just for

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.200
fun for those of you who want something fun to think about a pounded scorpion

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:50.760
it's got to be pounded right this thing can't be drowned and then peppered you

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:57.200
know it's got to be pounded and it neutralizes the Venom of a spotted lizard I don't even know what

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:03.440
what kind of spot of L that is and most of these texts you'll look at the notes in them and they'll say we don't know

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:10.079
who this what what species this is it's probably this one right because it's in this region that he's describing and oh

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:15.480
yeah they have this spotted lizard right okay fine but you can use

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:23.880
the scorpion venom so now you understand why in the Mythic depictions of the God you've

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:29.520
always got like scorpion some kind of scorpions trying to things

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:36.319
testicles yeah you use the

00:42:36.319 --> 00:42:44.160
Venoms as compounds right you use them as compounds now remember when you have the

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:49.640
blister beetle on board and you are bleeding anally I want you just wait

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:55.640
you're bleeding anal Crimson blood this is not the black blood you get from in

00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:03.559
the intestine higher up this is that Crimson anal blood and that mixes with

00:43:03.559 --> 00:43:09.520
purple do you know what's happening that purple is getting

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:16.599
absorbed that purple is getting absorbed they're mixing in your own body they're

00:43:16.599 --> 00:43:25.720
mixing drugs is Christ is Christ a drug term

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:35.160
seriously people seriously I can I can't count I can't count the the references

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:40.559
of course it is and notice wait I want to say one I

00:43:40.559 --> 00:43:47.160
want to say one thing while we have Jesus and Company um notice that people

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:53.440
won't go back and actually look for themselves notice there's a

00:43:53.440 --> 00:44:00.280
fear that a palpable fear in looking at the original text there's a fear that

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:06.520
you may find something let's figure out what's going on with Judas here because you know we know we're in the cult we

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:12.119
know give me that next one there you go watch this people um here are the

00:44:12.119 --> 00:44:19.119
remedies that you can derive from cantharis you mean that blister beetle that gives me a terrible forceful

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:26.800
erection and makes my anus bleed right and different parts of my body bleed I'm G to come right get me the purple you

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:33.880
mean um those things can be used as remedies right yeah but with reference to canares

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:39.119
there's been considerable controversy on the subject seeing that taken internally

00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:47.960
there are poison attended with excruciating pains in the platter that's nice to know right um then it keeps

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:54.920
going I just wanted you to see that you can talk about remedies derived from these very same

00:44:54.920 --> 00:45:00.599
poisons right which they know are poison poisonous and canares are produced from

00:45:00.599 --> 00:45:05.720
small grub found most particularly in the spongy excrescences which grow on

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:11.960
the stem of the dog rows isn't that interesting why the dog rows why and still more abundantly on

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:18.240
the ash other kinds again are found upon the white rose look at how observant they are and this is just

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:25.240
plenty what is he doing he has a slave read to him all day long while he's

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:33.920
doing government business he has a slave follow him around and read to him when he's in the bath slave reading to him

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:40.319
and then he takes all that information and piles it into an encyclopedia that's what he's doing here so he it's not that

00:45:40.319 --> 00:45:45.640
he knows this right he's picked it up from another author and what does that tell you it tells you kitties you've

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:51.319
been lied to by these lying people sons

00:45:51.319 --> 00:45:58.160
of the people who told you nobody reads an Antiquity I heard somebody

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:07.880
septu agent expert quote unquote oh God nobody no nobody reads

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:15.200
Antiquity what are you talking about what are you talking about look at all the information that's slammed into this

the French surgeon Ambrose pel described a case in 1572 of a man suffering from

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:28.720
the most frightful Satur why is it frightful

trying to explain these are Victorian Scholars is trying to

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:34.359
explain how this word is being used in The Acts of the Apostles and they have

00:55:34.359 --> 00:55:41.280
to put in parentheses for perhaps this is from

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:47.240
PR becoming ex distended distended hit me with the next

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:54.359
one distended watch this people this word equals preo to blow up

00:55:54.359 --> 00:56:00.520
or distend and what kind of authors are using it to mean to blow up or distend

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:07.760
look at the end of the first line The Acts of the Apostles this is a different passage 286 you know what that means it

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:15.240
means this one author is using this term this way

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:20.880
consistently and who else is using it hypocrite hypocritic nature of women

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:29.520
hypoc hypocritic nature of women is the author of act using a medical term yep

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:36.119
and that author is using it repeatedly the same way okay give me the next

00:56:36.119 --> 00:56:45.599
one now um here is the verb from which it comes right pimp me pimp me all right

00:56:45.599 --> 00:56:51.680
and notice that it can mean to burn with fever can mean to burn the whole idea of

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:58.480
the burning and the swelling are combined they talk about Love Burns me I

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:03.559
can feel the love in my loins right when they say Can You Feel

00:57:03.559 --> 00:57:08.680
the Love Tonight they were talking about a burning sensation in your

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:15.079
genitalia right Can You Feel the Love Tonight It's the burning in classical

00:57:15.079 --> 00:57:21.440
Antiquity it's the burning Can You Feel The Burning you know what that burning attracts it attracts

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:28.839
moisture it attracts moisture what are we doing with the cantharus

00:57:28.839 --> 00:57:34.720
what are we doing with the canaris that Beetle that causes us to be able to come

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:41.720
to a forced climax while our anus

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:52.000
bleeds watch this give me the next one give me the next one where we were where we were buprestis animal look what he

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:58.400
says this is plenty buprestis is a you know kind of rare in Italy right and

00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:04.160
it's very similar to the Scarab and if it really escapes the cow's notice right

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:11.480
it falls in among the herbs and the cows eat it right and what happen when the cows eat it they become

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:17.480
inflamed they become surging and they

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:23.200
rot they burst they birst from that inner surge

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:28.440
why it's in the chemicals it's in the chemicals it's all that

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:35.440
interaction right and again I worked on a DA I'm going tell you for a fact I've never seen a cow explode and I've seen

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:40.720
many not many but a handful die of bloat right where they literally cannot give

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:46.599
off any more gas right and if they essentially just choke themselves right

00:58:46.599 --> 00:58:52.880
they just suffocate themselves there's no explosion right we're talking about

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:57.920
bringing the person to the place where they can spill their goodies are you

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:05.119
ready give me the next one are you ready oh God you mean Judas remember when Judas got angry oh we're going to see

00:59:05.119 --> 00:59:10.359
that in a minute okay look from the Viper they make a pastel right which

00:59:10.359 --> 00:59:15.640
they call a thec the Greeks called the thec right and the Greeks say that these

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:20.920
things are poisons right I just want you to see the Romans are well aware of the

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:28.880
capacity the Greeks have for using the thcs when the woman is Seated on the beach that Beast is that

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:34.240
thec give me the next one it's gorgeous I love it okay I know

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:39.280
people it's getting I thought I would go slower this is what you're doing you're

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:45.200
becoming prayes you're becoming

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:51.720
distended you mean Judas didn't just follow look he was at the sale right

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:57.720
Chey he was at the sale of the property and the real there was like

00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:05.039
congratulations you just bought your first hel and he was like ah and his guts exploded and just spilled out the

01:00:05.039 --> 01:00:10.440
front of them like an exorcist or something right concomitant with Jesus

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:16.319
on the cross now the author of Matthew knew right that he had to have a death

01:00:16.319 --> 01:00:21.799
scene this scene in Acts doesn't talk about doesn't say

01:00:21.799 --> 01:00:27.039
explicitly Judas died it doesn't strange ly

01:00:27.039 --> 01:00:32.400
enough strangely enough the Matthew scene does and in Matthew he's just he

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:38.400
feels bad right he's like a he doesn't buy a plot of land so we can party right

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:46.400
he he does what yeah he hangs himself right because he feels bad he feels bad this is not

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:51.559
the death scene there's no death here so what's

01:00:51.559 --> 01:00:56.640
happening he's swelling he's swelling and what happens after that he

01:05:40.079 --> 01:05:47.160
that we just looked at just like the one we just looked at do you know what he

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:53.839
was doing give me that last one do you know what he was doing

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:01.520
he was in that field blown up with the

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:08.640
buprestis bursting and spilling out his seed while our Lord Jesus Christ was

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:14.480
dying and Peter is the one who relates this tale

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:22.640
why because we all know he's dead what happened Peter were you a witness to it

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:29.279
no all we know is that he spilled everything that blood came out and

01:06:29.279 --> 01:06:36.240
that's all there was he was ODed you mean Judas is scariot and Jesus Christ

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:42.440
were both under the influence of drugs when they

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:49.799
died supposedly yes

01:06:49.799 --> 01:06:57.160
yes this is how the language works this is how you

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:03.640
Express that performance of the mystery and you don't see it because there is a

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:10.000
gulf between us and them and the only bridge in that Gulf is that thing that

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.039
you and I have in common blah blah blah right it's the only it's the only way we

01:07:16.039 --> 01:07:23.640
get there is through the language right when I tell people Jesus is saying I'm not a pet

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:28.880
harass I'm not a child oh I don't want to use that word I'm not a child

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:35.440
trafficker right I can pull up a text for you and I can show you in the

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:40.720
text and you can you know be convinced or

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:47.400
not but the fact is you are the people who want to take that trip you're

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:55.680
the people who want to look into that reality not the ones who want to say his kitchen look at his kitchen what a what

01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:03.960
a what a bunch of impoverishment I'm going to save that for next time I want to end with a quote I asked Dr Carl

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:09.240
Ruck I asked him give me a quote I've got a bunch of Greek students now and I

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:15.039
wanna I want to encourage them tell me as a classicist tell me something he

01:08:15.039 --> 01:08:22.080
said I consider ancient Greek the prototypical humanity right he just sent me me this

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:29.199
in his email I'm putting up there like it's a quote but he just emailed me this the language and the cultural fantasies

01:08:29.199 --> 01:08:35.120
encoded in its mythological Traditions have provided the nomenclature for many

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:40.719
of the well-known psychological paradigms for example the edus

01:08:40.719 --> 01:08:47.400
complex but the art and literature this is the part I like unlike the tormenting

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:55.560
delusions of psychosis are the products not of a diseased mind but the highest aspiration

01:08:55.560 --> 01:09:02.640

studying reading Greek he has a taste for it and a flavor he has an

01:09:21.799 --> 01:09:27.640
understanding of it that you cannot parallel um we should consider him we

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:32.679
should consider him a modern

01:09:32.679 --> 01:09:38.278
savior it's his knowledge it's that knowledge it's that ability to work with

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:43.400
