for serpent I'll just translate it to you this thing is a anti-farmicon it's a

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:18.480
drug combo that's paired with others and it's used for anything you're applying that serpent Venom to isn't that nice

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.179
they use it in the eyes for people who have problems seeing and it takes away a

00:22:24.179 --> 00:22:30.380
headache and for those who use it who are chronic users

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:38.460
those who were chronic users you know what happens to them they get better hearing

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:46.559
down to the point that they can hear just the very slightest conversation what this thing gives you super powers

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:52.740

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:15.780
well in medicine ancient medicine a kinetic is when you

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:20.299
have no movement in your skirt

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:28.380

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:34.799
and you know what happens when your skirt we're Mediterranean so we were skirts right don't

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:40.080

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.419
right um if your skirt has no movement

00:23:45.419 --> 00:23:52.799
this drug can make things work can make things work let's see let's see

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:57.960
the rest of that recipe for disaster here what are we giving to people who

are coming to concert tonight this is amazing yeah they're going to be able to

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.799
see better and hear better and the ones that are akinetic are going to be led to afrodisia

00:24:09.799 --> 00:24:15.000
afrodisia and even some you know maybe some lightheadedness too some

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:22.260
light-headedness um but all of this is coming to us through that episode me on right through

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:29.640
Kinesis the movement and the epithemia epidemion is desire it's sexual desire

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:36.120

this is just the okay dance or movement change Revolution

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:06.059
Kinesis you don't have any movement there's nothing dancing in your pants if

00:25:06.059 --> 00:25:15.720

00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:20.220
is that X EOS you can hear the X plus the EOS you can hear that poison did you

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:25.980

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:31.260
poison and to heal

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:36.720
poisoned and to heal and this is not one that people typically it doesn't sit in

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:44.099
several different ways in Greek because they have this concept they had this old pulaskian concept that filters in

00:38:44.099 --> 00:38:53.040
filters in through the medical side um yeah and uh they have a

00:38:53.040 --> 00:39:01.380
oh God once we're in the pain the etheriac will boost us to the place

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:09.240
that we can contain that passion that we can hold that passion and through that

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:14.280

Men junkies are using who are telling us the future and telling us where to set

00:40:54.300 --> 00:41:01.200
our set our colonies down and directing us to kill tyrants these people who are

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:06.839
running an Empire that stretches from Babylon all the way to the all the way

00:41:06.839 --> 00:41:14.760
to the west side of Europe yeah yeah these people these very same people

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:21.780
um let's go to one more text I'm hit I'm hitting it but I just wanted you to see Adam I'm going to throw this up there

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:27.839
for a little mystery because everybody likes mystery you guys like solving things and then telling me what the

00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:34.099
solutions are but I told you we were taking back Eve as she who is

00:41:34.099 --> 00:41:41.460
awazo right she who is the one entering the bakic worship she whose eyes are

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:46.820
being opened and Adam who is Adam who is Adam

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:56.480
Adam's that guy without whom you're never going to get to the second to last line odd omniv

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:03.839
how do they use Adamas how do you use atomas Adamas is hard

00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:10.079
Emos is hard how do you use atomas there's a few people here I could ask

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:16.079
and I know that those people would have very very good descriptions of what I

00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:23.160
what we could do with Autumn Moss um yes but it turns out in Antiquity

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:28.440
what do you do with Adam you perform Magic

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:35.460
which is why the sybils said Adam is north south east west

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:41.280
north south east west you mean the civils the pagan civils

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:49.080
um have Adam yes they do Adam is there before the proto-hebrew by 800 years

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:56.640
[Laughter] send Linear B yes isn't that gorgeous to heal and to

00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:03.839
kill all at the same time to heal and to kill with the technical these Greeks and

00:43:03.839 --> 00:43:09.260
their technical prowess oh my God what happened

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:15.480
what happened to that power that power ah gorgeous love it love it

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:21.660
and I think that's uh this is our last right we have a well go ahead and Flash that go ahead and Flash that up there

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:26.880
look I just want you to see a little um we'll go to this one first actually

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:32.400
um look at this this is the unconquerable all right Adam the Adama

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:38.040
oh the one that can't be overcome the one that can't be overcome isn't that

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:43.920
nice but if you go to them in Latin just for the fun of it it really just means to love

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:51.420
it really just means to love and is often shows us there at the bottom

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:58.859
um this is the kind of love take it off this is the kind of love that is unlawful this is the Allah for love

00:43:58.859 --> 00:44:04.319
the unlawful love um okay

00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:12.359
okay did they mean to get the weirago and the Septuagint because they stunk that in there the Greeks who wrote the

00:44:12.359 --> 00:44:18.660
Old Testament stuck it in there a reference to an old Etruscan term why

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:24.680
because these Greeks in Alexandria were both studying and emulating the same

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:32.460
junkies that you and I are researching now when Jesus is doing his thing in the

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:39.720
garden with the boy screaming I'm not a child trafficker when the authorities show up in the raid

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:45.420

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:52.859
a new world ex knee hello he is borrowing from a

00:44:52.859 --> 00:44:59.880
working tradition of mystery otherwise Jesus Christ would not have been

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:07.859
arrested in a public park at 4 00 am with a naked boy

00:45:07.859 --> 00:45:16.280
