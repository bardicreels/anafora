00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:54.320
is a helenistic poet by the way people right like the helenistic poet yeah the

00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:01.399
awkwardest idles talking about magic talking about bringing back your

00:29:01.399 --> 00:29:08.200

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:15.559
chewy one before this we got one star system ahead there there we go um and look what does he say here um about the

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:22.519
atmology right it actually is not preus he says it's

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:28.880
Brios sticks the diagma that oops Salon in there and what is this for

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:36.279
this is because they're referencing he says the Bic dance of

00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:42.799
intoxication that involves all the shouting the

00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:49.600

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:57.519
star system go to the next one boom um look here A A are you ready what does it

00:29:57.519 --> 00:30:04.760
mean it means some kind of roaring some kind of

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:12.840
vocalization right in the middle it can be to

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:20.320

that calls can you hear it I love it give go back to the one more time with

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:34.960
the text above that now people what does he say at the very bottom he says in priapus some people say Prius is comes

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:41.120
from Sperma uh oh when I said Sperma you probably got it what is it to project

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:48.519
the sperm to project the Sperma when you does everybody see what that moment is

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:55.240
of that Rush that that ye that shouting that

00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:01.919
vocalization that brings the fork the throwing out the injection into the

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:07.639
world of that Sperma because we all

00:31:07.639 --> 00:31:14.960

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:22.000

Farmers our universe is cultivation you know where religion comes from some people people have been

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:37.399
saying comes from the drugs no the drugs are a part of it but

00:31:37.399 --> 00:31:42.799

Aphrodite God okay you're almost there if you're that much closer to the

00:43:19.079 --> 00:43:25.599
upon an orgy right now it was fabricated in the 3 Century fabricated in the third

00:43:25.599 --> 00:43:31.720
Century let's go give me the next one give me the next one we're getting into it I want to give you some verses look

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:37.240
we're going to end on this we're going to end on this tonight I'm going to

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:43.119
bring you back to Creation what is written below is the Greek says in the

00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:53.400
beginning God made uranos and Gia uranos and Gia and Gaia was a oros

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:59.720
and now I'm just going to show you this is the passage that says the Earth

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:07.000
was AOS I'm gonna show you how this is a more technically advanced work than what

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:15.079
the Hebrew is that this cannot be a translation of Hebrew you cannot take a

00:44:15.079 --> 00:44:21.960
non-technical term and Jazz it up or translate it into a technical term you

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:28.160
can't do that you can go the other way you can lose Tech you can't gain

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:34.000
it it's how Mother Nature works baby it's the way up let's go to the Tower of

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.480
Babel are you ready give me what is the so the Earth is a oros let's see what is

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:46.760
the Earth it's a oros give me the next slide what is a oros please I don't mean to be all yell um here it is I just

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:54.559
wanted you to see it a oros see the last word I just blew it up right a oros can you see that everybody in Greek should

00:44:54.559 --> 00:45:00.079
be wondering what what is a or it is unseen or invisible and you can

00:45:00.079 --> 00:45:06.200
see this is just H the Greek verb to see plus the alpha privative Ah that's not

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:11.319
too that's not doesn't take much to figure that out it's the Unseen and the

00:45:11.319 --> 00:45:17.280
the invisible notice they say the toon is the Unseen World now look what the

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:23.559
Greek is doing it's taking a concept and it's taking it out of the abstract

00:45:23.559 --> 00:45:30.160
adjective form the description and it's turning it into the concrete it's making

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:36.119
it a noun and Greek is exceptionally good at doing this and as a result the

00:45:36.119 --> 00:45:42.640
Unseen becomes that which is unseen the Unseen

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:48.880
World do you know what the Unseen World is you can you could do do you know what

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:57.319
the Unseen World is no of course you don't right because this author who is

00:45:57.319 --> 00:46:06.160
writing the Torah is Faking it they are creating

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:13.839
something not passing down documents they're creating it is a Greek

00:46:13.839 --> 00:46:22.240
creation oh are you kidding do you know how much that changes history oh my God

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:27.920
it's no wonder Israel and Tel Aviv felstein it's no no wonder you were

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:34.160
there we found we found that Canaanite Temple the bottom of megiddo you know

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:39.200
that thing they call Solomon's blank Fortress or what you know it's not that

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:44.880
you know it's not that there's no archaeological evidence this is a forged

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:52.160
history it's a forged history fantastic right now presumably they want you to

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:57.359
than scribes and Scholars and Sadducees and SE

00:46:57.359 --> 00:47:04.079
and you know zealots people in deserts with pots and the end is coming that

00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:13.000
kind of people right the people with the knowledge of the Box the monest Box

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.240
because what monism does and aanan taught us

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:24.040
this and I am Amon hell Satan

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:29.839
aanan is the one who's bringing first brought that monest box everybody in the

00:47:29.839 --> 00:47:37.079
Box anybody outside the box gets killed that's all there is to it it's the form of

00:47:37.079 --> 00:47:43.760
genocide that makes the basis of the volcano of monest

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:51.359
religions it's that magma it's ultimately G to blow yes fantastic not

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:58.720
so fantastic right that time I should said not so fantastic um the Watchers thank you so stuck by the way go to the

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:06.599
next one um look at this what do they make of the that which is unseen what do they do with the Unseen World right um

00:48:06.599 --> 00:48:13.800
the translators who are trying to create a Hebrew text from the Greek sepian it's

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:19.800
very complex um formless confusion

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:27.319
unreality maybe emptiness right doesn't it sound like a shotgun sounds like a shotgun bro did

00:48:27.319 --> 00:48:32.400
you hit that the linguists that are working on this did you guys hit that with a shotgun right were you're like oh

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:37.920
I don't know but here this is bound to hit something it's from an unused word

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:44.480
what the I dare you to find I dare you to find any any classical philologist

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:52.440
that would ever say this for an unused word it sounds like your Hebrew your

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:58.880
ancient Hebrew is a forgery it sounds like you're making it up from the Greek

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:04.079
did you know there are words in Greek that are way older that the Hebrew

00:49:04.079 --> 00:49:12.480
adapts to its own in the septu it makes it creates Roots it's a forgery the

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:19.400
Torah the Old Testament the pentat the Books of

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:25.359
Moses a forgery a forgery

00:49:25.359 --> 00:49:32.280
wow wow why would you do such a thing why would you forge something like that

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:38.640
right it's appropriation it's to claim legitimacy right it's that fight that

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:45.480
Eternal fight between us and what is foreign yeah it happens over and over

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:50.640
again in history and ultimately it ends up in a genocidal

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:58.680
rainstorm yeah it's amazing amazing monism is it's the most dangerous

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.880
Quantum chemical in

00:50:04.119 --> 00:50:10.040
existence and in reflection yeah yeah it's that

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:17.480
reflection poison let's go let's go to the next one um um what is a so you can

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:23.400
see that the Hebrew is is not able to approximate what is aat now look at this

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:29.799
word you can just look at this what else is the world in creation

00:50:29.799 --> 00:50:37.559
it's now you can see from this Greek that this is not a short little word this thing is built not only does

00:50:37.559 --> 00:50:44.640
this thing have a root but it's also got a prefix and an alpha privative okay now watch how the meaning

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:51.200
changes what is this [Music] thing what is an earth that is that um

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:57.280
we'll start with scos that means something prepared by art right it's

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:02.400
artificial as opposed to futos and what is

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:09.000
futos that is something that has fuo that has nature that's been

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:16.079
engendered that's been engendered and this word scalos is used of drugs right

00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:21.720
why because drugs are prepared they're artificial constructions when they're

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:27.240
talking pharmica right they're not talking plants now they're talking all

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:34.200
of the plant substances that we're combining and we're treating with this and this wash and we do the 6 months

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:40.920
later it turns out you take the stuff and it turns you into Frankenstein right okay what is this

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:48.599
thing here look at it's a drug but look at um galin there at the bottom it also uses thumi amata what are thumi amata

00:51:48.599 --> 00:51:54.839
those are things that you inhale right you come over and there's a you know

00:51:54.839 --> 00:52:00.599
Priestess and she's singing and she's burning some stuff and after a while you

00:52:00.599 --> 00:52:05.920

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:45.119
to talk about the magic of the catamites you knew that I would have to bring her in right she's the queen let's go to the

00:52:45.119 --> 00:52:51.240
next one so what happens with that scalos when I add Conta to it watch the Greek

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:59.240
form real Concepts artificial is opposed to a self gener rated right um under

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:07.920
artificial conditions and then suborned when you talk about people or um being

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:14.839
suborned oh God now let's add an alpha privative to the front of it watch how

00:53:14.839 --> 00:53:21.160
it changes the meaning what is this thing out of the Bible

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:28.200
a not properly prepared and the first example they give is a fon

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:34.200
right unformed unwrought

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:40.400
unpolished now give me the next one please give me the next one what is the

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:46.040
hus what do you think of akatas you think it's

Aon Aon look at that beautiful long word how it's K plus filo plus a on the front

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:59.319
of it what does it mean what does it mean I'm chasing these words words I think I think I'm I'm ecstatic or

00:53:59.319 --> 00:54:04.480
something because it's they seem to all be connected aalos means without

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:08.400
adornment without

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:16.119
adornment okay how is it going to be translated into Hebrew this

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:22.680
term are you ready here we go

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:29.359
emptiness now you can hear it you can hear it if I just explained

00:54:29.359 --> 00:54:38.160
everything I explained to you to a third grader they would say

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:43.760
emptiness yes yes do you see what the Hebrew

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:49.440
Scholars were doing Hebrew was so dead

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.839
that they only had 8,000 words to work with and the best that you can do is

00:54:54.839 --> 00:55:02.680
come up with something that sounds like the Epic of Gilgamesh it's just a fact of

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:09.480
nature mother Greek is a monstrous she's a

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:20.160

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:59.960
Springs unfathomable boundless right boundless now look at definition

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:06.359
number two what is what is it when you take this word and Greek does this this is again power of the language it'll

00:56:06.359 --> 00:56:11.839
take now that adjective bottomless UNF

00:56:11.839 --> 00:56:16.920
unfathomed right which by the way puts the what is unfathomed that's the mind

the apocalypse wait a minute I think we have a Victorian I think we have a Victorian who's messing with

00:56:54.079 --> 00:57:00.599
us do you see what happens where we're trying to define a word based upon its

00:57:00.599 --> 00:57:06.000
neighborhood and its neighborhood is a select text group of texts the New

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:13.039
Testament and septu and that's it they're trying to create a special

00:57:13.039 --> 00:57:18.680
Divergent definition and this is a no no

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:25.799
this is a no no let's keep going go to the next one watch this people boom what

00:57:25.799 --> 00:57:34.520
are we do with it third grade man Rocka an extended surface or an

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:40.559
expanse a surface or an expanse you see how here how basic that is a surface or

00:57:40.559 --> 00:57:47.880
an expans okay so my tech is dropping I'm losing my tech give me one more example

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:56.720
I'm going to show you this one more time now you'll be able to predict it yourself or was that the one more did we Skip One um yeah here here's the now

00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:27.039
cosmology right okay fine immaterial solids

00:58:27.039 --> 00:58:32.880
Foundation or framework for example it's the Skeleton on which the body is as it

[Music] waters yep and if you and I are on

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:27.960

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:39.119
seed and perpetuates everything

01:00:39.119 --> 01:00:46.280
yeah that Prius that is the spirit of the

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:51.520
Lees who overcomes the kitis because the

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.960
reason the kitis is so important and why Jesus has one is you have to have that

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.240
poison along with that kitis

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:09.480
