tonight that is history and as usual the actual history

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.480
is way more interesting than the fairy

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.239
tale the fairy tale You Follow The Who and the h

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.720
and the Virgin birth and it doesn't matter because that

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.200
reality didn't exist I'll show you the one that did through the very

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.519
words and this is where this magic trick becomes so difficult that I can't do it

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.880
without my assistant The Muse I can't do it I can't pull it out

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.600
myself I need something some kind of cheat so what are we going to do we're going to pull it right through the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.880
words it's magic right out of the words I'm G to give you a vision of Jesus

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:50.320

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:24.160

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.880
paying attention we've got ears to hear tonight in the text I'm going to show

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.479
you you see all this cult stuff you're so lucky you get to see it

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.520

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:51.759

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:58.960
what are we we are transdimensional child protective

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:10.280
services that's what we are and we are really pushing to get to the abuse of children

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:16.120
it's ultimately where we end up when we jump into the Bible isn't that

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:23.280
interesting isn't that interesting so um that's the badge that we're wearing tonight I deputize you all here we go

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.680
we're going to be looking for the drugs as standard we're going to be looking for cult activity and we're going to be

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:35.440
looking for sex sexual activity that makes us very uncomfortable

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:42.520
so put on your courage this is the Bible

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.919
yeah chewy I want to take us first before we go anywhere I want to take

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:54.560
everybody at the congregation go down to this picture right here yeah go ahead go

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:01.280
ahead oh God does everybody see this this is Mount

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:07.360
tamus and what happened on this Mount this is where the

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:14.599
Meads came into being this is the source and the origin

00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:19.680
of the mystery from this

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:30.759
mountain from this mountain came the bonic flood that swept across Asia and Europe

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:37.760
was from this place ultimately that the voice at delie

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:44.200
hearkened back to this is the

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:50.920
worship of somebody who will bring us the

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.120
Savior this is the power of the bakic

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:03.399
ritual that forged in our history a religion that you ultimately

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:10.360
sprang from talking to us all monest

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.839
descendants what did they do they did a

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:23.079
mystery they did a mystery and I'm going to show it to you now the funny thing

00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:29.920
is and I'm saving the climax for the end you're not going to believe it because you need to see other people other dead

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:36.200
people saying dude this dude's a total pirate right and this kid stuff let me

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:42.519

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:48.760
we're agents we have to go in and where are we going in we're going into the history we're going right into where

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:57.800
Jesus is right in so tonight if you are uncomfortable with this sort of welfare

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.920

you a Jesus before Pilate like you've never

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:43.880
seen and it's not coming from me it's coming from Antiquity okay so you have to realize

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:50.560
that none of these are my ideas right all we do right all we do is

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:56.560
we give them the sources okay let's put out if we're going to if we're going to promise

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:23.079
first time let's go let's go give me the first one in the order of Randomness that is

00:11:23.079 --> 00:11:30.240
the universe we start with the drugs

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:37.639
Jesus on the night of his

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:45.800
apprehension was surrounded by drugs here's the first example that that we

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.120
have what did they do um they gave to him wine that was

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:57.839
smic it had Smyrna in it now these wines are of various

00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:05.279
strengths and different potencies and do all sorts of different things what is

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:10.320
this particular activity you're going to see drugs that are associated with

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:16.720
sexual ritual I'm going to show you a woman in the midst of a sexual ritual

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:23.120
involving Jesus let's go look right from the beginning they're giving him drugs right from the beginning where was that

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.560
I don't know somewhere on his journey here's Mark 14:48 and what happens Jesus

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.120
responding he said to them right how'd you come out here like a Malay

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:39.519
days how'd you come out we've all seen this you came out with your big weapons

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:48.360
right like your Swamp People give me the next one that's the night preceding the early morning hours

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:55.160
preceding his crucifixion all the way up to this point

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:02.680
in Mark by this time you've got a crowd of people formed within just a few hours and what

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:09.160
are they doing they're screaming out St

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:15.760
Alon crucify him crucify him something he

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.600
did got him to this point within a very short period of time give me the next

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:28.320
one he knew it was coming he knew it was coming right what is Jesus's State of

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:35.760
Mind before the crucifixion we know he's stumbly bumbly

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.720
confused and won't answer questions he's stumbly bumbly confused

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:52.000
and won't answer questions that's all through what the text tells us why because he's been somewhere all

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.160
night in a room with 12

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:06.000
underage boys that he has lured away from their

00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:13.959
parents we have the we have the luring scenes right did you ever wonder that

00:14:13.959 --> 00:14:20.480
well you think in the fairy tale you think well there he is Jesus right you know if Jesus walks up and asks me for

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:26.399
my kid right I'm going to give him my kid no you wouldn't no you wouldn't I'll

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:36.120
send a guy down to your house tomorrow dress like Jesus yeah no you wouldn't do that do you see

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:42.480
the reality that you have to peel back all of the garbage theology from it's

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:51.160
just sitting there just get rid get rid of the Theology and look at what the text is saying just make it very human

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:58.120
make it very human you know what the most technologically advanced people in

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:06.480
Antiquity and the Le Bron's age did they were women and they were known to be

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:13.399
exceptionally good with human speech I mean it sounds kind of silly doesn't it

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:20.079
right but um they are using language that is

00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:26.120
enabling them to take scientific leaps and they're doing so in the

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:33.720
pharmacology and that's where we're getting this mystery from that's where we're getting this mystery from so good thing ladies ladies keep it

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:40.440
up love it love it right oh God where's the Amazonian bring out the Amazonian is

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:46.199
there a way jwy to get the Amazonian woman to come out did we did you have a

00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:52.680
pick or anything I don't know give me the next little bit of evidence here that's gonna show us the

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:58.720
crucifixion by the way people these are all authentic clues about what's going

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.759
on here's Mark 157 there's this dude

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:12.240
barabus and what is barabus doing there he's there for

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:19.959
stasis it says it twice it uses it in a verbal form and a nominal form why they

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:27.199
want you to make sure this dude was an insurrectionist when they had a

00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:32.600
choice the mom mob when the mob had a

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:39.240
choice that had assembled between Jesus and an insurrectionist they chose Jesus

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:47.800
to send to the Cross so you have to realize the level of hate in the now I

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.920
know you thought it was Disney and it was oh Mel Gibson the devil's walking in

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:59.880
the ride like a third grader Mel you know what you got to do Mel

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:05.720
you gotta go look up Inky Doo you gota you gotta go back to that

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.120
Sumerian garbage oh I'm sorry I know I know all

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:17.120
of you all of you near Eastern lists you leave your

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.880
comments but you know underneath when you go to bed at night you know the

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:28.000
Greek devil is laying with your wife

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:35.799
love it it's yummy oh God people this is elevating stuff can't you feel it

00:17:35.799 --> 00:17:40.919
elevating right give me the next one come on we need to keep going um what

00:17:40.919 --> 00:17:49.679
happened Jesus right he breathed out right after his last great

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:56.120
voice yeah he issued out that Spirit

00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:02.280
pelma pelma what's going on is this normal death nope

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:09.320
nope nope and it's not considered a normal death now remember while on the

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:17.320
cross Jesus is not dying of crucifixion he's not dying of

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:24.200
crucifixion he's dying purposefully because he is performing a

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:31.600
mystery that involved a few hours earlier a lot drugs and a naked

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:39.679
kid with a bandage on his hooa a medicated

00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:46.679
bandage yeah okay so here we are here we are

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:54.600
with Jesus in the process so do you see what's happening the mystery is to be put into

00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:00.520
death and resurrected chemically

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:08.760
what's he done he started the process [Laughter]

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:16.200
but very very ironically he gets crucified in the

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:23.799
process can you imagine being in that altered state imagine this people just

00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:30.919
for a minute sit back on the throne by the way sit back on the throne do your s cian thing right where's everybody doing

00:19:30.919 --> 00:19:38.240
their cyan right do it now imagine this is your

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:44.559
trip your trip involves a descent an

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:52.320
uncomfortable descent into death right now when Jesus is in the

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:59.480
garden did you see him descending into death oh God and then a rest

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:07.280
Resurrection in order for there to be an initiation in order there to be a

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:15.159
toit are you ready to see Jesus use the very words himself while Jesus is being

00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:22.760
crucified he is undergoing the mystery death and

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.240

did Jesus do when he was hanging on the cross he took some ox

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:30.159
sauce he took some ox sauce yeah he took some ox sauce and he said

00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:42.679
do you know what a tete is a tete is an initiate in a mystery who has been

00:27:42.679 --> 00:27:48.080
submerged into death and

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:53.799
resurrected with white linen

00:27:54.279 --> 00:27:59.600
gowns do you see what he says here

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:06.279
because right after he says this he slumps

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:14.799
over he slumps over on the cross people are watching him right there's a following of his there watching him

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.799
right he is entered and he knows it and

00:28:25.799 --> 00:28:31.519
that's why he drinks the oxis he is entered the death he knows he is he's

00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:37.039
already said I am afraid my soul is at the point of

00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:43.279
death yes and taking of the fruit you won't

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:49.679
die he knows he knows how it works and he knows

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:56.200
he's taking what he needs to take in order to come back that

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:01.840
oxus I'm going to show you a source give me the next one give me the

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:07.000
next one oh God you didn't realize it was so druggy did you right it's so

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.880
druggy the whole thing Christ is a drug term people why did nobody see that

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:19.799
Christ is a drug isn't it funny let's laugh right satanic congregation let's let's Mock and Jer tonight shall we

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:26.880
there's a time and a place for everything there's a muse of mocking

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:33.679
yes why why did it take people so long to figure out what a Christ was right

00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:40.440
imagine all the dead people from the Middle Ages the times of

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:48.039
darkness when civilization classical civilization gave in to the

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:54.039
monest power what happened things went to

00:29:54.039 --> 00:30:00.200
garbage things went to garbage no no no no this this is before then and we are

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:04.278
still performing the

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.720
mystery oh God how many drugs is Jesus gonna be on give me the next

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:17.559
one watch this people um that is one account here's another

00:30:17.559 --> 00:30:26.000
from John they're G giving him that sponge right which is full full of the o

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.840
sauce right okay why are those people who are

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.720
standing around offering Jesus

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:43.039
drugs why give me the next

00:30:48.679 --> 00:30:56.120
one because he needs the antidote to what he

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:02.679
has just been tripping on in the garden with the naked kid remember he could

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:08.880
barely walk kept falling on the ground screaming about death coming

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.039
death ah it's like a he's

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:20.039
tripping he's tripping on these drugs that they're mentioning

00:31:20.039 --> 00:31:25.080
right and he doesn't want it to happen what is the dude saying can we hear from

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:31.360
Jesus himself from this he just turns up his prayer let this

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:40.039
stuff let it go away right oh God what is this hour that must

00:31:40.039 --> 00:31:46.080
be endured now you can either see this in

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:52.960
the fairy tale it's h and his father's H and he's H

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:58.360
and everything is right or

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:04.840
you can see it that they knew what these drugs did to the body

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:10.760
and he saw what was coming and to be quite honest with you you know I hate to

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:16.080
give him any credit but when he says it's

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:21.399
tough when he says it's tough to enter into these rights with the naked kid I

00:32:21.399 --> 00:32:29.960
kind of had a Little Bit of Sympathy for him just a little bit just a little bit but the fact that he made up 12 beds for

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:37.880
those teenagers in some shady Place some shady Motel

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.880
Six it wasn't even that sophisticated I'm sorry Motel 6 I'm sorry but I've had

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:49.279
some shade you know what I mean um

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:57.120
look I'm gonna check in overnight in a shady place and I'm going

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:05.080
to make sure there are 12 beds there I'm going to take all of my

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:10.480
students give me the next one give me the next one this is all leading up to

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:16.080
that crucifixion so he is entering into that mystery we know he is because Mary

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:24.559
has has forced him to basically gave him the jet fuel to take off right remember

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:33.000
one of the effects one of the effects of these drugs is to make you rock

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:40.240
hard physically in a in a

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:48.760
reproductive sort how do I explain it um supposed to give you prism medically

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:55.760
prism right there it's sustained and uncomfortable erection right it's a medical don't

00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:02.279
blame me it's a medical thing right what is Jesus witnessing what is

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:09.079
he saying out of his mouth during this period where he is undergoing the mystery he says he's in great

00:34:09.079 --> 00:34:17.240
pain his soul is pushed to the brink of death do

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.960
you see that in the second line thanu do you know where his perception

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:30.398
is going he's going to hell only there there's no Priestess

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:36.480
there there's no overseer to guide him in that process he's just in an open

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.760
Park and he's been freaking paranoid all night so he's just in an open park with

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:46.560
a naked kid there for the antidote

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:54.358

do you see the mystery in Opp reparation what did they say about the

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:08.400
process it's a process of waking up it's a process of understanding and of

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.960
hearing the voice and of hearing the

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:21.000
voice huh okay all right so is Jesus using the

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.839
very same lingo that you know um priests Greek priests will use of course he is

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:35.800

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:42.319
rights fantastic you understand okay are you ready for this remember the crowd

00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:47.839

the death State can you imagine because he knows he's dying right and what what

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:59.680
do the text say that happens to people who enter the death State via these drugs you can't tell you can even take

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:07.680
their pulse and you can't tell that they're alive oh God can you imagine he's

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:15.400
entering into that state while he's being

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:21.400
crucified what a what an interesting crucifixion you know what I mean there

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:29.359
were other people mocking him there too one of the one of the Pirates was like ah you suck

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:37.560
yeah why I'll tell you why it's the first question he got asked everywhere he went

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:43.000
are you the Christos and you

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.640

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:10.960
the place nobody nobody seemed to bother how do these people know Christians wake

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:16.480
up how do these people know what a Christ is if it doesn't

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:23.800
pre-exist they're all interested in it the Jewish authorities the

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:31.640
Romans what is this dude huh uhhuh look at them do you understand the

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:36.920
contempt now do you understand because they knew what he would have to be doing

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:43.880
with that naked kid that they tried to apprehend but couldn't because he was

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:49.280

the use of drugs and I'm not just talking about you're giving them hits a crack Ryan I'm not talking about that

00:47:12.599 --> 00:47:20.040
I'm talking about a sophisticated control where you're turning that person into a sax

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:26.920
machine right you give somebody so much X Y or Z made a laboratory next thing you know they're looking like death

they're not doing that you can take these boys you can castrate them and the

00:47:32.599 --> 00:47:37.799
Thracians by the way have a trade in this they know how to do

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:43.680
it did somebody say zagreus right do you

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:49.599
know why dionisis is associated with the

00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:54.720
pirate yeah yeah he turned them all into

00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:00.920

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:07.079
one throw me on we're still getting crucified we haven't opened up with the big ones yet I'm going tonight the

00:48:07.079 --> 00:48:13.359
climax is going to be the end forgive the people who are who who have already left us forget your people you're not

00:48:13.359 --> 00:48:19.599
going to get brought to the to the top of the mountain you know what I mean yeah we're going to the top of that

00:48:19.599 --> 00:48:25.160
mountain tonight yeah yeah yeah wonderful um I

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:31.599
just want you to look at the second line and I want you to notice one word estr

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:37.680
Menon the dude showed them the place they were going to be staying and it was

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:46.640
prepared the beds were made up okay the beds were made up so

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:54.640
whatever Jesus is doing he's taking 12 students to a place

00:48:54.640 --> 00:49:01.880
where they know they're going to be staying overnight now a lot of you may say well that doesn't necessarily imply

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:08.400
remember this is after giving them things that are tainted with drugs and

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:14.040
the best example of that is Judas because what does Judas do Judas goes

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:19.160
out turns him in and shortly thereafter dies of an

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:23.119
overdose of a sex

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:29.559
drug depress this baby give me that some give me that give me

00:49:29.559 --> 00:49:35.720
that bepress this it had too much in it it had too much in it you know you can

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:42.040
take those things and you can end your end Your Existence if you're not

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:47.920
careful right it's a it's a careful art being a Christ is a very careful art

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:53.240
you've got to be sure that the stuff that you're putting into people's

00:49:53.240 --> 00:50:00.520
eyes it's the stuff that will get them be beyond the death into that zone that

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:08.880
is worth bringing all that knowledge back from death and Resurrection baby it's a

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:14.040
drug thing you haven't seen the crucifixion before I know you haven't

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:22.400
because you thought he was sitting he what was he doing he was taking what he was accepting the sins of the world what

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.078
are you smoking

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:36.319
what are you people the biggest the biggest lunatic drug users on the planet are the people who smoke that fairy tale

00:50:36.319 --> 00:50:44.880
they smoke it and you know you can't intervene because it's their dope you can't

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:50.720
intervene the best thing to do is to show them what their dope is and their

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:58.520
dope is a dude is arrested in a public park with a naked kid and he's getting crucified currently give me the next one

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:06.280
here's what I want to bring you this is from Luke yeah good good good good good good

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:13.799
so um this crowd is forming right and um the people

00:51:13.799 --> 00:51:20.040
that are in it are people who are not ignorant of what the dude is up

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:27.040
to right and they say look this one this one's the Christ

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:32.520
the one is chosen let him save

00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:42.799
himself let him save himself if he is the

00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:49.000
Christos right not the anointed king

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:56.599
no but one of those who have been initiated who have been there and back

00:51:56.599 --> 00:52:02.640
one of those who can do that stuff that he does like heal the

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:08.079
sick right cast out your demons he did that a lot with

00:52:08.079 --> 00:52:15.280
Mary he made her eat his eulate it's in one of the texts the

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:21.440
Christians don't like letter letters of Mary or something like that lesser

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:27.280
letters of Mary one of those right this is all a part of the

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:33.319
process that we have if we are a pirate because what do pirates do they

00:52:33.319 --> 00:52:40.880
condition children to enter the sex trade they condition students to enter

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:50.599
the sex trade and what are they using they're performing the mystery right it was anomia it was

00:52:50.599 --> 00:52:58.319
lawlessness yes that Jesus himself was doing he was performing forming it even

00:52:58.319 --> 00:53:05.160
Paul said that it's already in operation that mystery of

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:12.040
anomia that's the place we are without law do you understand Lady Justice has

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:17.839
to be served these creeps have to get what they get and that's what you and I

00:53:17.839 --> 00:53:23.520
are living for we're part of that child protective

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:28.760
service instinctively I mean instinctively if you're not look if you

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:34.119
don't like kids and dogs right I'm sorry kids and animals would just say animals

00:53:34.119 --> 00:53:39.799
if you don't like kids or animals my grandmother would say you're a

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:48.559
turd let's get back to it it's an internal Justice you see people it's

00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:56.079
nothing now you know why that stuff ripples out into the ether right and people want to hear what

00:53:56.079 --> 00:54:04.040
right because they have that instinct to protect those children if you're a pirate like Jesus was you're swimming

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:10.920
Upstream you're taking those kids and molding them look what he did look what

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:17.640
he did boom blew up into an organization

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:24.599
with money you could have sold that stuff

00:54:24.599 --> 00:54:30.119
Jesus you could have kept it quiet and just sold it turned your tricks you had

00:54:30.119 --> 00:54:35.680
to go big you had to go big and he did he hit the theater of the crucifixion

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:41.480
imagine that you have to understand imagine you're ending your

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:48.119
life in a public execution where they are bathing you in

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:53.960
drugs your followers know what you were doing right Mary's not stupid you're the

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:59.880
one who you're the one who offered your SE demon you know there's a whole sack that does this by the way Jesus is not

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:04.960
the only one there's a whole sack they call me of fites they do the Sean

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:11.760
communion what right hanging on the cross with these

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:18.079
drugs on board the pirate is truly

00:55:18.599 --> 00:55:23.880
suffering it's beginning to sound like the sins of the world were heaped on

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:30.520
that guy's shoulders it's speak didn't sound like it daddy's son is a dirty

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:35.799
pirate give me the next one um people let's go somewhere quick look people

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:42.480
don't have time we got what do we have here he said look you never put your hands on me right what you what what are

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:50.359
you doing right um this is the he's Jesus is being given in to this

00:55:50.359 --> 00:55:57.520
Authority right this is the hour of his Darkness

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:04.160
okay this is a stage in the drug right you enter the

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:12.520
darkness you enter the darkness and why are you saying that because that's what they all say oh my

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:18.640
God Jesus is being crucified while he is dying in a right that is meant to cause

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:23.760
you to die and then come back

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:30.599
and he's fully erect he's fully

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.079
erect now what's supposed to be happening this is supposed to be some

00:56:36.079 --> 00:56:41.559
interaction of that aspect so that while he enters the death he enters in a state

00:56:41.559 --> 00:56:47.680
of mind that is let's just say orgasmic does that have anything to do I

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:53.240
don't know what the physics of that are I don't know what the brain chemistry that is can we even can somebody

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:58.440
research that I don't think you legally research that that but there he is on

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:06.119
the cross and now you understand why they mocked him on the cross because he was a

00:57:06.119 --> 00:57:15.160
Christ why do you think they're always stripping him because he's got an erection he's got an erection a

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:21.000
sustained painful erection to follow him down into

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:28.760
the depths of Despair and death oh dude what a dude this Jesus

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:06.359
want you to try to match this when Jesus is in the

00:58:06.359 --> 00:58:14.480
struggle that he is in in the garden when he enters that place that he

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:22.280
asks please don't let this freaking happen he goes for it what

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:29.440

dripping down onto the ground around him you see

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.440

00:59:41.359 --> 00:59:47.920
lubricant the fluid of life that's what she is you see that dark blue that's

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:54.480
where mother Greek just pounded everybody just dominated and killed everything else in its vicinity you see

00:59:54.480 --> 01:00:01.799
the light blue right that is where the Greek dominated

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:08.640
but but there was enough of a clash of the locals that it wasn't so forceful as

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:15.079
it was in that deep blue you couldn't live in that deep blue without getting saturated with Mother Greek look at all

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:35.119
years and I never seen the book of Zoe who's this

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:43.359
Zoe she's in the first edition of the thing you call the Bible and it's in

01:06:43.359 --> 01:06:48.559
Greek and she is the reason that you're here

01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:54.520
that's what that's what you you're going to recognize

01:06:54.520 --> 01:07:00.640
it isn't it funny somebody who's been around this stuff their entire life and

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:07.359
only penetrated the English they it's very easy people right now um Danny

01:07:07.359 --> 01:07:15.039
Jones is trying to get somebody to come and meet me somebody to come and meet me

01:07:15.039 --> 01:07:22.880
in order to discuss what a Christ is in order to discuss what ancient

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:27.920
mystery is in order to discuss most importantly

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:35.319
and this one I'm this one is the one this is the big one why was Jesus arrested in a public park with a naked

01:07:35.319 --> 01:07:40.839
kid screaming I'm not a child trafficker

01:07:40.839 --> 01:07:46.440
why why um and

01:07:46.559 --> 01:07:54.960
unfortunately it's been hard finding somebody who will sit

01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:02.839
across from me at a table and discuss yeah do you know why I'll tell

01:08:02.839 --> 01:08:09.480
you why it's so tough because they know the one thing they keep saying consistently over and over again is he

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:18.798
goes the he does go to the Greek right let's go to the Greek and they can't handle that they're afraid seminarians

01:08:18.799 --> 01:08:24.480
priests preachers people who work in synagogues that educ that religious

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:29.318
education oh God the

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.920
mullers it's off they tell you they do Greek and they

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:44.400
don't and it's very easy to sit there with somebody and just to show people the world what I hear within about two

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:51.520
minutes of somebody talking I can tell this person doesn't work with the sources they don't know they this person

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:56.560
will be very easily toppled right if they are stupid enough

01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:02.199
to show up now um so far we haven't found anybody who's stupid enough to

01:09:02.199 --> 01:09:08.758
show up or arrogant right not not quite arrogant enough to try to show up and

01:09:08.759 --> 01:09:17.080
why is that people people keep asking me why do you know this stuff why is this so personal why is it why haven't people

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:23.199
told me people Christ is a drug term you're only going to know that if you're

01:09:23.199 --> 01:09:28.520
reading the scientific and it is just a fact that this stuff

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:34.000
goes totally ignored especially in modern scholarship it's just the way it is it's just the way it is people would

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:42.758
rather study home or in Virgil and I don't blame them that's fun that's fun okay um that's why it's not because

01:09:42.759 --> 01:09:49.159
I'm special it's not because I'm special and it's not like this can't be repeated I

01:09:49.159 --> 01:09:57.320
am telling you there is a Christ out there and it means a drug right

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:05.880
here we go here we go it's getting christed give me give me the next one I want people to see this um no not that

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:12.600

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:33.199
voice of God want us to do what does the voice of Apocalypse want us to

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:42.280
do look people you've got a few names in

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:50.560
Sardis which have not soiled their

garments now what is what the hell does that mean right and everybody's like oh and that analogy doesn't work

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:04.280
remember it's part of a right how do you come out of the right you come out when

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:10.559
you are producing those stained

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:18.800
garments yeah and he's saying the voice of the Apocalypse is telling him I know

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:26.440

created right these are the people that are going to walk with me in

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.440
the white in the white why is that because they have been

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:45.600
determined to be oxy do you remember what Alexander the false prophet was doing he was Finding

wasn't here's the mystery author I wanted to show you here's the mystery

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:41.280
author I want to show you are you ready for this

01:23:42.199 --> 01:23:49.239
um um this is nonas and nonas is paraphrasing the Gospel of John so what

01:23:49.239 --> 01:23:55.040
you're getting is the Gospel of John Through The Eyes of somebody from antiquity

01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:00.920
somebody who is well familiar with medical things well

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:08.360
familiar with drugs oh yeah he knew it he knew all the stuff what does he call the Christ and that is what I'm talking

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:16.600
about Jesus here in this situation is Jesus what is he calling this Christ he's saying he's the Christ who is

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:21.840
prophetic peso do you understand you're not going

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:27.880
to if you're going to come back from a death State and being on the other side you're going to bring back something

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:33.400
with you the process of christing it wasn't just prophetic with Jesus it was

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:39.320
prophetic with whoever was doing it and we know it was done in the late Bronze Age we have a text for it by a woman

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:46.280
named media who coincidentally is called Diana and is considered to be the

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:52.159
founder of her rights okay I showed you the temple I

01:24:52.159 --> 01:24:57.880
showed you the reality the this is a reality for Jesus on the cross right

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:04.320
we're just about to bust things open here's the hros now I want you to look at the sweat that's on Jesus just look

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.360
at number two that sweat can also be a sweat of

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:15.679
something a product of something like an opium poppy head you know what I mean it can be an

01:25:15.679 --> 01:25:23.719
exudation of the plant something that leaks out of the plant that kind of thing and you'll notice here gum right

01:25:23.719 --> 01:25:31.280
res res resin right fantastic um what is that stuff on

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:39.199
Jesus's face is what we're really getting to and why would he be carrying it Jesus is in a mental state on the

01:25:39.199 --> 01:25:45.320
cross of being troubled in

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:53.440
anguish and this is term for all of you who don't like medical look in the purple at the bottom notice that it's

01:25:53.440 --> 01:26:00.639
derives from Adon which is found only as V1 in

01:26:00.639 --> 01:26:07.400
hypocrates epidemics why are those victorians

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:13.800
quoting these scientific sources because it's how the language is being used

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:20.040
people and they're not stupid they're not stupid right now what are they fighting

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:26.840
against what are they fighting against you see this combat in this Oxford

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:32.639
lexicon constantly you'll see within one definition a little

01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:38.560
constellation of Bible references with Biblical definitions

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:44.440
that are theologically influenced and when you see those you realize ah those

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:51.520
victorians they were still operating in a world where the monest cult had burned

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:57.400
everything and it saturated its presence you know what we don't need we just need

01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:02.880
people who read Greek and who read a lot right who know all the sources and can

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:11.520
work with those sources right nobody can know them all because there's a lot but um yeah uh this is a new thing people

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:18.040
people are going to open this up and say oh my God right it's coming that's why they won't meet me they won't meet me

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:23.480
because they know they're going to get a thrashing because they don't know what this word is as Jesus hangs on the cross

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:31.239
in his thr this word around himself they don't know what a lace stas is here's

01:27:31.239 --> 01:27:37.320

people screaming you know you know let it let let it happen right how did we

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:08.480
get here to this state of mind always with hymns people this is what Jesus

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:16.679
does as he is entering into the uh mystery operation with the

01:29:16.679 --> 01:29:22.760
naked kid they're accompanied by songs accompanied by songs who do you think

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.039

01:30:20.719 --> 01:30:26.360
right he is entering into that death and

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:32.119
Resurrection oh God how did he get caught in the middle of this right give

01:30:32.119 --> 01:30:38.880
me the next one it was just because of the kids and that's why Jesus keeps saying you're gonna be scandalized look

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:28.320
special that I can bring this to you you know what this is again this is John in

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:35.080
paraphrase by nonas and um what does he say here he

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:43.719
says he's talking about the arrest of Jesus and when he's taken before Pilate and all that he says

01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:51.649
[Music]

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:06.040
St right what is that what does that say look at that first word I

01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:14.400
man nuts nuts when the leader of the people

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:21.280
heard this dude Jesus saying crazy

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:29.199
stuff out of a mouth that was Furious yeah wait a minute what what

01:32:29.199 --> 01:32:36.239
what kind of dude is this Jesus he's a lace stain he beat him up he whipped

01:32:36.239 --> 01:32:42.639
him do you see what this text is doing it's referring to Jesus Christ it's a

01:32:42.639 --> 01:32:48.719
paraphrase the Gospel of John in this chapter and what does it do calls Jesus

01:32:48.719 --> 01:32:56.679
a lace stays I am not the one who came up with that they were doing it in

01:32:56.679 --> 01:33:03.199
Antiquity they were doing it in Antiquity do you know what pilate

01:33:03.199 --> 01:33:09.239
thought of Jesus he thought he was another human sex trafficker right he thought he was

01:33:09.239 --> 01:33:18.360
another give me the next one I'm not the one saying this people and while he's on the cross remember he's not able to

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:25.119
respond the only thing he does is identify himself as a Christ

01:33:25.119 --> 01:33:31.600
yeah other than that he doesn't engage in the conversation frustrates the hell out of everybody around him do you know

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:40.800
why they put on him the purple that is the blood of the kohu this what this is

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:48.520
saying right we are involved in the processing of the purple

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:57.239
when we work for artemisa and this cult has been around for a a long time by the time Jesus gets

01:33:57.239 --> 01:34:02.920
there but his handling of the initiation it went a

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:08.960
foul and he ended up where did he end up he ended up on a cross of all places

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:14.159
getting crucified give me the next one I'm going to give you here's one more we've only got a couple more and we're

01:34:14.159 --> 01:34:20.080
done um I want you to see though this is the real climax this is the real punch

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:25.360
are you ready I just want you to see

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:32.040
this is notice as paraphrase of the point in the Gospel of John when they

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:39.600
grab that um sponge and they soak it they soak

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:45.239
it in that oxos right here

01:34:45.239 --> 01:34:52.760
anus a some dude thought he heard him say oxus so he went and get the sponge

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:58.320
and he fills the sponge with what this is line 152 for those of you don't

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:03.440
sources sources stick

01:35:05.119 --> 01:35:11.760
this excuse me what is a p it's a drink it's a

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:16.920
potion and it's a combo a drug combo and

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:22.440
what is dreo how does he describe that give me the next slide and then I want to go

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:29.239
back to that one how does he describe that thing he describes it with

01:35:29.239 --> 01:35:35.400
this word drus which means piercing sharp or Keen keep reading keep reading

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:40.560

Roman numeral 2 with pungent drugs again a medical

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:53.960
reference do you see what the victorians were doing In 1855 they were bringing in these sources

01:35:53.960 --> 01:36:01.679
and that was a no no because what that does is expose the actual history of the

01:36:01.679 --> 01:36:08.719
Christianity some kind of bitter pungent drug are you kidding give me the next one um I mean give me the last one that

01:36:08.719 --> 01:36:15.520

the Smyrna all right again I remind you we're talking about people talking about

01:37:49.159 --> 01:37:54.239
compound drugs and how to use them within the rights that are religious and

01:37:54.239 --> 01:38:00.719
that's why God is telling you in the apocalypse to put the Christ into your

01:38:00.719 --> 01:38:07.679
eyes last but not least look at the second line

01:38:07.679 --> 01:38:15.560
anes do you know where Jesus is on the cross this is the last depiction via the

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:21.840
paraphrase of nonas and he says where is Jesus hanging on that cross he's hanging

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:29.000
ones right next to

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:36.440
death right coming into the death State he is

01:38:36.599 --> 01:38:43.719
a he finished off his initiation on the

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.719
cross and he leaned back his head and he

01:38:49.719 --> 01:38:55.800
entered into the death that is

01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:04.239
purposefully driven thony the death that is purposely

01:39:04.239 --> 01:39:09.599
driven what was Jesus Christ doing the jokes on you you thought he was standing

01:39:09.599 --> 01:39:15.560
there on the cross taking all that sin that hurt all your sin Little Tommy

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:22.040
every time you saw me you know what it was it was the fourth grade it was the fourth grade Tommy and you saw Miss

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:27.639

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:36.199
[Music] her right we pirates from Antiquity who

01:39:36.199 --> 01:39:42.679
traffic in human Souls know the Reigns of the control of

01:39:42.679 --> 01:39:49.400
the Christos yeah isn't it funny it all

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:56.679
comes down to that it all comes down to that to tonight what I want you to have

01:39:56.679 --> 01:40:03.520
seen is let's bring up that that final get give me that final one one more time

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:10.520
um because that's G to lead oh yeah yeah that voluntary death is

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:16.880
not a process of accepting the sins of the

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:22.639
world and giving your life into the hands of God that is not what that is

01:40:22.639 --> 01:40:29.599
that's what the the theology has told you it is that's not what this is this is the

01:40:29.599 --> 01:40:38.520
voluntary induction of death via the drugs and when Jesus took

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:45.520
that oxus he took it as the antidote and he was technically finished since he had

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:50.639
the antidote on Bor and surprise

01:40:50.639 --> 01:40:58.000
surprise they say he came out of it just like you would in a mystery cult and he

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:03.280
got up just like he said and went to

01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:10.679
Galilee you mean to tell me that the devil wants me to know that Jesus Christ

01:41:10.679 --> 01:41:16.159
was genuinely revived in a cult right that involved

01:41:16.159 --> 01:41:22.040
little children yep that's what the Greek

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:30.520
says that that's what the Greek says so next time you consider the dying Christ

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:38.400
please also consider that he was in the middle of a ritual that was meant to

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:46.480
bring him to a place of death and Resurrection realize that he

01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:52.639
died not from a cross but from a ritual

01:41:52.639 --> 01:41:59.320
that was made meant to kill him yeah the

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:07.440
history the anthropology the archaeology it's always way more interesting than the garbage that the

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:13.280
theologians pump out in order to control you in order to keep you monest so that

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:20.320
they can get rid of the rest of us thank you for coming tonight it's

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:26.400
very important that we as members of the satanic

congregation find a place to

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:37.719
hunt it's very important that we be allowed to

01:42:37.719 --> 01:42:45.040
worship as the dead worshiped

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:53.560

01:42:53.560 --> 01:43:00.719
