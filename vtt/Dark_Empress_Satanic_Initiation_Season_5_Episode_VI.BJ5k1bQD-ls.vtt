00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:25.559
you to get these navigation charts with these Imperial oh this is beautiful pull down the

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:31.880
satanic initiation Fantastic look at this guys and now we'll just work our way down Artemis

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:38.340
Artemis notice what they have at the bottom they have Artemis equals

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:45.000
right who is this alethia who is this alethia she is the one she is the well

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:52.620
it's uncertain derived from we don't know where it's derived from but we know we have artemos and Artemis and artamos

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:59.340
is somebody who's kills for a living it could be that because she is a Huntress

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:04.400
she is a Huntress somebody who kills four

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:11.940
a calling yeah kills for a calling you know it can be your calling to kill

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:17.700
in antiquity isn't that interesting fantastic let's

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:25.039
go um under Artemis yep underneath her

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:31.200
um what happens if you take that name Artemis play with it a little bit

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.240
um you can either get a killer or you can get a Healer strangely enough

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:45.059
um from that from that root you can get safety and you can get death

00:21:45.059 --> 00:21:52.320
safety and death do you remember what Medea was doing why does it say that Medea was made that

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.720
princess that Priestess why did it say that she was made that one who had the

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:03.299
right of killing a stranger had the right of killing a stranger when

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:08.400
you hand somebody over to DK to Justice they

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:15.179
are subject to she who has the power to kill

00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:23.280
yes yeah fantastic if you can hear within that the principles that those

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.380
who created democracy said May resonate

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:35.159
it does with me I think we're watching it

00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:41.400
um let's go to the next one um Artemis Artemisia back uh I think we're up one yeah up one

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:48.840
yeah Artemisia what is that wormwood oh it's just a plant what you know Artemisia absintheum right no problem

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:54.840
there but look what we have here at the very bottom ambrosia

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.880
you realize we just took a little detour down a bunch of several drugs right

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:07.500
they're using these as drugs and the ritual concept of a communion ambrosia

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:14.700
that that is a substance that will give you uh ionic life

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:21.720
ionic life you see how the mystery is set up it is the ambrosia

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:29.039
that makes the poison poorer poorer who she is let's go back all right following

00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:35.400
we're following the first Christ people go ahead under the ambrosia

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:42.480
um yeah one more here's her here's her uh title and I

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:49.980
just want you to notice what she does she's involved in Partition right goddess of childbirth you will be under

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:56.280
the influence when you come to the place that you will be giving you

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:03.179
take it down that you will be giving your child to the world when it comes to that time you will be

00:24:03.179 --> 00:24:10.020
given a drug that will put you into a state where your delivery will be your

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:17.220
orgia yes it will be that orgasmos the

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:23.220
introduction of life into the world do you see how the orgasmos works

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:30.000
it is a death it is a death in which we enter

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:37.740
only to come to life that is the mystery

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:43.440
and if you're surprised that this mystery is pioneered by a

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:52.679
goddess who is the goddess of childbirth it's because you have not yet been informed

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:57.960
that we are all meeting the Creator

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:05.580
and she is not what most of us think she is

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:11.940
now fantastic I love it let's see what else about this goddess let's keep going with

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:19.260
the definitions I just want to give you a little more dirt to kick up in your face yeah here's there here's your

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:25.080
epithet right think of this queen impress who stands there at the Gateway

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:31.200
in the mystery she who guards the way right I'm the way when Jesus was saying

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:38.100
I'm the way he was not the first human being to do so nor was it original nor

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:43.620
was it unknown to the ears of the people hearing it when he was saying I am the

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:50.039
way they knew he is one of those mystery freaks

00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:57.600
involved in his mystery freak sex drug stuff probably associated with prostitutes naked children in public

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:06.240
parks at 4am Mark 14 51 52. 27. I got it in before 30.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:12.980
um so yeah let's keep going a little bit more vocabulary I just want people to enjoy

00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:23.460
um this is what we're really um this is what we the person who is genuine right to to the world

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:31.320
this goddess seems frightening and rightly so to those who were born

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:37.980
again who know these Implements of Bacchus who know these Implements of

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:45.179
Bacchus keeps thinking quantum those are the ones right notice that

00:26:45.179 --> 00:26:52.640
what is Diana doing directly associated with Bacchus

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:58.200
through Medea Diana and Bacchus

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.900
have life the process is bakic worship and for

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:10.080
those of you from Judaism those of you who know the temple those of you who stood at the Wailing

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:18.679
Wall those of you who know what medieval historians teach

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:25.460
it was she who started your rights

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:31.080
your heritage your practice

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.960
goes back to a Bronze Age impress

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:44.360
who brought the voice of God yes and when I say God

00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:50.279
I mean Medea I mean Artemis

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:55.500
yeah I'm in Bacchus fantastic let's go to one more word

00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:01.620
um I think I've got one more after that yep please yep here are the dogs that we're looking

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:09.360
at and I just want you to notice what how what are the association of dogs this is how this

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:30.419
before whoops that was an Astra another one a TIE fighter perhaps

00:28:30.419 --> 00:28:36.200
yeah we good I don't know I need more tea

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.659
who are these skula case you want to know who you know those of you who are

00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:50.340
interested in Magic and I know that you're out there I know you're amassing and a knowledge

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:59.760
and esoteric knowledge that you want to practice instead of just reading and studying about yes yes

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.000
um if you don't find this figure if you don't read these

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.659
signs if you don't break this seal you got nothing

00:29:11.659 --> 00:29:17.640
you know what is that Hound doing that

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:24.659
Hound is guarding the way that Hound has fire in their eyes yeah

00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:32.399
and they possess the madness the madness that comes from the Dark

00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:37.500
Star they possess The Madness of the

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:43.080
lightbringer fantastic what do they call her they

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:49.080
call her lucifera lucifera for those of you who hear

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:54.179
Lucifer you are exactly in the right place

00:29:54.179 --> 00:30:01.340
before there was a Lucifer there was a lucifera

00:30:03.059 --> 00:30:10.860
yeah so you can say that the origins of Judaism Christianity and Islam

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:18.000
are from Satan they are satanic or saturnian or

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.700
saturnan fantastic the Linguistics is just

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:30.020
gorgeous isn't it but your religions that you practice

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:35.179
are all satanic you are following

00:30:35.179 --> 00:30:41.840
Judaism and by that I mean Judaism Islam Christianity

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:50.000
your religions are based on a saturnian

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:58.140
satanic initiation created by a Bronze Age woman

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:04.740
let's bring up that last text I just want to flash this up this treat that I want to bring to you

she's the one who manipulates the stars of the pole and the course of the sun and the stars

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:36.059
the constellations she's the one who does this with her mind it's her

00:33:36.059 --> 00:33:42.539

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:29.700
it makes things living and it makes things dead the power that

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:37.680

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:43.079
cosmos the power to create and Destroy

00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:51.020
