00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:32.759
that's what really counts those two words in parentheses um particularly the second one

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:38.800
mu why because I told everybody everything is coming from the verb in

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:45.080
ancient Greek that's the verb and what is that word what is that verb going to do I'll

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:51.240
show you in second but look here mystery of secret right right mystery the mysteries in the plural and then I want

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.440

butes will be on display it's fantastic

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:23.840
what is who is heraclitus he is a presocratic philosopher who blows people's minds I

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:31.279
told you I told you give him some images make him crazy I told

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:39.360
you that there is this power of ancient

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.560
Greek in the right position which is in your brain

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:54.760
that power can bring itself out in the logos this guy was flying on the logos

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:01.279
remember remember he's the guy who says things that nobody nobody really

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:06.399
understands nobody really understands it's too much heraclitus and you say

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:12.399
wait a minute why am I bringing the Revelation with heraclitus because this

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:20.920
is the place that the theologians can not go they cannot track the

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:27.240
language and that's what we're here to do the Tower of Babel only

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.519
works if Mother Greeks says so a you're going to love it tonight watch this give

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:53.800
at what I do for you look at what I do this is a text from the 19th century

00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:00.640
it's Galen it's Galen look at how beautiful that paper is that paper is a couple hundred years old

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:08.680
you know when that stuff is new it looks just like this oh isn't that gorgeous

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:14.360
look at how it doesn't age it's Immortal baby they made Immortal paper in the

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:20.200
1820s to 40s oh god let's go look at the people I

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:27.200
said mystery right so I wanted to take you a place Dan isn't you know this is just a place that Dan and the Kips of

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.600
the world they can't go because they're training you know it just Falls it just

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:38.160
Falls a little short right you know there are Samurai and there are people who say their

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:45.680
Samurai and how do you know when they get in an arena you can see it's

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:56.120
skill watch this people this is Galen that's in the very middle of the page in that new paragraph he says Al on

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.959
not only is the word Christos or Christ

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:13.800
a drug term but in Antiquity they are so

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:21.279
cheeky that they name powerful compo uh compound

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:28.160
drug the mystery oh my God somebody would tell me some somebody some some

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.920
scholar somewhere ah right on his backside some some

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:42.000
scholar somewhere is going to say e is no association between mystery and

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.880
drugs and you want to squeeze their little heads like this like just like

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:55.040
that right why oh God the gospel is a drug term

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.040
salvation is a drug term

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:10.839
she touched his robe oh God here we go go back to the sources

00:12:10.839 --> 00:12:18.320
bring it up the next one there was your drug formula by the way for those of you greeklings who are

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:25.199
reading and studying I recommend that you go to that text just flash that text

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:30.600
up it's got a recipe for the drug that you call the

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:37.399
mystery oh that's fantastic past the B's Blood let's go you didn't know they had

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:43.959
this kind of stuff did you but they did here's the verb mu to initiate into the Mysteries now I want to make a point

00:12:43.959 --> 00:12:51.320
here Dan mlen the world-renowned um Theologian Bible

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:56.720
scholar um just all around you know

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.519
champion champion you see the plaques on on his walls oh my God he's got

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:10.040
plaques W Dan mlen says Almon merely went to the

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:16.480
bottom of the definition okay now it what does that

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.120
show it shows poor or inadequate training right he's not trying to be

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:29.600
this way he's being this way because his trainers didn't have the skill level with the language that they could raise

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.959
him up to the level that he can use a basic tool like a classical Greek

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:44.360
Lexicon yeah so if you track the word through this passage you see how it's set up all in blue you've got all the

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:50.000
Greek and blue who are the mysteries about gives you all the different Mysteries and all the different contexts

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.240
that you've got and then you get to definition number two and says generally to teach or instruct now if I jump down

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:02.160
and I choose definition number two it's it's not because that has nothing to do

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:08.639
with the rest of the word if you track these passages you will see what does it

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:15.399
mean to Mu yeah it does mean to educate to

00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:25.120
instruct to a level during an initiation yes yes Dan the fact that

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:31.360
it's the bottom has nothing to do with it right the idea of the initiation and

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:39.279
instruction we are pulling those out artificially when you say Christ you say

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:45.040
apply a drug drug application it's what you're

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:54.120
saying it doesn't matter that you can't recognize it Dan it's still in the word

00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:01.880
roots Roots have power and what these great great the the classical Lexica

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:11.000
that have been uh edited you don't say written you say edited those are fantastic now if you go um if you go

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.920
online and you try to pull down a a um lexicon of the New Testament you are

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:24.279
going to find the most deranged laughable

00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:31.959
jokery those definitions are going to be sizzling with the spice of Theology and

00:15:31.959 --> 00:15:39.680
they're not going to be good Lexica you don't need the scholar interfering with

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.040
the evidence we're just investigators and when you walk in that crime scene as

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:51.319
a theologian you urinate all over the floor do you know what you just did you

00:15:51.319 --> 00:15:57.279
just destroyed all our DNA evidence you bonee head nice job it's contaminated

00:15:57.279 --> 00:16:02.319
the whole scene is contaminated no court in the country would take this evidence

00:16:02.319 --> 00:16:07.880
that is what Judaism Christianity

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:13.160
did to classical history and it's

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:18.920
why um uh Julian the emperor said who we

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:26.639
call the apostate right it's why Julian the emperor said you can't allow the monis

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:33.519
to do this to your education right to all of your writings

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:41.880
they are actively burning down libraries one of the things people don't realize is that mons like Christians in the

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:47.240
early in their earliest stages um one of the activities that they did on a

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:53.759
regular basis was burn down libraries burn down

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:59.680

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:39.600
yeah okay give me the next go to the next one the next one's the gift this is just um he's explaining who he is that's

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:46.080
nice um thank you very much here's the gift are you ready this is what's unique

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:53.159
and this is something that Christians will not understand about their own text

00:19:53.159 --> 00:20:00.280
right this is why if you talk to a modern-day Christian doesn't matter if Protestant or Catholic doesn't matter if

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:06.520
it's Evangelical or Methodist it doesn't matter um you talk to them

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:12.480
about this and they will give you a distortion this laughably bad because

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:19.840
they they're working off King James and newer International Version they're working off Anglo-Saxon crappy that's

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:25.320
the problem and here's the secret I'm going to give you a secret about seminarians okay take this down and

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:34.159
brainwash and then we'll bring it back um when I worked in seminary I picked up

00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:39.360
certain ways I picked up the Vibes of the way

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:46.080
that theologians Bible study Scholars the way that you know pastors and Priests I

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:53.240
picked up a a way that they follow and one of the ways they follow

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:59.200
is they say that they use Greek but they don't that's number one

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:09.000
number two they rely upon faith and you say well no no you know yeah wake up um

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.080
they rely upon faith when they're exercising their reason when they are

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:20.880
reading ATT text they use a theological filter to see the

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.960
words and what I did as a as a seminary

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:32.600
instructor is um is to take off those those blindfolds to take off those

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:38.120
glasses those Rose Colored GL theological colored glasses you know

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:44.679
it's not a pretty thing at all but it taints so here we're getting the raw

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:51.960
naked text tonight that's what classes do it's like an autopsy right we're not there to bond

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.679
with the corps we're there to figure out what happened to it right if I am a if I

00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:05.400
am a monest the logos the logos is that

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:11.080
text do you see in Antiquity in the in the original mystery religions that

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.159
preceded Christianity from which Christianity developed and used all of

00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:21.799
their vocabulary words like Christ words like gospel words like

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:29.520
salvation in all of those earlier in all of those earlier forms

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:34.600
of uh the mystery the terms are being

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:40.720
set right when we get a Christ we know what that Christ is it's not like people would look at you when Jesus walks

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.960
around he's the Christ right here in the be opening of the Apocalypse it's The

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:54.159
Apocalypse of the Christ it's not like we people would scratch scratch your head and say what what is that what is

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:59.360
that right everybody knows what that is the theologian

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.720
can't see those realities because over his

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:11.640
vision and I have known one female Theologian but she was quite reasonable

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:22.640
um typically over a theologian Man's eyes are this Pride this excessive

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.919
smugness and here's the secret that can pop their reality they really don't work

00:23:28.919 --> 00:23:34.080
with the evidence they really don't and when you bring the evidence to them it's

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:40.039
um it's you know embarrassing it's embarrassing and I learned this I

00:23:40.039 --> 00:23:46.039
learned about this defense this theology never get into an argument satanic

00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:51.400
congregation don't get into an argument they mean nothing and they will

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:57.000

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:05.360

I've given them the hope of Christ and the Redemption of the blood of Christ I

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:22.480
have shown them that I have caused tears do you know what it's like to suck the

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:28.720

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:43.360
from somebody's mouth and their mouth is

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:50.279
aatu Right their sto is a it's got wait is that the root

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:59.840
for Athena yes it is is the root for Athena and what is that Immortal mouth

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:07.480
that deathless mouth it is that which breathe the spirit

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:20.159
op that is the Divine mouth of she who founded the Mysteries this text that I

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:26.559
just showed you is pindar now remember according to the pastors the preachers

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:32.919
the theologians the teachers you cannot take what a Greek does and apply

00:29:32.919 --> 00:29:38.640
it to what a Christian does why because they live in

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:45.640
bubbles history according to monest

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:52.440
teaching is a fairy tale where some people live in bubbles that keep them

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:58.440
insulated from everything around them and that's how the that's how life is and that's too bad if you don't

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:05.880
understand that uh faith faith faith faith faith right here's your unfortunate reality your unfortunate

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:13.640
reality is that the language can't sustain that language is

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:20.519
universal the forces that are acting on language they don't care that your neighbor is a different religion they

00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:25.840
don't care yeah that's why language through

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:32.200
science overpowers all all of your BS oh can you feel it tonight people

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:39.360
feel that this is a temple of Reason baby this is a temple of reason those words that I just showed

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:47.240
you that's what comes out of the Founder's mouth who is the first

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:54.720
Christ she was a woman they called her media the root is to heal of her very

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.919
name to heal and to rule

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:07.000

takes a lot of a lot of her time to bring you these gorgeous gorgeous images

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.360
and they all of course are packed you know with the the the goods do you know

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:32.360
what this says this is the divine Divine logos the Divine

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.799
word of media right this is that epos now when

00:31:37.799 --> 00:31:44.919
you take the word logos and the Christians say it means word word word word right it means reason it means

00:31:44.919 --> 00:31:50.600
accounting it means a reckoning right and it means

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:57.519
word and you say wait a minute Dan said if I pick one of these later definitions

00:31:57.519 --> 00:32:05.159
I'm off you mean one Greek word can mean word and reason and Reckoning all at the

00:32:05.159 --> 00:32:13.240
same time yes now for those of you who are growing take those three concepts

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.679
from your anglosaxon brain use the

00:32:18.679 --> 00:32:24.360
force there we go um take those

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:29.519
Concepts and put them together word

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:37.279
yeah word you got it you understand word now take reason and combine word and

00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:43.279
reason what kind of Offspring do you get from word and reason now take that

00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:50.679
Offspring and combine that with Reckoning Reckoning as in an accounting

00:32:50.679 --> 00:32:55.720
of something reckon Your Existence

00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:01.000
logos do you know where this stuff is coming from when John says in the

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.799
beginning was the logos it's coming from this guy

00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:13.320
heraclitus yeah among others he's one of the people who bats it around Who

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:20.399
develops the context uh I mean the the content of the word as it

00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:27.960
grows imagine that now you cannot do this with Hebrew right the level that

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:37.080
you have got ancient Hebrew for those of you ancient Hebrew with its 8,000 words is compared to Greek with 1.5 milon now

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:44.919
estimated by the tlg holy Ma you can't get to this level that

00:33:44.919 --> 00:33:50.519
you've got reason you've got accounting there's just not enough elements right

00:33:50.519 --> 00:33:57.840
there's not enough balls and sticks to put together the molecules that you need complex molecules if you only have 8

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:05.200
th000 basic units you can't do anything with that I'm telling you a third grader has a 3,00 I mean a three-year-old has a

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:10.800
3,000 word capacity right 8,000 words is like his

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.760
his big sister right maybe she's in the fourth fifth grade maybe I don't know I

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:23.158
wouldn't put I don't know if I put her that eye have you seen that stuff and don't think that it's just an artifact

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:31.878
of ancient Hebrew the osin and the umbre are the same way Gilgamesh is the same way everybody oh the Epic of gilgames

00:34:31.879 --> 00:34:37.599

and will be now you thought you Christians you thought okay this is ours

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:50.920

00:42:57.559 --> 00:43:03.280
he speaks right and what happens oh I'm

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:10.760
sorry I'm sorry he doesn't speak and he doesn't hide but he

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:17.760
Saye he signifies he seals he seals and signifies that's what

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:25.000
the lord of the Oracle does and remember the first Jewish religious

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.160
structure is A tes Aran it's an oracle

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:38.800
producing tent this is talking about the origins of everything that is

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:45.640
Judaism everything and in turn what Christianity

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:52.680
developed marvelous did you know Judaism and Christianity I don't know if Judaism and Christianity would like to be would

00:43:52.680 --> 00:44:00.160
like to know this about themselves but they were born from the same name

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:06.520
parents isn't that neat isn't that neat I don't know if everybody would like

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:12.920
that or not but um whether you like it or not they're codependent right and when we have

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:18.200
people translating Greek texts into Hebrew just to say we've got original

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:26.000
Hebrew text the Christians have to prop that up right or else they both fall short right

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.240
and the pagans were just just no just

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:39.599
whatever don't try to tear that on the government we don't care give me the next one um boom lastly

00:44:39.599 --> 00:44:45.599
what is he oh no there was the there was a message in that there we go watch this what does Plutarch say plutarch's the

00:44:45.599 --> 00:44:50.680
priest by the way what are you Apollo you're one who

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:57.280
neither speaks nor do you hide but you signify

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:03.280
you seal now watch this go to the next one why does that matter you think oh

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:09.200
this stuff is not there oh before we get there one more one more we'll see the signify in a second but Watch What

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:15.640
Happens I'm just going to translate this for the one and you see the two daggers in that first line after the number six

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:23.800
those two daggers mean there something Goofy and it's a little bit hard to um to translate it right but there for the

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:30.559
one who is they will be raised again to become

00:45:30.559 --> 00:45:36.000
guardians Guardians of the living and of

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:43.079
the Dead oh okay that was heraclitus people if

00:45:43.079 --> 00:45:48.240
you want to understand the apocalypse and you have not read presocratic

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:55.800
philosophy you're going to miss maybe 60% of the vocabulary right away you're

00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:04.160
not even going to know what that vocabulary is for we are squarely sitting in a mystery initiation we're in

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:10.960
the cult and these words this is the evidence of the crime scene let's do it

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:18.559
let's do it it's too bad the theologians don't ever catch up but they don't typically they don't um it's the faith

00:46:18.559 --> 00:46:24.720
thing right it's the same reason sisters of frustration never become

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:33.160
fulfilled it's the faith it's the faith and you do it because of your fear

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:39.960
you are afraid of hell but watch what's GNA happen to hell

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:47.880
I'll show you what we're going to do to hell are you ready give me the next one watch this and uh uh um witness yeah who

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:53.160
who is just Jesus Christ look at the second line he's that firstborn what is

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:58.760
he the firstborn of now you think about that he's the first born of God right no

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:06.200
no he's not he's not theologically that may match what you like but he is not he

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:12.400
is the only born of

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:19.839
God am I reaching not yet it'll come it'll come

00:47:19.839 --> 00:47:25.319
we'll get there um sorry did you set that when you can't okay let's go what

00:47:25.319 --> 00:47:31.839
is he he's the firstborn necron the you hear you know necro in

00:47:31.839 --> 00:47:37.359
there and you know it has to do with dead necrofilia man necron are corpses

00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:45.280
right people who have deceased who have died he's the firstborn of the Dead did

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:52.599
you know that was Jesus Christ's title it was his cult title firstborn of the

00:47:52.599 --> 00:48:00.400
dead of course he had to resurrect right cuz he's the the firstborn of the

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:06.400
dead and what else king of these Kings Ryan of course he is give me the next

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:13.720
one that word that word is very important and you cannot dismiss it and

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:20.599
say oh the Cults are using the same terms uh but the Christians H

00:48:20.599 --> 00:48:27.640
something's different you know think about Christianity this way this is how Christians see their own history right

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:34.559
um gas woke up one morning and went and listened to a preacher and maybe it was

00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:40.119
Peter right right after he killed ananas and Safar for their money and he's sitting out there listening to them and

00:48:40.119 --> 00:48:46.319
he's like oh this stuff really makes sense and I don't want to go to hell so

00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:53.280
I'm gonna I'm gonna follow this to wherever it goes now all of my words are

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:59.799
not going to be what they were before I am not going to use Pagan ideas

00:48:59.799 --> 00:49:05.280
I am not going to use Pagan words magically I am going to speak

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:10.520
those Pagan words but they will have Christian meanings because of my

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:15.599
faith is that what you want you want Faith here come here come here you're

00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:20.240
going to hell you're going to

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:27.839
[Music] hell what's happening

00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:35.160
give me the next one I think I've taken us into a different place is there a dimensional Rift somewhere in

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:43.799
here and what if we now we're priests man we are priests glory and power into

00:49:43.799 --> 00:49:49.920
the ions of ions says the Christian into

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:58.359
the ions of the ions do you even know what that means do you think the person sitting there in church this

00:49:58.359 --> 00:50:05.440

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:30.599
what the expression does Dan I challenge you I challenge you Dan what does it mean into the ions of

00:50:30.599 --> 00:50:38.000
ions Dan will say from his Seminary training oh that's the word for Eternal

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:46.280
like eternal life Dan Dan and all you theologians out

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:51.920

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:57.960
into the eternities can you really have a plural etern

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:04.520
ET isn't eternity already everything how can you have two

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:09.599
everything isn't the one everything also the other

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:16.559
everything when you say eternal life when you walk into that church today and that preacher is up there that

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:22.799
misogynous guy is up there and he's like oh you need to repent you need to repent

me right um that person do you think that person really understands the

00:51:49.920 --> 00:52:00.319
concept of a plurality of ion I don't think so but you as an

00:52:00.319 --> 00:52:05.480
initiate you have ionic Vision you know

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:12.920

you Di adoris who by the way is is about a hundred years before

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:38.599
Jesus yeah so the terminology is there and he's referring to the first Christ

00:52:38.599 --> 00:52:47.440
and it turns out it's the woman who gave us salvation whose name means

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:55.400
medicine yeah she is the Prototype and that's why Jesus is now wearing her

00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:00.400
golden bra do you

00:53:00.599 --> 00:53:06.160
see the monism of Judaism and the monism

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:15.079
of Christianity are Replacements of a sacred feminine

00:53:15.079 --> 00:53:23.520
voice I'll say that one more time the monism of Judaism the monism of

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:31.559
Christianity are the direct off spring of Lady

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:37.400
Babylon now you understand why they don't want to come out of the closet now

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:45.480

have to exist in this zone of Bless yeah this is into the I ions of

00:54:16.559 --> 00:54:23.920
ions let's go on people are like you know what I need a climax here I need some kind of Crescendo to something that

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:30.480
oh we got the purple bag give it to me hey pay attention he's coming in the

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:35.880
clouds now that's what you know people would say what the it's a kind of a nice

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:42.040
picture they'll draw it with Jesus and he's W he's in the clouds right and he's coming it doesn't

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:49.319
say in the clouds though it says with the clouds says with the clouds in all fairness I'll let you theologians figure

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:57.520
that out but when you're surrounded by clouds every eye can see him

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:03.520
and especially those who pricked him who

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:08.839
wait what those who pricked them they the um people theologians will say oh

00:55:08.839 --> 00:55:14.240
it's referring to crucifixion no it's not no it's not there's no crucifixion

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:19.720
in this word there is no crucifixion give me the next one give me the next

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:25.640
one there is no crucifixion in this word what is in it oh here's the clouds here's the clouds let's go on from the

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:31.480
clouds look look at that the bottom one is nice the alchemical sublimate isn't that neat call those clouds ah it

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:36.520
doesn't matter here is the verb that it's from people K and it's just got an

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:41.960
intensifier on the front of it so it's like really really K and what do you do

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:47.640
when you kto something you sting it you sting it do you remember Paul what does

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:55.720
Paul have he's got that stinging in his socks Oh My Flesh Pastor please Jesus

00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:01.200
Christ save me save me Pastor from this stinging

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:07.720
flesh he asked God three times give it to me this dude Paul who

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:15.559
is immune to Viper ventim ask God three times please don't let me continue to do

00:56:15.559 --> 00:56:26.640
this and God said to him shut up my grace is sufficient my strength

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:35.880
multiplied in weakness AA is the word in Greek in

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:43.039
weakness when you go under you will find

00:56:43.039 --> 00:56:52.440
AA you will be unable to move and this is necessary to bring you to

00:56:54.599 --> 00:57:00.280
death do you see why why God allowed Paul to

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:07.520
continue There was a great City in Antiquity called

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:13.039
thieves some of the some of the best things in the world came out of

00:57:13.039 --> 00:57:20.079

the teeth of the Dragon the teeth of the Dragon the teeth

00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:05.480
of the Dragon are what you need to enter into the mystery you must be stung and

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:13.440
that is why Yahoo's grace is sufficient please please Yahoo take this

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:22.720
away from me take this boy cup away from me nevertheless not my will but yours be

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:28.000
done that city was founded through those practices that

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:34.160
involved the Seven Stars that I hold in my

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:42.760
hand right if you are ever if you are ever on

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:47.960
the verge of death hold up the

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:56.760
serpent raise up the serpent undertake the work of the serpent

00:58:57.799 --> 00:59:03.000
you'll drink that death inducer says Jesus and

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.440
it will do nothing to you do you know what Jesus the one product was that

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:15.760
Jesus Christ endorsed in the Bible it's not any sort of Chariot it's

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:23.400
not any sort of accounting Abacus it's not any sort of drugs that

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:33.119
you can buy in the Roman marketplace the one thing he endorsed was a drug

00:59:33.119 --> 00:59:39.720
that only the mystery initiates will have experienced these are people who

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:47.160
were born again and Jesus Christ said you will use these drugs and they will

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:53.920
not hurt you okay what are you doing if you come over to my place and I've got

00:59:53.920 --> 01:00:03.079
my 12 children and we're doing our initiations oh Apostles or children right um students M time anyway um I say

01:00:03.079 --> 01:00:08.680
children they can be teenagers too so um you know somewhere in that range

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:15.640
students and um if I'm there with my 12 students maybe I'm washing their feet so

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:22.240
I've already taken off my clothes and um the little towel that I wrapped around my private parts I'm

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:28.799
going to as I wash the foot and then dry it I'm going to take that towel off and I'm going to wash that foot right in

01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:36.319
front of myself totally totally naked right what's John looking at while you're washing his

01:00:36.319 --> 01:00:42.559
foot you'll ask yourself the question have these people done

01:00:42.559 --> 01:00:52.480
it and the answer is the ones that are born again have been sunk in death and

01:00:52.480 --> 01:01:01.960
resurrected those are the TR True Believers those are the true um if

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:07.520
you're not willing to enter into death and

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:13.119
Resurrection um you're never going to make it through the right you're you're never going to make it there's too much

01:01:13.119 --> 01:01:20.319
fear involved there if you fear for your life that much you're not going to be able to do this yeah unless we hold you

01:01:20.319 --> 01:01:25.720
down and do it forcefully to you but you know although you could argue they're

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:31.960
doing doing that at the cave of tronus and because they just drop you in there and then you're around the snakes

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:39.599
and you're on the hallucina JY and you know next thing you know you're screaming there's no way out it's totally pitch black dark You could argue

01:01:39.599 --> 01:01:47.240
that that's really not voluntary kind of but you have to be willing if you are

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:53.279
a Christian and you love Jesus Christ you'll love the christing you'll

01:01:53.279 --> 01:01:59.720
understand what it is and you'll follow that what we have today with theology

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:07.039
the apocalypse tonight is showing us we don't have what we used to this is not

01:02:07.039 --> 01:02:15.319
Christianity is not the mystery religion it once was Judaism is not the religious

01:02:15.319 --> 01:02:21.799
mystery that it once was yeah

01:02:21.799 --> 01:02:32.359
yeah we have to reconcile the fact that our conceptions of our own past are not the

01:02:32.359 --> 01:02:40.799
reality this is the mystery for you to look into that mirror and for you to see

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:47.000
I am not what I thought I was you're a

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:57.079
wake and unafraid that's what they used to say about it this person now who's been initiated is awake and unafraid

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:03.319
God is that gorgeous give me the next one we need to we need to um touch off

01:03:03.319 --> 01:03:09.200
here people people are like oh my God the taxes are endless let's finish up

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:16.720
right okay um skip this one I want to go quick this is the yep there's the biting and I I just want yep fine that's the

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:24.000
stinging right the stinging um here's some bees and wasp for you that's great give me the next one um it also what is

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.960
that stinging associated with P which means to in and what does it mean to in why did

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:39.440
they translate this into Latin because they were um Victorian prudes and to in

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.760
literally means to go into um to enter into someone you know

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:50.200
what I'm talking about um to co to enter into it

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:56.799
together right as a as a pair right look who it refers to right away we get

01:03:56.799 --> 01:04:02.640
Aristophanes right oh that's nice passively it's used of the woman are we

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:09.319
getting closer right do you understand where that sting comes from do you

01:04:09.319 --> 01:04:15.480
understand right okay I've been stung let's get it let's get it that's

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:22.359
literally what it says and here's Paul I just want to skip to the end here's I notice on the third line down angulos

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:28.240
satana who is Paul when Paul is doing his drugs he's on the Venom and he's got

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:34.160
the star what does he do what what happens he's entering into a place where

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.440
he gets an Angelos and the the the the title of

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:45.640
these angoy is p

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:51.760
p who's this one sat who's Paul call who's Paul's personal Angel you didn't

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:57.640
know this you didn't know Satan was Paul's personal angel

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:05.960
when he said he got to the third heaven and he was like oh I don't know if it was actually there or not

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:11.480
right right I don't know whether it was just an illusion or or whether it was a

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:17.440
reality I don't know whether I was physically there I don't know right people listen to Paul the Apostle and

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:24.200
they they talk about him like he's the biggest brain on the planet let me tell you something you put Paul the Apostle

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:29.279
next to an EP minute and he's going to crush him they both quoted the same thing by the way they

01:05:29.279 --> 01:05:36.920
both quoted media both Paul and epines quoted media all katans are liars

01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:46.160
right he couldn't hold a candle Paul couldn't hold a candle you remember what he said he said I was in that

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:55.760
state I don't know if I was in my body but I was in that heaven right

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:02.839
right whatever level that he went to because there's different levels and you look at me you be like that's now first

01:06:02.839 --> 01:06:09.640
of all the the the person of faith will say h I can see how that could be the person

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:16.440
of not Faith would be like what the hell does that mean right what do you mean there's different levels apparently

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:23.760
apparently when you go through the death process and are brought back by these drugs apparently you can access and see

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:29.920
the structure there's a divine structur to the cosmos ruled by

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:37.799
diones oh my God are you kidding me no and he's talking about that Vision

01:06:37.799 --> 01:06:45.359
people used to say you mean there's drugs in the New Testament oh my god um where are there not drugs when you're

01:06:45.359 --> 01:06:53.720
using a term like Christ which is a drug term Paul is going up dude that guy's

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:59.599
they noticed this dude is is is um by the way this is the perfect question to

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:06.960
ask next time you're with one of your one of your um monest friends you know

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:12.160
and maybe they start talking about praise this and praise that um ask them

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:17.920
why is Paul immune to Venom immune to snake venom is there something funny why

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:23.240
is Jesus telling people hey you can use Venom and it won't hurt you are you guys

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:29.760
