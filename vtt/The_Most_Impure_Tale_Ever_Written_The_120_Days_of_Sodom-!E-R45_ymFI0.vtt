00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.679
we all have our favorite artists whether they paint direct write act or all of the above there are certain types of

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:14.440
artists that appeal to us in a way that Inspire Devotion to their every move in their chosen field you don't necessarily

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.320
have to like every move they make sometimes the artist makes a misstep a Bad album movie book whatever but it

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.160
doesn't necessarily knock them down from the pedestal you had place them on however sometimes an artist's misstep

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.160
can amount to much greater consequences than a bad review sometimes the misstep is off a cliff in recent times the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.239
exposing of degenerate acts by prominent figures has become a frequent occurrence I can think of many high-profile celebs

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.360
within the last year that have been shown to Harbor more Sinister desires than their overly friendly face and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.879
demeanor would lead you to believe artists are no different I'm sure the majority watching us discovered

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.160
something undesirable about their favorite painter director writer actor or musician at some point but that is

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.239
when you are led to the age-old question that must be pondered in such a scenario as this do you or do you not separate

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.880
the art from the artist I would have to assume that separating the art from the artist is

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.759
the more common approach but sometimes an artist's views and or actions for good or ill are so intwined within their

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.680
work that separating their paintings movies books or albums from themselves is impossible and nowhere is separating

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.439
the art from the Artist as impossible to do as it is with the Maris dard and particularly in it infamously disturbing

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:37.320
Tale the 120 days of Sodom the 120 days of Sodom is even in today's standards a

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.119
hard read but this is not because of Any intellectual grandiosity or any lack of entertainment it is purely down to the

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.320
fact that the content included within the tale is so brutal that reading it will make you feel like you're on some

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.600
watch list and who better to write such a disturbing tale than a man who spent 32 of his 74 years behind the bars of

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.840
jails and mental asylums narrowly avoided the guillotine multiple times was burnt in effigy and who was the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.840
inspiration behind the term sadism that was the Maris dad a man who was reviled

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.000
for his actions and his art thus the tale of the 120 days of Sodom cannot be

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.720
told without the tale of sad to preface this story I could hit you with words like disturbing Sinister unsettling

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.800
frightening sadistic Etc to get a general overview of what's to come from

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.360
both the tale and his life however sometimes it is easier to let the artist speak for himself as whilst this quote

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.800
from sad may have originally been intended for 120 days it also neatly sums up the man's life as he described

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.239
120 days as the most impure tale ever written since the world

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.720
began dontine alons franois desad was born on the 2nd of June 1740 in Paris

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.760
France born into an aristocratic family related to the Royal House of Kai sad was given an immediate leg up in life

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.920
due to his family's wealth and connections to be born into a position of immense privilege would for any

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.879
normal child be nothing but an advantage however due to s's inclinations towards Hedonism and violence the immediate

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:17.480
power only acted to encourage sard's darker side the first sign of sad psychotic side would reveal itself early

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.280
in his life in 1744 at the age of four sard had brutally attacked a playmate of

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.519
his for reasons that are unknown due to the attack sard's father Jee Baptist

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.840
Joseph franois otherwise known as the K desad sent sad to go and live with his

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.400
uncle who tooted him until he was 10 years old despite his father's good intentions sad reportedly grew worse

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.840
under the care of his uncle as his uncle often left him to the devices of servants who had no authority to

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.519
properly discipline him ands surprisingly zad's capacity for entitlement and fits of Rage only

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.439
increased from the time spent in his uncle's care after 6 years of being tutored by his uncle sad was sent to

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.879
attend a prestigious school called the L Lou L Grand in 1750 the school proved to

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:08.439
be a pivotal element to sard's development as it was at the school where sad grew a love for theater

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:15.480
literature and flagellation sad would routinely be disciplined by teachers for his unruly conduct in classrooms as you

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.479
can imagine s's violent tendencies had not quelled one bit upon leaving his uncles and entering the school and so he

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.680
often found himself fighting students and causing General Mayhem whilst in class to combat his behavior the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.440
teachers had attempted to deal with sad in the best way they knew how flatulation unfortunately for them they

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.960
had not extinguished a flame they had instead stoked A Fire Within sad left

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.280
school in 1754 to pursue a career in the French military which saw him participate in the Seven Years War which

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.960
took place between 1756 to 1763 when not on duty SAA spend his time

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.840
in promiscuous Pursuits as well as gambling his father the comp Dad could see his son going down a dark path and

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.600
decided to set up about finding an affluent wife for his son to help secure him financially and to prevent him from

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.080
his promiscuity s was thus married on the 17th of May 1763 within the same

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.440
year sad was discharged from the military and moved back to Paris with his new wife once again Assad's father's

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.039
attempts to help his son had proven to be useless Assad would continue to sleep with multiple women whilst married it

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:28.520
was in the same year as his marriage that the first of many sex scandals of sard's life would take place on the 18th

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.440
of October 17 1963 sad invited a prostitute called Jee testad to one of his properties in Paris the following

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.199
morning testad was running for the police according to testad saded locked her in his house and made her join him

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:47.720
in committing sexual acts on religious artifacts as well as breaking them sard threatened testad with a pistol and

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:55.199
sword sad was thus arrested however he was not arrested because of his abuse and imprisonment of testad no instead s

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.919
was arrested due to his Blasphemous statements and sexual conduct with the religious AR artifacts he was placed in

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:07.199
the chatow Deen fortunately for sad this arrest would only last until the 13th of November as he had the backing of his

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:13.960
mother-in-law Madame de Montiel who excused s's Blasphemous acts and apologized on his behalf sad was thus

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.800
free yet despite this brush with the law sad picked up right where he left off sad would continue to sleep with many

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.160
women of the night and he would spend the other portion of his waking days traveling around France plunging further

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:33.199
into debt hosting parties and engaging in scandalous behavior on the 4 of January 1767 sard's father passed away

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:39.319
and sad inherited the name of con thead for an unknown reason sad still preferred to be called the Marquee in

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:45.080
the same year on the 27th of August sard's first child was born the following year sad would once again be

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.840
embroiled in another Scandal yet this one would prove to be far more public the Scandal would infamously be coined

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.440
the rose Keller affair on the 3rd of April 1768 on Easter Sunday sad hired a

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.840
beggar on the streets of Paris to clean one of his properties the beggar was Rose Keller a widow to a baker and

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.720
herself a cotton spinner due to a lack of funds Keller had resorted to begging on the street and some allege

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.400
prostitution knowing s's less than innocent history concerning the bringing back of women to his properties it will

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.400
come as no surprise to the viewer to hear that sard's intentions with Keller far exceeded the cleaning of his house

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.720
according to Keller's police statement sad had assaulted her abused her and locked her up fortunately Kella had

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:32.240
managed to escape sard's house she relayed her experience to not just the authorities but the locals as well sad

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.520
was once again arrested and was placed in prison for 6 weeks once again sard's mother-in-law helped him get out due to

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.240
public backlash sad was forced to leave Paris upon being released the rose Keller affair would become the first of

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:50.039
many public scandals as the story was printed in newspapers all over Europe sad would thus be given a taste of the

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:55.240
image that would only be further reinforced for years to come the following year 1769 saw the birth of

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.919
sard's Second Son fatherhood did not come before sard's desires however as he found himself involved in yet another

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:06.000
public Scandal 3 years later in 1772 this one would be known as the mar

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.720
affair on the 27th of June 1772 sard and his trusty valet Lor traveled to the

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.919
city of maray on business ever the pleasure Seeker is our protagonist once the day's deals were done sad ordered

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:25.080
Lor to round up four prostitutes as an Ori is commonly the best way to get the field for a new city and so Lor did just

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.599
that and he found four women ranging between the ages of 18 to 23 that night the six of them engaged in a matless

00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:37.440
game of Twister that included flagellation Blasphemous acts on religious artifacts and sodomy both

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.880
heterosexual and homosexual sard and Lor had also given the women homemade sweets that were made from a popular

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.399
aphrodesiac at the time called Spanish Fly the sweets had thus been issued to add a little more pep in the step of all

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:54.600
involved but unfortunately it mostly acted to make two of the women Gravely ill the entire incident was thus

00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:00.519
reported to the police and sad and lur were charged with poisoning and sodomy two charges that gifted the two men with

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:06.640
a death sentence luckily for them the two men fled to Italy before being captured and effes of sad and lur were

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:12.720
burnt in their place despite the widespread Scandal 1772 was also the year sad started a relationship with his

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.240
sister-in-law due to this sads once loyal mother-in-law became enraged and finan sads arrest gave the authorities

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:25.640
details of his whereabouts and done a complete flip from devout sad supporter to Devout sad hater sad was thus

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:32.360
arrested on the 8th of December 1772 and was placed in the Fortress of Malone sad ever the slippery customer escaped

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:38.839
incarceration in 1773 and stayed in hiding at his Chateau in lacost invigorated by his freedom sad returned

00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:44.640
to business as usual resulting in yet another public Scandal a scandal far darker than those previously as it

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.360
included the abuse of miners along with the help of sard's wife the Scandal was known as the lacost affair and included

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:57.040
the Abduction of one male minor and five female miners the affair took place in late 1774 to early

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:03.000
1775 sard and his wife had a abused the miners physically and sexually thankfully the parents of the children

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.600
filed charges against sad and by July 1775 he had fled once again to Italy sad

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:14.760
would returned to Lost in June of 1776 and would continue with his old ways once again sad was hiring servants with

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:20.680
the intention of Performing sodomy orgies and sexual abuse however sard's time of Freedom would soon come to an

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.920
end after hearing of his mother's death sad alongside his wife traveled to Paris

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:32.079
once he arrived he was arrested and incarcerated in Vel sad managed to escape on route to court hearings yet

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:38.760
was finally arrested for good in August of 1778 and by September 7th was put back in theen where he would remain for

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:45.079
6 years it is worth noting at this point

00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:51.200
in this perverted tale that sad considered himself to be a literary man often in the tale of sad we are told

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.920
about his extensive writing whilst incarcerated was that is true and it's ground I will be covering shortly it is

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:03.320
also worth noting that between scandals s wrote copious amounts of letters short stories and travel novels which would be

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:09.000
published years after his death but regardless of this it seemed like an extended stint in prison forced sad to

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.880
pump all of the energy that would otherwise be used in orgies into his writing sad thus began writing as soon

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.920
as he was in jail and by July 1782 had completed dialogue between a priest and

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.920
a dying man he had written the book out in a notebook and kept it hidden in his cell sad would then begin planning his

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:32.040
next big novel in late February 1784 sad was transferred from ven to the basti it

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.760
was here where sad would begin writing the manuscript for the tale he had been ruminating on for 2 years sad would

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.839
feverishly pen the tail on a 12 M long scroll he began on the 22nd of October

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:48.959
1785 and wrote over 1, 500 words within the next 37 days when not writing the

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:56.000
scroll would lay tightly rolled and squeezed into a crevice in the wall of his cell through fear of having it confiscated sad would continue working

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.240
on perverse novels in his cell H up in the Bas steel until July 3rd 1789 when he was woken up in the middle of the

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:08.880
night and dragged from his cell leaving his writing and most importantly his scroll behind the day prior sad had been

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:14.760
shouting out his window at a crowd below and saying that guards were killing inmates sard's actions incited a riot

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.279
and for that he was sent to a mental asylum in sharington whilst in the Asylum sad sent letters to his wife

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:26.480
begging her to retrieve his writing and the scroll unfortunately by the time s's wife arrived at the Basel it had gone up

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:33.360
in Flames as the French Revolution had begun days before sad was distraught at the news and was said to have wept Tears

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:40.880
of Blood his Masterpiece had been read by nobody but himself and was now gone the 12 met scroll had perished sad would

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:47.040
live the rest of his life with the belief that his best work had gone down with the best

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.120
still I advise the over modest to lay my book aside at once if he would not be

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.560
scandalized for it is already clear there's not much of the chaste in our plan plan and we dare hold ourselves

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:07.240
answerable in advance that there will be still less in the execution and now friend reader you must prepare your

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:13.320
heart and your mind for the most impure tale that has ever been told since our world began a book the likes of which

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.440
are met with neither amongst the Ancients nor amongst us moderns the 120

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:24.160
days of Sodom is a story about four Libertines who enslave a Haram of boys and girls some of them their own

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:31.120
children for the purposes of physical and sexual torture the four Libertines are all Society men we have a Duke the

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.240
Duke de blang a bishop the Duke's brother referred to as the bishop of x a

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:42.760
judge the president deerville and a banker DEET The Libertines and their victims spend the tail locked up in a

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:48.839
chatau located in a black forest along with them are four prostitutes who tell stories of their careers to rile up and

00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:55.199
Inspire The Libertines the tale is broken up into an introduction and four parts the introduction introduces us to

00:13:55.199 --> 00:14:01.079
the four Libertines and gives us some insight into their degenerate backstory as well as their physical attributes the

00:14:01.079 --> 00:14:08.000
first man we are introduced to is the Duke aged 50 the Duke is described as an imposing figure he is of average height

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.360
has a strong build possesses a masculine countenance and has a Charming way about him that conceals the depravity of his

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:20.680
true self to obtain his wealth we are told that the Duke was born into it however to obtain even more he killed

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:26.440
his mother so he could inherit 100% of his family's estate he had tried to get his sister to help him with the killing

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:33.120
and promised her an even split once the job was done however the Duke's sister didn't want to join in on the plan and so he killed her

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:39.720
first despite the Duke's capability for violence sad describes him as a coward who will only pick on people below him

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.959
physically financially and socially when challenged on an even playing field the

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:51.800
Duke always buckles the next character we are introduced to is the bishop the bishop is 5 years younger than the Duke

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:59.560
and is presented as an inferior version of him the bishop has a delicate Vis is shorter less intimidating and sickly the

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.959
only element in which he Rivals his older brother is his capacity for sexual violence the bishop made his money by

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:10.639
stealing The Inheritance he was entrusted to pass on to the two young children of a dying friend after the

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:17.279
brothers we are then introduced to the judge age 59 the judge is described as a lanky man with sharp features sar's most

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:23.120
notable character trait for the judge is his disliking of hygienic practices therefore the judge produces a great

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:28.199
smell from his ass an area of his body he prefers uncleaned I'll go no further

00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:33.600
as I'd like to keep some ads on this video the judge's backstory includes the violating and killing of a young girl

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.800
and mother the father/ husband of which he had recently sentenced the death by guillotine whilst the death sentence was

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:47.240
playing out the judge forced the two women to watch and lastly we have the banker aged 53 the banker is a small and

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:53.160
fat man who regularly sleeps with the Duke from the outset he possesses an upbeat and chirpy demeanor but like the

00:15:53.160 --> 00:16:00.240
others har is a much more Sinister side like the Duke the banker murdered his family to obtain his inheritance

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.319
following these descriptions the four prostitutes who were going to join in on the 120 days are described after the

00:16:06.319 --> 00:16:12.600
introduction we are given the meat and potatoes of the story broken up into four parts the 120 days takes place from

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:19.560
November to February the plan for sad was to detail every day throughout the 4 months however due to unknown reasons

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:26.720
likely a lack of space on the scroll sad only managed to fully flesh out part one which is titled simple passions sad

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.240
presents this section as a journal and he describes the day-by-day debauchery with a matter of fact attachment that

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:38.360
adds to the horror of the content being described despite the undeniable degeneracy of what is being relayed the

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:44.160
first part is the tamest as the brutality of the sexual violence only increases throughout the months in part

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:50.160
one the four Libertines and their victims sit in four separate alcoves and are told a tale by The Prostitute Madame

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.959
duclo over the 30 days the story slowly evolves and the sexual slvi olent acts

00:16:55.959 --> 00:17:02.199
inflicted on the victims become more extreme following du close's story The Libertines engage in a huge supper

00:17:02.199 --> 00:17:08.558
followed by an orgy this routine more or less repeats throughout this part at the end of part one Duo finishes her tale

00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:15.160
and is celebrated by all four Libertines for doing her job well she is invited to the last day of November's supper a very

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:21.720
prestigious offer The Libertines then make a promise to do clothes that she would not have to suffer the same amount of Cruelty as the others she has

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:28.960
promised immunity and is told she will safely be returned to Paris once the 120 days is completed following this The

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:35.080
Libertines have their last supper of November in which du close and the two Libertines the judge and the Duke get so

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:41.760
drunk that they pass on the evening's orgy the other two the banker and the bishop do not pass it up and continue to

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:48.440
business as usual the only fully written out section of the 120 days ends as such

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:54.960
everyone repaired to his bed at 2: in the morning and was thus the month of November ended thus came to a close the

00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.799
first phase of this lubricious and interesting holiday for whose second part we will not keep the public waiting

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:06.880
if to our consideration it has kindly received what we have chronicled so far what is interesting about reading the

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:13.360
120 days of Sodom despite the general Intrigue regarding the content is the notes that are included in the printed

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.520
text it is important to remember that 120 days is a first draft and so it

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:24.600
contains a lot of continuity errors and notes for things to improve upon sad actually leaves a space after the first

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:30.400
part titled mistakes I have made in this section sad notes things that how he didn't like the way he allowed one of

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.799
the prostitutes to convey an emotional response when a tale was being told another note reminds him to not reveal

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:42.360
so many violent acts so as to keep the crescendo of debauchery at a steady Pace throughout the story lastly he notes

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:48.640
inconsistencies with characters for example in one of the scenes he calls a character a virgin who previously in

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:54.440
another scene had been in sads words depilated in every

00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:01.480
sector when later I put the text in final order I must must be particularly careful to have a notebook beside me at

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:08.400
all times I'll have to put down very exact mention of each happening and each portrate as I write it otherwise I'll

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:14.520
get horribly confused because of the multitude of characters the last three parts the

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:20.600
complex passions the criminal passions and the murderous passions are written as a list of increasingly vile actions

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:26.080
against the victims that include sodomy scat rape and eventually death for some

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:31.799
reason sad never got around to fully flashing out the last three and it's likely for the best therefore reading

00:19:31.799 --> 00:19:37.480
these sections is simply just reading an ever increasing list of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up actions against helpless victims to give

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:43.840
you an idea of what this is like dear viewer I'm going to read you an excerpt from part four the murderous passions to

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:50.840
help you understand why the 120 days of Sodom is the rightful owner of the claim to be the most impure tale ever written

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:56.280
I must warn you that the quote is graphic so feel free to skip ahead about 30 seconds if you're not in the mood or

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:02.320
eating or have a conscience however if you are none of them then stick around and here goes the inevitable

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:08.520
demonetization of this video the 14th 73 a man whose simple

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:15.120
taste was to flog a girl perfects it by everyday removing morels of Flesh the size of a pee from the girl's body but

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.400
her wounds are not dressed and thus she perishes over a low fire as it were dis

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:26.320

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:34.840
comprises the main element more strongly than ever urge her to furnish abundant details 74 he who was fond of letting

holds the child by the head over a large charal brazer which burns her very slowly the victims must be

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:33.760
virgins despite believing he would spend the rest of his life in a mental institution

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.840
in sharington sad was released a year after his arrival in 1790 due to the

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:45.559
abolishment of the letters de cashet he was 50 years old sad was once again a free man but unfortunately his freedom

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:51.279
inspired something in his wife as she left him immediately upon his being released sad thus struck up a new

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:58.000
relationship with Marie constant quet an actress in her 30s who remained by sad side for the rest of his life between 7

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.400
1991 and 1793 s began publishing political works he became involved in a

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:09.679
revolutionary party of which he soon became a prominent member as he ascended to the position of president for a short

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:15.640
time in 1793 sad had also continued his erotic writing and wanted to publish some of the works that he had been

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:22.000
sending in pieces to his wife whilst at the Bas Still Of The Works published there were Justine published in 1791 and

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.039
Juliet published in 1797 zad also published short stories and poems that he had hoped would bring in financial

00:22:28.039 --> 00:22:33.480
security as by now he was deeply in debt they did not the works published during

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:39.200
this time were very controversial though leading to s's Publishers office being raided by French authorities and many

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:46.159
manuscripts were destroyed sad was then arrested on orders from Napoleon sad was kept at St Peli until 1803 when he was

00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:51.440
relocated to bit he was moved due to him sleeping with caretakers once again sad

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:57.320
would cause issues in the institution by riling up fellow prisoners he would once again start writing feverishly to kill

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:04.880
time the last piece of writing published while sad was alive was in 1813 called lakis the gr the following year sad felt

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:14.480
ill with a fever and due to a number of complications he died on the 2nd of December 1814 he was 74 years

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:26.919
old as I mentioned before sad had died with the belief that his greatest work his Masterpiece the 120 days of Sodom

00:23:26.919 --> 00:23:33.440
had perished in the flame that engulfed the bastil in early July of 1789 unbeknownst toad when his wife had

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:38.559
returned to the basle to find it reduced to Rubble the scroll had not gone down with a prism but instead had already

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:45.400
been taken by a young man called AR no D St maximin days before the Basil's collapse the motivations behind his

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:51.159
taking of the scroll or how he knew of the scroll's existence will remain unknown forever however the important

00:23:51.159 --> 00:23:57.559
thing is the scroll was saved and St maximin wasted no time in selling it to an aristocrat by the name of the mares

00:23:57.559 --> 00:24:02.880
de nerve trans whose family held on to the scroll for over 100 years within the

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.760
100 Years of the scroll having been kept sard's other writing slowly began to pick up a small fan base the scroll

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:14.240
during the 1800s was still unknown however other published works of sad caught the attention of a German

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:20.159
psychiatrist by the name of Richard Von craft ebbing craft ebbing would be best known for his book on sexual pathologies

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:25.760
called psychopathia sexualis published in 1886 in the book craft debing makes

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:33.679
mention of sad whom he was fascinated by and even defines the term attributed to sad own name and nature

00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:39.279
sadism sadism is experience of sexual pleasurable Sensations including orgasm

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:45.640
produced by acts of Cruelty bodily punishment inflicted on one's own person or when witnessed in others be they

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:52.679
animals or human beings it may also consist of an innate desire to humiliate hurt wound or even destroy others in

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:57.880
order thereby to create sexual pleasure in oneself psychopathia sexualis was was

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:03.760
undoubtedly a large influence on the understanding of what at the time were unusual sexual pathologies often kept

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:10.600
under WS it is likely that it was this book that introduced s to a German dermatologist and sexologist called Ian

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:16.200
block block was a researcher on sexual disease during the time and was well tuned into to the vibrant homosexual

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:22.679
nightlife blossoming in the late 1800s in Germany due to his profession blotch was exposed to the devastating effects

00:25:22.679 --> 00:25:29.360
of sexual diseases on a regular basis and attributed their spread to a decline in humanity he was also a non-believer

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:35.399
in the idea of people having innate sexual desires and believed homosexuals to be how they are due to exterior

00:25:35.399 --> 00:25:41.919
influences like substance abuse performing arts or masturbation it was when blch discovered sad that he began

00:25:41.919 --> 00:25:48.880
to rewire his way of thinking asad's outwardly homosexual writings along with a series of other turning points in bl's

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:54.960
life led him to conclude that homosexuality was indeed not influenced by negative exterior elements his change

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.840
in his thinking had begun with numerous of sad works but it was completely 18d when he got hold of the scroll in the

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:07.240
year 1900 the exact details of how blch acquired the scroll are unknown however according to Joel Warner's book The

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:14.480
Curse of the Maris dard block was likely told of the scroll's existence by neurotica collector ponus fraxy block

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:20.279
had been corresponding with fraxy for years and had done so right up until Fry's death in the year 1900 It is

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:26.039
believed that fraxy was aware of the scroll and inspired blotch to search for it thus blotch set about tracking down

00:26:26.039 --> 00:26:33.279
the scroll which likely according to Warner would have been brought from either a family member or family representative of the Maris the villain

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:39.120
nerve trans thus blotch would go on to publish the 120 days of Sodom in 1904 it

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.720
had remained unpublished for 119 years blch would hold on to the scroll until

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:51.559
he died on the 19th of November 1922 at the age of 50 the scroll was then given to Max harwitz the man who published all

00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:57.120
of Block's work on sad on the 29th of January 1929 a man called Maurice Hine

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:04.279
purchased the scroll from Hartz for 10,000 rice marks H purchased the scroll on behalf of the NOA family who had a

00:27:04.279 --> 00:27:11.360
family member directly related to sad that member was Marie LA henriet and in Haw who was sard's great great great

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:18.000
granddaughter once acquired the scroll had a profound effect on Marie who when asked what age did you become yourself

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.559
answered back 1929 the year she bought the scroll the NAA family would often hold sori parties

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:31.360
in their Paris Mansion during these parties Marie would show the scroll to many prominent people and read passages

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:37.039
aloud due to hine's work tracking down and obtaining the scroll Marie allowed him to view the scroll whenever he

00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:42.960
pleased which led to him republishing the 120 days of Sodom between 1931 to

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:48.000
1935 the tale was published as a three volume critical Edition the scroll would

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.720
remain in the hands of the naai family for decades when Marie died on January 29th 1970 the scroll was passed on to

00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:01.440
her daughter Natalie no like her mother Natalie would get the scroll out at parties and read passages aloud the

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:07.360
scroll would continue being paraded around the NOA family home until November 1982 when Natalie called up her

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:15.080
son Carlo Peron in a frenzy and told him that the scroll was missing a few months prior in September 1982 Natalie had

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:21.480
allowed French publisher Jean groet to borrow the scroll when groet returned the item to Natalie he had returned the

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:27.000
copper casing but had taken the manuscript out upon noticing its Disappearance in November Natalie called

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.640
the author ities and they immediately raided gret's house gret admitted that he had taken the scroll but that it was

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:39.320
now in Switzerland in the hands of a Swiss millionaire erotica collector called Gerard Nordman when Natalie's son

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:45.880
Peron traveled to Switzerland to explain the situation of the scroll being stolen and sold in bad faith Norman refused to

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:51.080
return the scroll Norman told Peron that it was his dream to have the manuscript and that he intended to hold on to it

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:57.760
until the day he died the NOA family filed a criminal complaint against gretes who was found guilty in 1990 he

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:04.320
received a 2-year suspended sentence as well as a 300,000 Frank fine unfortunately for the NOA family despite

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:10.519
finding gret guilty the scroll cannot be returned due to Switzerland not signing the 1970 convention on the means of

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:17.480
prohibiting and preventing the illicit import export and transfer of ownership of cultural property the 1970 convention

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:23.320
by the United Nations educational scientific and cultural organization was made to have stolen items returned to

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:29.440
the countries of those who had signed it thus for Norman to keep the scroll all we had to do was prove in a Swiss court

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.519
that he had bought it in good faith and on May 28th 1998 the Court ruled in

00:29:34.519 --> 00:29:41.919
Norman's favor however Norman would never be around to see this Victory as he passed away on February 5th 1992 the

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:48.799
scroll would thus remain in a possession of Norman's family until 2004 when the scroll was put on public display at an

00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:54.159
erotica exhibit at the biblioteca bod Mariana located in Switzerland the

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:59.720
scroll would not last long at the bibliotek of bod Mariana as as it was only a temporary donation from nbn's

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:06.320
family in 2017 right before the scroll was to be put up for auction France declared the 120 days of Sodom

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:12.440
manuscript to be a National Treasure due to this the scroll was not allowed to be put up for auction and negotiations

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:19.240
began for France to obtain it the scroll would remain in limbo until July 9th 2021 when the French government declared

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:25.240
it had acquired the manuscript it had cost $4,550 th000 and all of the money had

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:32.039
been donated by wealthy Investment Bank called Emanuel bad today the scroll still belongs to France and you can

00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:38.640
check out images of it online you can see the tiny handwriting that sad had feverishly penned under Candlelight for

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.880
those 37 days of creativity you can see the perfectly aligned words the Mastery

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:49.279
of the glued pieces of paper and the effort that went into the work that he believed have forever perished in the

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:54.640
Flames that engulfed the Bas little did he know the scroll had lived an impure

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.240
life of its own
