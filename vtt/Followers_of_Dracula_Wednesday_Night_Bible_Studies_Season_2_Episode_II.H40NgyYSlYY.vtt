ran off without me thank you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.980
hey thanks for coming back to Lady Babylon we have our Wednesday night bible study and tonight's topic will be

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.980
a little bit dark and spooky we're going to look at some coded language within

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.340
myth that is used in cult Cults with vampires

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.000
[Music]

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.900
foreign in order to warm up tonight I thought I

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.720
would introduce a new segment it's called testimonials and I am so

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.960
humbled at the responses that people have had to the material that I thought

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.600
it would be important for you to hear their voices or to hear your voices I'm

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.340
going to ask these people all the same questions and if I didn't get you in tonight don't worry it's because the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.479
question wasn't yours but the question that we have tonight is how has reason

00:01:47.479 --> 00:02:01.159
freed you from a cold [Music]

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.500
but reason got me out of the of the web

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.300
of the churchianity that had been strung around it so I reasoned out of that

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.060
um I just saw saw the flaws in it and understood that

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.940
um ah [Music] worship of the Bible which is what

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.300
Christianity is it's the false god all right because they they want every

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.640
word to be true they want somehow gold is exonerated because the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.280
Bible is true and when you realize all the holes in that that is reasonable and that got rid of got rid of that side

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.099
so I was left on my own to discover this and so my family encouraged me they're like well we ain't going to tell you

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.200
what to do but try to go to a church and so I went to some several churches

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.840
and I had a bad experience at a Catholic Church I remember where they wanted to baptize me it took me in a bathroom a

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.480
back room and I ran out I remember being like 12 years old

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.920
and it was some years later that you know once the family situation got

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:22.620
cleaned up and all the bad kids the older siblings were in jail and have you my father converted to Jehovah Witness

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.700
and they would come over to the house and you know I had long hair then because I was rock and roll and they

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.700
used to tell me you got to cut your hair you got to shave your head you got to cut your hair and I showed them the the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.739
magazine the Watchtower track Society you know they would have these little magazines they'd bring the Jehovah

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.860
Witness and I said well Jesus had long hair and I showed him the picture and I go why can't I be like that and they said

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.819
well that was different and that's what set me off on my study of what is Christianity who is Jesus in

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.180
in where do these books come from so yeah basically what happened with me is um as a young person in high school I

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.959
got involved with uh Evangelical Christianity through youth groups and through friends and I became very

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.540
heavily involved into that uh religion and way of thinking and it became quite

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.660
abusive and even after I left because of um abuse that was happening I was still

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.800
in that kind of mindset for a long time and it wasn't until I got into Academia and I went to the roots of these texts

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.199
like in the Bible and I realized what these people were telling me was wrong and that they were lying and I started

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:39.240
to embrace this reason approach and I started to think about and face reality as it is and I realized that for me uh

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.180
the reason why I fell into this trap of abusive religion is because I was looking for some kind of magical answer

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.600
you know I was denying the reality that was staring me in the face so I I think

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.259
it's a huge important thing that we we Embrace reason and we think about and approach the world from from that

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:05.460
perspective like we're looking at things as they really truly are because if you don't you open yourself up to be lied to

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.340
and exploited you know thank you so much everybody who

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.680
participated in that round of questions we'll have more to come in the future

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.780
tonight I want to start by turning to

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.440

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.160

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.759
and at a period of time in history when Vlad the Impaler was doing his thing

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:49.380

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:08.580
up translators personal translator because they try they try to do their job but this time I'm going to bring up

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:15.299
the most excellent translator of the orphic hymns who is athanasakius and he

00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:23.940
does a fantastic job typically except here in this last line is

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:35.940
oh the translation here he translated the somaton's Dual bodied or double

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:44.700
fleshed which would be great if it was dies plus omatone but we know the root Soma is in

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:50.100
there so the prefix really here is D not D's d

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:55.980
means twice but d as lactances tells us

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.860
is the beginning of the word

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:10.860
who is this she is the one who brings the bullet the

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:19.440
council the rule of the sea or as we're told d

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:26.520

wow wow um

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:48.360
remember I warned you about getting taken out back a lot of a lot of the stuff that they have in academics is

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:55.919
meant to kind of you know come here come here little person and um one of those big things that's

00:19:55.919 --> 00:20:01.320
used is a lure big candy for the kitties is the Indo-European and the

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.380
Indo-European the proto-indo-european that do not exist

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:12.840
tend to obscure our understanding of the Linguistics of antiquity what do we know

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:19.559
from the Greeks that they're this group there's this group this ethnic group The pulaskians and there's some of the old

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:25.679
old generation that comes that are that is is part of these Bronze Age

00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:31.860
migrations so um we get their groups scattered in

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:39.419
different places with different people claiming to be the ancestors of that original group of pulaskians and

00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:45.780
um you can you can put your connection to the Etruscans right there so um what

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:50.880
is happening in the language what is happening in the language the um bring

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:57.720
us up that last hymn line again dude thank you Chewie yeah um how is this

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:03.120
translated yeah it well it's translated terribly here I'll just read to you I'm

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.820
sorry Dr athanasakis but you know you can take it you can take it

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.919
um yeah here's his translation whose skin when she was pregnant he mangled in

00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:19.919
Anger yeah he's trying to form this but wait he's trying to I'm sorry but he's

00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:25.440
trying to form this to his preconceived notion of the myth you know this is done

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:31.620
all the time don't worry about it it's translators have to try to make sense of things but if this is desomatone from

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:38.580
the Etruscan side and it's leaking in here then what which makes sense in the right right it's right for the quora

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:45.780
then um what is um that really is the word for drawing

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:51.140
yes yes for drawing or sucking drawing out

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:57.080
drying out what what's happening someone is drawing out the

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:02.120
God bodied sus uh

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:07.679
sustained flesh the god-sustained flesh

00:22:07.679 --> 00:22:13.799
and it's whose flesh it's the chorus flesh and where is this flesh going it's

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:20.220
going sumoy it's going into the into the breath

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:27.780
into the understanding yeah yeah so here we have a reference to some

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:34.799
kind of consumption of something some kind of well here's the fun thing about Classics if we know that we're in the

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:39.960
context of him and we know that this hymn is being sung during performance

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:46.080
during cult performance and we know these Mysteries and we can get just a

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:51.500
little tiny look inside the Mysteries you thought you guys were getting the Mysteries right weren't you for 55

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:56.760
95 that's not how it works or if you go into Harvard Japan you guys are paying

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.799
60 000 a year right anyway

00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:09.480
um you can't sell it so let's look inside let's look inside just for a moment inside this and this

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.780
hymn that we've got that's opening up for us what is the background of what's being performed in the song what's

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:23.880
happening um and when we get there we find that somebody is consuming the flesh

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:30.659
of the god okay everybody cool everybody cool with that all you

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:35.820
Bargains all you mean AD women who got together you have this thing where you

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:42.900
Sin from the mountains and you take out human beings you maraud through Villages

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:49.140
and you tear apart men who shouldn't be messing with you and you consume the

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:55.140
flesh you you um you go into the homophagy yeah those

00:23:55.140 --> 00:24:00.840
you guys won't be offended by any of this but let's look at the let's look at the language and we'll give you a chance

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:07.500
to look right into the religion now so what is what happens he's um we're drawing the Flesh of this we're socking

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:16.440
the Flesh of this where else do we see this draw we see this drawing askless go to the last text here

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:22.320
um not that one yep oops here we go without this here is

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:28.520
the translation by Smythe I just want you to see it's uh an engagement in the

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:34.559
libation bearers um to the cooperoi two between orestes

00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:41.880
and the chorus and you can see the top he says and where does the tail end and what is its consummation and the chorus

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.340
says she laid it to rest as if it were a child in swaddling clothes oh I forget

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:52.919
to tell you this is Clyde of nestro and she dreams she gave birth to a serpent

00:24:52.919 --> 00:24:58.679
okay she dreamed she gave birth to a serpent and what does she do she put it

00:24:58.679 --> 00:25:04.980
in swaddling clothes yeah um what uh what food did it crave the

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:10.500
newborn Viper and of course is in her dreams she offered it her own breast and

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:15.900
the rest he says surely her nipple was not wounded by the lust and Beast and

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:21.440
the chorus says the line relevant to us in our hymn no it drew the clotted blood

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:27.600
with the milk it drew the clotted blood with the milk

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:35.000
and this is the last line at the bottom yeah and it says

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:43.740
fasai she's drawing up she's sucking that excuse me that serpent is sucking up

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:49.520
this clotted blood

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.620
congealed with in the milk

00:25:55.919 --> 00:26:00.960
that's fine you can take it off in the milk yes

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:07.440
um drying up this clotted blood in the milk in this act yeah

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:16.200
um gorgeous what is happening we know the Galena is drawn from the breast so there we have a uh there we have a

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:23.159
reference a balancing of our doubt and our antidote I'm right into him it's nice that it's

00:26:23.159 --> 00:26:29.760
right there snug and in the context of the drugs great now how do we take this

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:37.440
and apply it one step more outwards so that what's the utility of this so that we can see our own reality look here at

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:45.120
the top it says Adam said this is now bone of my bones and sarks of my sarks

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:51.179
flashing My Flesh right she will be called gunay

00:26:51.179 --> 00:26:57.600
she will be called gunay because from the man

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.700
she was taken yeah yeah

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:08.760
from the man she was taken from elephant is the Greek here and people will say

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:15.419
wait a minute wait a minute I thought the the Old Testament was written in Hebrew right you've been paying those

00:27:15.419 --> 00:27:20.640
guys in Harvard too much um you you saw it was written in Hebrew

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:27.059
right okay well let's see if it was because in the Greek the idiom doesn't

00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:34.320
work she'll be called gunay because she was taken from the man but

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:40.020
the man's name doesn't have anything to do with gunay so why is it saying she'll

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:47.340
be um she'd be called this because she was taken from man

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:52.980
how linguistically doesn't work out right okay must not be written in Greek

00:27:52.980 --> 00:28:00.000
must a Greek must be a translation that's what we've all thought for so long the problem is the Hebrew is ishin

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.240
Isha the ah on the Isha it's just a feminization it has nothing to do with

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:13.559
the verb for pulling out of or coming from so once again it doesn't make sense

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:20.820
the only language that makes sense is the Latin that uses the

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:27.539
etruscu old words we find old words in Latin that from a trust from etruscum like

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:33.000
parkolum that special cup that you drain the drink the ceremonial potion is

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.140
that's a Pokemon yeah and um here we have one as well we

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:46.460
have a word that's coming through the Etruscan tradition here

00:28:46.679 --> 00:28:53.658
yeah and that is weirago and it means

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:59.179
from lead from man where is man and ago

00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:05.100
the ah Groot in Latin is the the word for leading or driving

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:11.220
so what's funny is this statement Shall be Called woman because she was taken

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:18.899
from man makes perfect sense if the word weirago is used but it makes no sense

00:29:18.899 --> 00:29:26.039
either way in Native Greek or in Hebrew now there's

00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:31.200
no way this Etruscan tradition is coming through the Hebrew the words are

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.440
different but the words overlap The Roots overlap in Greek

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:43.740
so what is likely to be happening your Septuagint your Greek Old Testament is

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:49.679
the original and it is conveying as Greek does aptly

00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:55.260
Etruscan ideas okay that's as close as we can get to

00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:01.740
that original source now you were told that this doesn't this isn't how the world is put together and you will have

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:09.059
somebody come to you a submitic study scholar and they will throw the 10th Century at you

00:30:09.059 --> 00:30:14.700
yes and you can tell them you can tell them that you're looking for that

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:23.700
original that original is the secret of the vampires yes it's the secret of those who sunk

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:30.480
the Hyma yeah it's the secret that is both Medical

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:38.700
and individual and personal their secret is a woman

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:46.880
yeah and that makes me want to make statues dance

00:30:48.500 --> 00:31:04.880
[Music]

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:10.799
thank you for coming tonight now that we know the secret

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:17.159
of the vampires is a woman

00:31:17.159 --> 00:31:24.840
um let's um next time we meet we're going to traipse through in the Bible study we're going to traips through the Renaissance

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:30.779
and we're going to follow those who also followed her

00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:35.820
isn't this nice I want you to see the saturnian rights

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:43.140
through time I want you to see the dragons who protected those rights

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:48.440
I want you to see the order that was established

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.539
and what exactly the vampires

00:31:53.539 --> 00:32:01.860
moved into what they became and what they did and how your history is not a

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:06.960
history of of bran writing about a guy

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:13.980
