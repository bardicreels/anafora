01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:17.000
the scholarship behind this is getting some attention finally and what we need

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.839
people keep asking what you know documentary wise people are talking to me about documentaries now um what do we

01:01:23.839 --> 01:01:31.400
need to do what you know know what kind of um how do we cover this material um

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:37.720
are there people that can verify yes the expertise is in the classical studies

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:45.520
it's in the language it's embedded in there and if we can bring that out if we can bring those experts forward come on

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:52.599
and and have them look at these texts they can verify everything that I'm saying it's very important for me that

01:01:52.599 --> 01:01:58.480
you know that this these are just Tex that are facts of history there just

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:06.240
facts of History they're evidence these texts are evidence they are embedded in time and all we have to do you know we

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:13.240
don't have to look at them and believe them we don't have to make a cult we don't have to create some kind of Faith

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:18.720
No that's not what we're here for we're here to take those texts and say what do

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:25.359
they tell us about those people what do they tell us about our ancestors what do

01:02:25.359 --> 01:02:30.640
they tell us about earlier civilizations and what happened to them most

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:35.880
importantly what do they tell us about civilizations that created the worship

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:44.039
of a muse and things like democracy sprang from it that's most important that well

01:02:44.039 --> 01:02:49.119
