Greek and in seminary they'll tell you and the word for

00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:55.079
Jesus coming to be among men is the word to set up a

00:16:55.079 --> 00:17:02.120
tent and it is a reflection of the dent in the wilderness right they really get

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:07.400

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:31.080
and the logos was with God and the Loos was the God and you know this one was in

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:37.679

anybody tell me what that logos is what is that Alice give me that how's that way you phrased it the inward debate of

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:57.000
the soul the inward debate of the soul the accounting the

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:03.880
Reckoning the reason the

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:11.520
logos so John says in the beginning was the logos and nus says I'll let me

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:20.480
translate that for you next one yep thank you perfect here's his

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:29.559
translation yeah there is a logos and that logos is AC chronic and

00:20:29.559 --> 00:20:35.919
unaccessible and it dwells within the inexpressible

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:41.760
AR it dwells within the beginning it dwells within the

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:48.720
Reich it dwells within the rulership where those archons

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:54.840
are yeah yeah and this place is

00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:01.520
Aron it cannot be expressed it is

00:21:01.799 --> 00:21:11.840
ineffable and what is this logos this logos is just like its Sam natured

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:18.960
parent the son Amor the son without a

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:30.039
