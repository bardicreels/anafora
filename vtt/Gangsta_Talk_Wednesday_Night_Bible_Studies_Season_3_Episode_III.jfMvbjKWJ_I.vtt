your eyes it opens your eyes it'll send you into the edamame it's

00:08:58.019 --> 00:09:05.040
powerful stuff and it's got aphrodisiacs in it and that's why we have little children

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.080
all over the New Testament little children getting touched

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.680
little children getting scandalized little children ended up in towns this

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.560
guy has so many naked children around them have you ever wondered who showed

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:30.080
up who showed up at his tomb I shot up with his Tim yeah women

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.880
women who they called prostitutes yeah

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:42.660
women he was constantly trying to keep him safe and they knew Jesus was associated with the prostitutes he's got

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:48.060
something going on if we're in an investigation about why that naked boy

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:53.820
was with him in a public park we gotta know that he's performing pimp-like protections

00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:01.440
for these women they show up it is it is death they show up and there's a kid

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.899
there inside is Tim before this group can even get to him we know the Bible

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:13.380
tells us they he's not associate of prostitutes and accountants right so he's got something going on

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:18.839
Peter's not the only one who's knocking off people for cash right

00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:26.040
right he's not the only one he knows how this act Works he's not the only one who's immune to the Venoms

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.680
right these guys have the Venoms on board this is some major major stuff and

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.779
this Samaritan woman who steps up and steps into the breach

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:43.500
she stands against his racism because you know what you know why the Jews and the Samaritans fight

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:49.740
because the Samaritans worship a woman isn't that some they worship a woman

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:56.700
nobody saw that was a smart woman we have christianized her we've taken that Samaritan womb we have

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:03.839
christianized her you'll hear people preaching from the pulpit you will hear feminists talk about her and that we

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:09.660
have completely certified Her Image completely

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:18.320
this is a woman who worships a woman you're not going to tell me to get you water you got water alive yeah show me

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:24.720
show me I you think you're the Christos is that what you think and there's

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.480
something lovely that happens in the middle of this conversation right she says she says to him in the

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.579
Greek right you thank you that one let me see us

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:41.360
right the one they call Christos

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.420
right that was the name the Messiah wasn't the name for the dude within the

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:55.680
right the Christ was the name for the dude and the Samaritan points it out why because she worships the lady who's the

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:05.700
head of everything who brings you that burning purple right she brings you that ionic life you

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:12.360

yeah but it's not something that justifies an invasion but um but they just use I would say in

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:24.420
Russia LGBT as a boogeyman basically so for them it's a an example of like a

Kumai why because that's where we go into the underworld right this is the Quantum part

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.620
we have to open up that underworld you didn't think Jesus was arrested in

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:33.900
public park with a naked boy you didn't think the woman at the well was a hero

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:39.179

going to find that place what does she say what is what does Medea say give sting to my poisons ah they were named

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.960
loss give that power to move

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:05.340

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:11.100
Fire seeds of fire are in your poison

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.419
what does she start to do

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:23.880
she starts to cut herself she starts to cut herself and remember

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.980
these Medusa they carry the poison in their hair they

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:34.919
have it constantly there the Aero poison in this passage Nero points out it's all

00:28:34.919 --> 00:28:43.080
about the bow it says Medea the bow it's all grounded in that poison

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:50.100
in that communion and Medea even says after she's around the time that she's

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:57.860
identified as lucifera she talks about her sacred latte Kiss

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:05.039
Her Sacred lanti case what is latex or latex what is that it's

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:10.380
the milky white juice that comes off the Opium poppy

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:16.380
when you cut it now it doesn't have to be just opium

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:22.740
can be any juice any juice excretion

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:28.020
that transfers from the source

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:33.480
to the participant the ionic life

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:41.159
yeah that eye-opening Medea says her blood is that life

00:29:41.159 --> 00:29:46.440
is that life she is the Christ

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:54.480
she is the savior more than a thousand years before Jesus ever existed

00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:02.820
Jesus Gangsta G knows what he's doing he's been educated in Egypt right he comes

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:09.419
back after they told him the magic I told him they were like this dude's gonna be the king of everything right

00:30:09.419 --> 00:30:14.760
right he goes down to Egypt he gets his education he's got his drugs with him

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:21.440
he's got a ton of frankincense and myrrh he's got the very elements that you mix everything else in

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:28.340
Jesus was using drugs so heavily that his

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:33.539
operation of the mystery was a constant unceasing

00:30:33.539 --> 00:30:38.580
we're going to look over the next couple of weeks what happens when you're under

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:44.340
the influence of this communion we're going to talk about that thirst

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:51.600
we're going to look into the cult and we're going to see Jesus who by the way got popped in the end he got popped

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:59.000
someone turned on him he got handed over for justice somebody was having a debate with Neil about

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.220
Jesus getting handed over Paul says he got handed over pot of did

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:12.799
though me you know that's used for giving somebody to the authorities so that they can find Justice

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:19.500
bring to Justice Jesus got brought to Justice he got brought to Justice in the

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:26.100
in the end he's yelling remember the same guy the same cocky gangster who's

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:34.320
standing there who's standing there with this woman of Samaria who is the gall to

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:42.600
stand in his face when he's a man right says you know who I am that same guy who

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:51.360
said I've got the juice that you will never thirst again that same guy is screaming out from a

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.520
cross I'm so thirsty ah

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:04.140
and he's screaming magical phrases yeah Suboxone

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:12.840
the Samaritans that are looking for the Christos which the Jews call Messias

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:18.899
you see how it works you've been looking in the wrong you thought you were looking in the entrance you're looking in the exit

00:32:18.899 --> 00:32:24.240
right we got to get back there we gotta get back to those times so over the next

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:30.779
that's our 30 minutes that's all the devil gives me but over the next

00:32:30.779 --> 00:32:37.620
couple of Bible studies I want to go to these places so that you can see the

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:45.419
cult and operation you can see this person who enters that

00:32:45.419 --> 00:32:55.100
phase who enters the edemon who enters that place where the heavens are opened

00:32:55.100 --> 00:33:00.840
is able to transmit and I want you to see what that brings I want you to see

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:05.880
it I want you to realize those seven stars that Jesus holds in his hand

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:12.000
the Seven Stars are the same Seven Stars that Medea uses

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:21.980
to form the cup the cup of the Sacred communion yeah Jesus Christ was high

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:29.659
high on Venoms high on venoms yeah somebody just wrote to me and said

00:33:29.659 --> 00:33:35.880
I get this a lot where people say have you said that and I didn't believe you

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:42.539
but now I saw something and now you were right and I'm amazed that you're right

00:33:42.539 --> 00:33:47.760
as if I'm some sort of you know constant plotter

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:53.760
of dark deception right no so uh scorpion turns out

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:59.279
scorpion venom is the most expensive Solution on the planet

00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:06.419
right it turns out pound for pound it's the most expensive and why is that

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:12.358
well I don't know but I can tell you in Antiquity they were using it they were using it

00:34:12.359 --> 00:34:18.658
yeah using it in these weird weird stuff they were doing but it was medical too

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:25.200
yeah they weren't just smoking these things like they did in Pakistan right they were in Antiquity they were

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:32.839
integrating it with the medicine yeah you got to get that body remember the polypharmacy to the shout out to the

00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:41.940
uh gentleman uh pharmacologist neuropharmacologists who contacted me

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:48.000
um shout out to you yeah and because you know the art you know what's going on

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.580
yeah imagine that the next level of pharmacology right making the patient

00:34:55.580 --> 00:35:00.660
the manufacturer of the drug you can give

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:08.760
people things to make them produce the drug that you need to to reach that

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:15.599
ionic yeah persistence they say it makes you live a long time they said she looked

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:20.700
like she was 12 years old and it didn't make sense media right why does she look like she's 12 years old and she leads

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:26.160
the Army why is she the only one who can stand up against the other guys who have

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:32.820
the bow poisons why is she the only one that can stand up against them why is she the master of the purple

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:38.900
all right it's because she's producing it she is producing the communion her
