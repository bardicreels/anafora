about halfway he said forgive them Father they know not what they do

yeah fantastic let's jump in let's jump in tonight tonight I want to take you to

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:48.479
an article people have been discussing cannabis and its use in Antiquity and

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:55.500
you and I have seen for those who weren't here for the first season you and I have seen that cannabis was

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:03.180
represented by the street name a Starion the star right the star isn't that

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.539
beautiful and so we're going to look at cannabis because there is an accusation

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.620
flying around it somebody is getting stoned and that these people were

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.539
getting stoned they're very famous people like good old Moses in his tent

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:25.919
smoke and the thing and we're told that

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.199
something's going on let's see okay right what do we do though on our way

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:37.979

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:17.160
BC there are no books from 1450 BC

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.560

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:30.840
a major Source can give you facts that aren't real how is this possible pull the uh

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:37.080

to the Sinners I loved it there's an essence of wafting in the air

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:28.139
it's lovely okay let's get back to that quote um that second yeah marijuana

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:35.039
proponent suggests the recipe I should be tall on this one for the anointing oil pass from God to Moses including

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:40.979
cannabis or Connor blossom in Hebrew okay

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:46.260
this should be easy everybody here knows where I'm going let's look at the Greek

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:51.839
text that first appears historically I said look at the Greek text of the

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:58.019
Septuagint this is easy right you want to find Cannabis you want to find

00:08:58.019 --> 00:09:06.360
Cannabis let's go check let's go check if it's there before you monkeys start

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:13.560
jumping up and down for bananas okay just wait just wait

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:20.540
next one here it is here are the verses that they quoted

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:31.680
and take that hey Deuce Mata what is that jedus Mata those are those elements

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:38.360
of pharmacology and Antiquity that have to do with the spicy

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.740
incense that we're creating to have fumigations

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:49.560
fumigations that's a technical word on the pharmacological side hedusma

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.860
right those are those aromatics

00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:01.200
aromatics it's a technical term people right oh I love you I love it let's show

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:08.040
them get get it up there I've got the hey deucema after that they'll just go there yeah

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:14.420
spices aromatics and look at the sources that he gives at the bottom Hippocrates

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:21.600
diseases of women and diascortis one six one pull that down and I can tell you

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:28.980
for a fact in diascorities he has to consider this type of drug because it's

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:34.680
a very common not only medicine way of administering medicinals but a very

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.959
common cold use of drugs when you have the altar of incense the altar of

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:45.060
incense that's a part of your practice right how are you going to make the

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:50.399
stuff that you burn and inhale you can blow it up your nose too I can

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:55.860
take it from a priestess in my nose it was a little tiny Reed insufflation they

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.079
call it insufflation there's something about insufflation

00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:06.480
when you're being insufflated by a priestess on the island of Cyprus within

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:12.779
the Temple of Aphrodite you've made it you have made it

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:18.899
let's go to the next let's keep burning yeah oh just don't

00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:27.120
forget that um sale of funness fatal to all quadrupeds yeah yeah on the

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:33.720
application of the root to the genitals why did I throw that in there why did I

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:39.959
throw that in there because we are applying drugs we are applying drugs

00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:45.000
did you know the Bible was so sexy no you didn't go back to Moses go get get

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.800
us back to that text from the very Beginnings up uh yeah there we go yeah okay so what does he say that's jeduce

00:11:52.800 --> 00:12:01.740
Matas these aromatics right and now he's gonna listen for you what those are he gives you he gives you the recipe this

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:08.000
is the holy recipe it's the holy recipe here it comes to anthos

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.660
yeah well it's got myrrh in it we know that Smyrna at least right and give a

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:21.000
Smyrna it's the first Greek up there yeah look at this look at this sometimes

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.579
it's written nice nice but it's mura we know that see

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:32.220
is that Arabian tree right myrrh we've got no problem there but look it's used

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:38.160
in if you can go halfway down that paragraph and not usually the audience

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:44.160
if you look halfway down that paragraph down to the Greek wordness

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.639
[Music]

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:55.860
that's what that thing is yeah what is what are those

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:01.860
let's go back to the Greek those are fumigations bro there's fumigations

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:09.899
yeah yeah good that's okay go back to the text excellent so we've got some Smyrna there

00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:14.940
and what else do we have we it gives a weight of it who cares and then so much

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:20.040
Kina momon you can probably pick that one out that's just cinnamon bra it's

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:28.980
just cinnamon brown what do you do with your cinnamon you get the stuff that's you get the stuff that smells awesome

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:35.660
good smelling stuff you mean there's different times yeah you get the really really good stuff

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:42.540
that's the reserve the special go back to that text we're reading the Bible we're reading the Bible and what else is

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:49.079
in this substance by the way we're going to take this substance and we're going to cover everything with it we're going

00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:56.399
to cover boys with it we're going to cover candlesticks with it we're going to cover altars with it the whole place

00:13:56.399 --> 00:14:01.920
is gonna stink of this stuff so it's important to see what it is that

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.260
we're using in our drug and someone's alleging that we're using cannabis

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:13.620
let's keep reading the verse but so far I don't see it okay what else do we have here

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.920
we have oh half as much right and what

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:26.480
kalamu oh deuce calamus

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:35.160
fragrant calamus you know the kind that is not cannabis

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.519
okay now where's the mistake that's written there in English that we didn't

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:47.339
notice go back Chewie I know this is flips but go back to that first uh

00:14:47.339 --> 00:14:53.519
second slide that we had second slide yeah marijuana proponents suggested the

00:14:53.519 --> 00:15:02.579
recipe for the anointing oil pass from God to Moses include cannabis so far it's not in there or can a blossom in

00:15:02.579 --> 00:15:08.519
Hebrew they point to versions calling for fragrant cane

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:13.800
which they say was mistakenly changed to the plant calamus in the King James

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:19.740
version of the Bible it was mistakenly from the Hebrew the King James was

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:26.760
referring to this thing got turned around 180 degrees because the fairy tale that we are all not believing

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:32.279
anymore is that the Hebrew produced the Greek as

00:15:32.279 --> 00:15:37.760
a translation no no no we know the Greek is the original

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:45.120
so um notice did you catch there a mistake by King James King James

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:51.300
15 how many how many centuries later are you going to want to talk about from

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:57.300
Antiquity let's go back to Antiquity and look what the source says there is no

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:04.260
cannabis in the anointing oil that is used in Exodus it's not there

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:11.699
and you're gonna say no it's a misinterpretation it's misinterpretation of the Hebrew

00:16:11.699 --> 00:16:17.339
okay wait a minute stop yourselves right now right now just stop

00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:22.560
and ask yourself could the Greeks

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.740
have been misinterpreting the Hebrew

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:35.240
I forgot there are so many Hebrew medical authors

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:43.380
I forgot they write about no no wait what wait what no we don't have any Hebrew

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:50.579
medical authors oh well that's a difficulty if we're talking about drugs how about pharmacological work

00:16:50.579 --> 00:16:57.660
no we have no Hebrew pharmacological works either to consult

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:04.319
you mean this is the appearance of that word and you don't have a context outside of it wait let me get this

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:10.020
straight the Greeks at the time that this text that I'm reading to you

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:17.339
has been start mesmerizing them with pictures of of of symbols of religious symbols satanic

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:25.860
things go ahead the Greeks in the third Century second century first century are building

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:31.200
the museum all across the world their

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:37.799
world at least people are doing research and writing

00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:42.860
entire volumes on plants and on animals zoology

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.900
you've got philosophers out the backside

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:58.140
Madison herophilus incredible Physicians air assist routes

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:03.600
doing dissections pulling apart the human body to explain

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.640
the physiology you have alexandrian

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:15.419
priests who were talking about drugs and their antidotes and which drugs to give

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:20.640
for which reasons and you have no Hebrew you have no

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:28.320
Hebrew you have no Hebrew sources no you don't the medicine and the drugs just like the

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:36.419
language Greek is what the people are using and when this Greek says a very very specific

00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:41.700
plant for which the Greeks were highly highly trained

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:48.780
and diarrhea that the mouth on these different drugs you mean it's

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:56.640
their mistake in their magical translation where they stepped in with 72 of these guys all from the tribes of

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.860
Israel different chambers and pow

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:10.460
Beam Beam of information into the brain right out the Greek magic absolute magic

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.539

that Holy anointing that is not the anointing of

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:12.419
the oil that is used in the consecration of the king it's not the oil that's used

00:22:12.419 --> 00:22:17.640
in the gymnasium either it's the oil that gives you an erection

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:24.360
yeah it's the oil that gives you an erection love it that's the ristos and you say

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:48.600
this this is from euripides this is feedra talking right and what is

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:56.820
she saying she's asking a question to her nurse she's saying what time what type of drug is this a Christ or a

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:04.500
potable is this one of those drugs that you take and you rub into your skin

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:10.679
or is this one of those drugs that you take in the rectum is this one that a

00:23:10.679 --> 00:23:16.740
priestess is going to blow up my nose is this one that's gonna come out of

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:24.000
somebody's body and I'm gonna swallow in communion within the mystery what

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.299
kind of what kind is it uh put the next slider what why is he why

00:23:30.299 --> 00:23:35.940
is he at why is she asking fidra why is fidra asking hey what kind of drug you

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:42.960
got a Christ or a drinkable why does she say that it said Kristen

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:49.500
right I'm just using the words uh why did she say that because she

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:55.320
wanted a sex drug she wanted a sex drug with kind of a sex drug she want yup

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:01.500
leave it up this is a text she wanted a drug that was a filter

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.419
it was a filter that was

00:24:06.539 --> 00:24:13.260
this is a drug that is going to change the way that you

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:19.440
think and it's going to bend your mind to erotic desire

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:25.080
and she loved that it's going to bend your mind to erotic desire and the

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:30.659
reason she's feeders trying to get one of those drugs is because she wants to sleep with her stepson

00:24:30.659 --> 00:24:36.980
because he hippolytus is amazingly hot

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:42.960
mostly for the fact that he refuses to have anything to do with women

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:49.440
because he is a servant to the virgin that makes sense but you see what

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:55.440
happens when there's something about that Priestly collar that just calls it

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:01.919
just calls for some sort of Deliverance you know what I mean those of you who

00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:08.340
are not part of the the order of frustration um probably understand the power of

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:16.020
Seduction and why it is so devastating right you can cut that off and put a

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:23.460
collar on um you can marry a Baptist preacher or you can embrace it and build a temple

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:30.480
to Aphrodite it's up to you right you're purging the people the

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:37.320
whole purpose of the mystery is to purge the people to keep your citizens clean so that you

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.419
maintain your democracy makes sense doesn't it make sense love

00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:47.820
it let's go to the next next line we've got a I don't want to keep Gnostic too

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:53.340
long sitting over there like yeah yeah go ahead um no I want to get these screenshots

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:59.760
and by the way we're talking about sex drugs look what's going on here with Medea and Jason right there's a great

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:05.100
article written um by a professor in Georgia she's

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:10.740
writing about Medea and the prominence of Medea and Etruscan art and why it is

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:16.919
that she would you mean medeas got a following all the way over in Northern

00:26:16.919 --> 00:26:22.200
Italy uh yeah yeah Black Sea Babylon

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:29.400

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:36.900
right um we don't call the maids for any reason right let's jump oh I just wanted to show you

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:42.539
though you see what's going on that picture with Jason look what she's doing look what she's doing the scholar who

00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:49.380
wrote about this she's great too I wish I could remember her name um she I'll post it or something she was

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:55.200
talking about what's in this thing this offering dish that they're holding up to his mouth and why does he look like he's

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.919
half conscious and why is he naked they are naked the holy virgin in the

00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:08.400
middle isn't naked right media is not naked why is he what's going on is there

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:15.539
something something you know undercover yeah let's go to the next boom hit it

00:27:15.539 --> 00:27:21.960
Yep this is uh why don't we just look at what the Ancients said about cannabis

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.700
and what it is and where to find it

00:27:29.059 --> 00:27:36.419
he says this is a scythian which is uh what do you what is the

00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:43.980
thumiyama that's uh something that you're burning to offer or to enter into a state of

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:50.340
dialogue with the gods right isn't that nice something that you burn to enter

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:57.179
into dialogue with the gods that's what the scythians use it for fantastic let's see keep reading his definition would

00:27:57.179 --> 00:28:03.900
you fantastic yeah um it has this sort of power he says so

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:10.980
that X is what does it do it actually monzo go

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:19.740
down to the next next one yep what does it do it bleeds out it exudes it exudes

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:27.120
what is this word from right all right it's whoops threw me out I'll put the other there's one there it is

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.159
there we go exigmato look at that it's exuding it's

00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:38.520
exuding what is it it's the leaking out this moisture this moisture that's very

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:44.600
important right yeah causing to exude can you cause someone to exude something

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:52.820
yes you can what is the Cannabis do it causes you to exude what

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:58.860
next next slide sorry Chewie's looking at me like huh next slide

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:04.620
right after the definition that we just had right there it causes you to exude

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:10.200
this that which is arousing or inspiring

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:17.220
do you get it okay people take that down or you can leave it up do you get it does everybody get it just take a minute

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:24.000
there what does the Cannabis do cannabis allows you

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.940
to produce a milk what is that milk that is milk of

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:35.159
inspiration it allows you to take everything that

00:29:35.159 --> 00:29:41.120
inspires and bring It Forward yeah now some of you are saying who were who are

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:47.340
devotees of a Starion and the Throne of Satan some of you are saying well that's

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:52.620
a very clever description in just a couple of words for what the Cannabis is

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:59.700
known for doing and it's through the lens of antiquity it's through the lens of antiquity those

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:07.020
people that were standing at the foot of the cross when Jesus was yelling out oh Father forgive them for they know not

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:12.840
what they do after they arrest me with a naked boy in a public park

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.880
right he would know he would know how would Jesus know this

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:23.059
stuff Jesus's drug user you know Jesus was a drug user do I have to show you

00:30:23.059 --> 00:30:29.700
more of his to his depravity do I have to show you I do you want it

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:36.899
don't you this is like a dirty this is a dirty Show from from France

00:30:36.899 --> 00:30:42.840
this is a dirty 1930s French dance

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:49.679
it's what it is dance with these drugs and these sex acts that's the Bible though you have to get

00:30:49.679 --> 00:30:57.000
used to it you have to get used to it keep going we've got another one uh text wise yeah give me the next

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.320
yep I just want you to see this um before before we get there show the there okay this isn't Etruscan pot long

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:10.020
story short Etruscan pot central figure is Medea central figure is Medea you can

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:18.779
see written on the Kana that she's carrying and how do we know it's Akana because it says Khanna it's is it right

00:31:18.779 --> 00:31:23.880
you see it on the right there kind of and in the Etruscan mataya who there are

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:31.620
about four names for Medea and this is one of them I think this is the closest to the Greek mataya yep good fantastic

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:36.960
and go down to the Kana according to helmet Ricks which sounds like an

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:42.840
Affliction of the glands um Kana cannot be a local variant of

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:49.860
Etruscan color but it's different is a different word and homonymous you know so okay it's got the same sound what is

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:55.500
it uh Rex does not agree with attempt if so and so to connect Kana with the Greek

00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:02.760
Kana right read okay so you can see the philologists are

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:09.840
trying to figure out where where the word is coming from right okay but um but supports another hypothesis the same

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:18.000
author on the meaning of Kana as Kana beasts right the Greek word for cannabis

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.600
okay next next one fantastic um what is the last part of the kind of

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:30.559
beasts remember that the BDI

00:32:30.919 --> 00:32:39.659
remember that these guys hear that Bead video video videos we deal we Dale

00:32:39.659 --> 00:32:46.520
there's a Dior gamma somewhere hidden in there isn't there yes there is look at the bottom line weed we are

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:52.140
weed we are overseers what does that wind root mean it comes

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:58.140
down into Latin as wideo with dairy it's a sea right to see it's the diagram you

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:04.279
didn't know that six was in there that's 666 again right there it is

00:33:04.279 --> 00:33:10.200
gamma love it don't forget that it's the dye gamma and it's there and it's part

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:17.820
of the word for the cannabis it is that element which is giving us

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:25.340
sight there's a reason the dragons who guard thee who guard the relics smell

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:30.960
like cannabis there's a reason because it is in all of their instance

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:39.659
you can't get within 100 feet of that thing you can't when you're getting to the island the sailors do you know what this how the sailors find the island

00:33:39.659 --> 00:33:46.620
they say that they can smell it we're talking about Cyprus now you can smell Cypress before you can see

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:53.340

at least you'll smell better be able to take one of those baths that they take they took that Kana which the genius

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:20.898
Scholars say oh it's probably the talking about the fibers and turning them into

00:34:20.899 --> 00:34:27.060
Fabrics right from the Cannabis right of course that's in they were stupid right

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:32.099

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:52.619
call them alimas the magus because this is how his name bar Jesus

00:38:52.619 --> 00:38:58.980
is interpreted translated is rendered rendered probably the best

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:04.260
word for that yeah Jesus the magus

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:10.680
right that bar Jesus is the Magus it's what he just said this is how his name

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:16.140
is rendered they call him bar Jesus it means the magos

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:26.520
it means the magos because Jesus everybody knows is that mystery he is that power

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:32.280
yeah Jesus ain't his name Jesus is a title and by the time Jesus is using

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:37.320

way to read or what the Bible says in Acts that nobody else has said yes right

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:36.720
because we're lifting the text directly not presenting to you an argument

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:43.380
I have sources that classicists have that you're not going to find that

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:51.000
seminarians don't know right that's the whole point classical philology is guarding those texts I have

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:58.560
one that I'll just show you I'll just hold up hold it up right here look this is one

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:04.740
volume of the oxyrhancus papyri what are the Oxford rinkus papyri their papyri

that were found in a garbage dump in Egypt in a place called oxyrinkus

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:17.520
and late 1800s and they were looted by the by The Scholar thieves that you know

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:24.359
and this stuff was taken back to Oxford or and disseminated right for people to

00:42:24.359 --> 00:42:32.160

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:03.359
is an unknown some people think it could possibly be pindar or some people think it could be

00:43:03.359 --> 00:43:09.359

00:47:57.119 --> 00:48:00.500
what is a muse

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:08.180

erotica erotica no yeah oh I did the attic sorry oi yeah

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:25.740
this is the ahoidney song we also get epoid from this

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:33.300
that eponic or Magic song right we don't have a word for this in English take a

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:40.260
song the concept of singing and wet it to the performance of magic that alters

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:45.359
the universe around you and you get an epode

00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:52.020

great Queen welcome let's get Gnostic informant on here for some last uh some last minute I'm sorry

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:55.500
Gnostic for taking so long how are you doing no never rushed that was good I was enjoying the whole time good stuff

00:50:55.500 --> 00:51:00.780
good good what do you have what do you have uh in your brain since you're such

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:06.540
a powerful artist so how's your brain with with the Medea project and now

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:12.240
you're working on it without Medea I was thinking about what you're saying just now and you mentioned this bakic Empire

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:19.020
that existed at some point when we look at the sources we put two and two together what diadoris is saying what

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:25.440
Herodotus is saying what Homer's saying you get this picture of some sort of

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:31.859
cultural Empire that existed stretching from Beyond Babylon Eastern and all the

00:51:31.859 --> 00:51:37.260
way to you know past where the Etruscans are at you get in the Etruscan like the

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:42.960
vases you were showing you have media mataya in Etruscan and then you have the

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:48.180
medes claiming to call themselves medes based on Medea so there's some sort of

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:56.280
cultural Empire existing somewhere somewhere at the end of the Bronze Age and diadoris relates that it comes from

00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:02.280
this pharaoh who you know goes to war against the syrians and he leaves this

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:07.319
he plants this Kingdom up in the north in caucus and then the Egyptians pull

00:52:07.319 --> 00:52:13.619
out but that that Kingdom stays and I'm thinking to myself hmm that's interesting because Medea is so

00:52:13.619 --> 00:52:19.800
culturally important to all these places why and then I'm looking at the first chapter

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:25.619
well it's chapter two actually book one of Herodotus histories chapter 2 to

00:52:25.619 --> 00:52:31.260
chapter four first thing he writes about is the the Trojan War he's he's talking

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:36.839
about how how Hell loss came to be of course got to talk about the Trojan War but I didn't realize this until until

00:52:36.839 --> 00:52:43.200
last night before Helen gets captured well well actually the question is why

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:49.980
did Helen get captured well because she was so beautiful not really according to Herodotus people say it was a

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:57.240
retaliation of the Helens going to caucus and capturing Medea first

00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:03.960
and they captured Medea brought her to Argos and then in retaliation the

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:09.300
Trojans captured Helen so like whoa that changes the whole

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:14.400
story Medea is the cause of the Trojan War now and that's like the beginning of you

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:22.680
can't talk about Western Civilization without the Trojan War being in the beginning that's our Genesis right there and so Medea is so important to

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:29.280
everything like I mentioned the Etruscans are are putting her up as like a goddess almost and then I found this

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:34.559
out too talk about Boca Empire the the Grapevine and I have a screen

00:53:34.559 --> 00:53:39.839
ready to share if you want to pop that up real quick it's just it's just a it's just a Wikipedia article for great right

00:53:39.839 --> 00:53:46.800
but that it's actually an imported grapes are imported and planted they

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:52.020
didn't grow wild they only grew wild in one place and guess where that is

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:57.599
Georgia so the Grapevine grows wild where

00:53:57.599 --> 00:54:04.800
Medea's kingdom is so we're talking about this bakic Empire grapes are grown the grapes are native

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:11.520
to this place which means Bacchus is native to this place you have Bacchus and Medea both coming from this area and

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:17.400
the marriage and then we get this marriage of Bacchus and ariadne you were just talking about ariadnez the Madonna

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:23.819
well what is that that sounds like the formulation of kaikon mix the vine and the great uh the grape and

00:54:23.819 --> 00:54:30.240
the uh and the in the Madonna so there's some there's it's just fascinating when

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:35.579
you put it all together like that yeah isn't it and

00:54:35.579 --> 00:54:40.740
um the very fact that Medea could be that bakic uh voice it shouldn't

00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:48.420
surprise us the very fact that she's formulating bachic practice it shouldn't surprise us that in order to enter into

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:54.420
that Ecstasy of course the wine has to be full of something it has to have that

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:59.819
essence of the god and it only makes sense that this sorceress who knows so

00:54:59.819 --> 00:55:07.140
much about medicine and drugs that she's the one who's kind of pushing this why I

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:12.180
gotta ask you this Neil and this always bothers me why did why do we Overlook

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:19.619
that they were abducting her for a reason you don't sail halfway

00:55:19.619 --> 00:55:26.099
across the world and pick up a strange person and steal them yeah resources you

00:55:26.099 --> 00:55:32.520
don't waste you don't throw your Navy out there and risk them getting killed going to a foreign land just to capture

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:38.760
a random princess no no no she was valuable she has

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:45.180
knowledge she has resources she is like famous like think about Cleopatra's Fame

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:50.819
when they when they capture Cleopatra and they brought her back to Rome and they were going to kill her and all the

00:55:50.819 --> 00:55:56.339
Roman citizens are like no no don't kill her we will Revolt if you kill Cleopatra

00:55:56.339 --> 00:56:02.400
we're gonna we're gonna Revolt all of you will be dead they're like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we can't kill this woman let her go like

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:07.619
think about that but like I would say times 10 with Medea because Cleopatra

00:56:07.619 --> 00:56:13.800
yeah she's very prominent and she has kingdoms even like Syria and uh and and

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:21.900
I think southern turkey she had one of her sons planted over there but Medea's influence goes the entire Known World at

00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:27.780
the time the entire Bronze Age seems to be connected to Medea in some way so I

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:33.000
would say Medea is like Cleopatra times 10. and she and like and that's another

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.339
thing you mentioned the knowledge of the of the drugs that's probably like more

00:56:38.339 --> 00:56:45.420
valuable than gold well and remember the that drug knowledge is an arc of

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:52.380
evolution within the Warfare as well she she harnesses the power of the explosive

00:56:52.380 --> 00:57:01.619
power petroleum yeah and she ends up Petroleum in Georgia making the fire of Uranus right

00:57:01.619 --> 00:57:08.180
and the Greeks take this and turn it into a very formidable Naval Weapon

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:13.440
right and that they're very unwilling to talk about what is the secret we know

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:20.339
that the suited tells us that was Medea's fire that Greek Naval Weapon is originally in Medea's fire and she's

00:57:20.339 --> 00:57:25.440
making things explode she makes a princess burst into flames in public do

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:32.040
you know they heard about that all over the world they heard about that all over the world that vase that's in a truria

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:37.980
that's introveteri it was the Corinthians who colonized your veteri

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:45.780
and so they of course brought with them the the uh disaster that happened when

00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:53.760
they're King and their King's Daughter got emulated the suda even says that when the Greeks

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:59.220
when the it was the byzantines at the time when the byzantines were trying to find a way to defend themselves against

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:05.880
these uh Invaders they went to the ancient text and found a found some sort

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:11.160
of Fire processed and like you mentioned they they let you know this is an ancient

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:18.119
thing this isn't like a new thing they were going back to the ancient sources to find this stuff so and like for

00:58:18.119 --> 00:58:23.880
someone to get captured it started an entire war that Echoes all the way

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:29.700
through across centuries and it becomes the Central Foundation story of an

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:35.520
entire of an entire world basically something's going on there something is important

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:41.819
about that yeah and may the classicist hear our voice today because we don't

00:58:41.819 --> 00:58:48.359
think that bakic worship is anything but Greek right you say well it's very

00:58:48.359 --> 00:58:55.920
Oriental it's very strange yeah it was founded by a woman who lived up to the east of where the

00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:02.460
Greeks did you got that much right orientalizing yeah the Mysteries come out of there and out of Thrace right

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:08.099
work their way down so yeah it's fantastic I love the people

00:59:08.099 --> 00:59:16.740
don't reckon the influence that Medea had upon the world they don't understand all of that mystery is coming from one

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:22.619
woman why do you think the Christians take that figure and say this is the one

00:59:22.619 --> 00:59:30.000
that Jesu when he comes down on his golden bra is going to slaughter before he Slaughters the rest of us and the

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:36.540
blood is up to his horses right lovely you want to know why I think about that I'm so glad you brought that up because

00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:43.079
it's sort of a it's an inverse of the argonautica where the Jason there's you have two

00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:48.240
jasons now Jesus Jason and we know it's the same name one of them's Greek one of

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:55.020
them's Semitic whatever you want like different it's the same name it's Jason comes from Jake and so the Jason and the

00:59:55.020 --> 01:00:01.680
argotica goes to Medea with the Golden Fleece and the Jesus go and he gets

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:08.579
saved by Medea the other story is the Jason with the golden uh whatever

01:00:08.579 --> 01:00:14.819
um the golden wearing the golden robe going to slaughter her and now she's a witch now she's evil now it's she's lady

01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:21.240
Babylon so it's like a flipping of the polls happening they're reversing everything and that's why that's why you

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:26.520
get kelsus that's why calcus saying that this is a degradation of the of the of

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:33.059
the Mysteries that's what he calls Christianity and I think it's why Christianity is so brutally hard on drug

01:00:33.059 --> 01:00:38.579
use why they crack down and they start by telling their own people it's one of

01:00:38.579 --> 01:00:45.960
the oldest Christian references we've got and it says you've got to take the botany out of the communion you can't

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:51.540
have any drugs in the communion we gotta just go for the straight one and they

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:57.599
use that to bring break the Roman world's mystery Cults just the drugs

01:00:57.599 --> 01:01:03.780
themselves be and why is that fear of reconstructing the right there because

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:10.140
they know it can be done they know that they can enter into this mystery yet again yeah when people's minds are being

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:15.619
expanded by these by these drugs all of a sudden you you had your your your your

01:01:15.619 --> 01:01:21.180
opening yourself up to people that are going to revolt against you because like

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:26.520
it's easier to keep people enslaved mentally and emotionally if everybody's

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:32.099
sober and everybody believes in the same thing so and that's that that was the goal and

01:01:32.099 --> 01:01:40.020
that and you have to admit they were successful at it for like a thousand years all of Europe and Italy and Greece

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:45.839
was basically just following Christianity for a thousand years nobody like nobody there was nothing else going

01:01:45.839 --> 01:01:52.380
on unless you were Jewish or or a Muslim but that's it well there are a lot of wars

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:59.760
yeah and they all hated each other if they weren't if you weren't if you weren't Christian then you weren't hated so it was like there wasn't any I've

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:08.520
always I've always wanted to ask let's let's anger our our some of our viewers now and say why wasn't there a pox

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.680
um catholica there's a pox Ramana where they brought the Romans brought

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:19.920
civilization and people were saying yeah I want to become vote our people in to become you know

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:25.220
um uh Romans and they're spreading civilization and things are going great

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:31.859
right so we declared this is epox Romana this is a great Golden Age why don't we

01:02:31.859 --> 01:02:38.339
have epox catholica why don't we have the Christian church ever achieving a

01:02:38.339 --> 01:02:45.720
pox there's none there's nothing like that in fact if you're gonna if I was to argue if I had to pick it would be when

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:52.980
they start going back to the Greek mythology the Renaissance when they start painting Venus again that's when

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:59.220
start things start to get better isn't that weird when things start to get better is when they start going back to the ancient

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:04.980
myths again start painting Venus and Bacchus and putting them up on on in nice buildings with nice car but when

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:10.440
they start getting into the art again all of a sudden the world starts to change you get better isn't that something what does that tell you about

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:17.099
about the world about civil what does that tell you like it tells you a lot and if and eventually that Renaissance

01:03:17.099 --> 01:03:23.640
gives birth to democracy coming back to the terrestrial

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:30.780
plane democracy coming back and now we have the Democracy right and now we're

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:36.299
fighting to keep it right we're fighting to keep it what if I'm just going to ask

01:03:36.299 --> 01:03:42.960
you this what if it is not true that Christianity is is

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:48.599
the source of democracy what if it's true instead that Christianity was what

01:03:48.599 --> 01:03:55.740
killed democracy absolutely it brought back the Monarch you bring back the monarchy something that hasn't been seen

01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:03.900
since the the 30 tyrants were slayed by the by the Athenians when they replaced it with a 500 head Senate they called it

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:08.940
the boulay that was when they that was the end of type of tyranny for a long

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:16.380
time after that and it wasn't until Christianity comes along where they replace all that with an another

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:22.680
monarchy you know what I mean like I'll say this the Roman the Roman Imperial uh

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:27.720
way was sort of led into that don't get me wrong but Christianity the one God

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.940
and one Pope and one Emperor that's that that that mentality that patriarchal

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:39.780
mentality that's dark that's a dark world that everybody has to play a part you play your role you have to if you're

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:47.040
a man you have to do this if you're a woman you have to do this and women stay home and do that and man you go do this that's a dark world that's a that's like

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:53.460
a like it's like that's like the when you think of like the worst communist stick whatever like the worst

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:58.760
like you know Nazi Germany that's even worse than that yeah

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:04.140
like you mentioned when we start when people started to wake up again when people started to look back at the

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:09.540
ancient myths and of Venus and Bacchus and started getting in the art the Renaissance and the enlightenment all of

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:16.559
a sudden democracy comes back also in the world gets better what does that I mean like it's really that simple I really you can look at

01:05:16.559 --> 01:05:21.839
history that way I do yeah yeah no and that's Thomas you and

01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:29.160
me and Thomas Jefferson baby Thomas Paine let's let's ask Thomas Payne you want to invite him let's have a let's

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:35.119
have a lunch you and me promise me this promise me this you know you after death

01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:43.160

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:48.480
debate conversation and I'm you and I are gonna sit there and be you know

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:55.140
amazed but it you know I think they wouldn't be I think they wouldn't be too upset if we if we did that you know what

01:05:55.140 --> 01:06:00.720
I mean I mean everybody's gonna be there's gonna be a whole bunch of people with 70 virgins and there's going to be

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.760
a people right no no yeah let's go sit around let's find sappho we got to bring

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:10.799
Sapphire promise me we'll bring sappho just imagine just imagine being on the

01:06:10.799 --> 01:06:15.839
Island of Lesbos and you got sappho there and she's playing her her liar

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:23.880
she's telling the stories of Venus she's telling the story stories of Bacchus and and and and uh Medea too like just

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:30.660
imagine that site you know imagine that that world why would you want to eradicate that from society and and put

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:35.700
them put women in as nuns and you know Homemakers and like why would you want

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:43.440
to eradicate that from society I don't it's crazy it is notice that you have to you have to eradicate Venus so you don't

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:49.980
get that Taliban you don't get that Orthodoxy oh look you don't get that fundamentalism Venus becomes loose the

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:57.619
symbol of Lucifer yeah isn't that something what is I mean like it's it's so backwards yeah

01:06:57.619 --> 01:07:05.220
like love and beauty and fertility those those things that are become evil

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:10.680
and wicked and gross and Abominations those are the central things of Life

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:16.859
those are what we were that's what that's what we're like it's coded in our DNA to do

01:07:16.859 --> 01:07:22.680
like there's nothing else to live for besides love and fertility why would you want to make that is the

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:27.799
source of all evil you know why would you want to subject

01:07:27.799 --> 01:07:34.079
one gender to the other why would you want to say women obey your husbands

01:07:34.079 --> 01:07:40.740
Romans women obey your husbands and then women

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:46.680
should not speak in churches either that's Paul man he was right he was harsh yeah don't educate him either

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:53.640
right if they're not getting educated they can't be speaking anyway so you know what I mean yeah what is that Neil

01:07:53.640 --> 01:08:01.440
last question you tell me is that an imbalance in the universe when you try to construct a religion and a God and a

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:06.839
mystery around misogyny around

01:08:06.839 --> 01:08:13.740
taking one group of people and just subjugating them you know whether it be according to their color or their gender

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:19.020
or whatever it is that just unnatural and just drives us towards

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:24.060
self-destruction that's what I'm gonna say what do you say yeah yes but I the

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:32.460
reason why those type of worlds come about is because they they work for for a

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:39.600
small group of people a Priestly class for example in this situation becomes extremely powerful

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:45.838
and I'll just like throw an example out there like when Rome was being when all of Italy was being sacked by the French

01:08:45.839 --> 01:08:51.359
in the 16th century and bro like ever all of Italy is being subdued by France

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:57.600
Italy became part of France but Rome the the Vatican they live right through it

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:03.298
they were spared because that's the Holy See You can't touch the holy see you now

01:09:03.299 --> 01:09:09.420
politically you could control the holy see and you but you're not going to kill them they're going to stay billionaires

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:16.318
they're gonna stay in their Mansions you're going to conquer everything around them all the poor people that live around them are all dead but the

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:22.980
Holy See lives through everything they're still around today it's like there's they they created

01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:28.258
something then put themselves above civilization so it's very very hard to

01:09:28.259 --> 01:09:35.219
get rid of something like that once it starts very hard I think the right woman I think the right woman could do it and

01:09:35.219 --> 01:09:44.219
I think bring him back lady Babylon bring him back that history I think that's the only way to forge forward is

01:09:44.219 --> 01:09:50.699
to say what was it I know it sounds stupid Neil but what was it in the Bronze Age that was such created such a

01:09:50.699 --> 01:09:57.480
Renaissance it created such a movement forward in knowledge and research and in

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:04.080
technological development what was it that caused that push forward could it be because of a group could it be

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:10.199
because of an individual we know that thought revolutions that the industrial

01:10:10.199 --> 01:10:16.199
revolutions are always brought about by a group or an individual right it's

01:10:16.199 --> 01:10:21.300
scientists who are individuals who bring up the new you know Galilei oh my God

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:26.699
how did you well he's Copernicus but you know it takes those individuals to push

01:10:26.699 --> 01:10:33.960
forward and history was proof of that we wouldn't have we wouldn't have those Romans without Julius Caesar the great

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:39.960
child of Aphrodite we wouldn't have those things right so you can even it's

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:45.840
even someone like Caesar who's a conqueror still has to say I'm the son of Venus

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:51.239
you have to have that and you think of Athens with Athena in the Parthenon that

01:10:51.239 --> 01:10:57.300
giant statue golden and uh uh what's that white material that they use uh

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:02.699
Ivory Ivory and gold Athena sitting there the this giant and everybody that

01:11:02.699 --> 01:11:07.800
lives in Athens knows about this they could see it they can go and they can give offering they all had that image

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:14.400
that they represent and people are ever both both fast all the facets of society

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:20.699
are represented in some way they all have a God that they can look up to and re and and relate to whether that rather

01:11:20.699 --> 01:11:27.840
instead of just having one fatherly God that only only men can really look to say oh I'm like this God this guy loves

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:33.239
me because I'm like that God but those people who don't look like this God they don't have representation so they feel

01:11:33.239 --> 01:11:39.300
like they're less than but in the Greek world in the Greco-Roman world or even in the Indian oh going in the east in

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:46.320
the Indian uh Hindu Hindu pantheons you have gods that represent everybody everybody's has something to look up to

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.659
and has some sort of hero to look up to that makes your Society drive forward

01:11:51.659 --> 01:11:56.880
and the drugs too because you expand people's minds when people are I mean when you have that Festival that's

01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:03.239
another thing we can't forget about this when you go to that Festival every month and I don't maybe you had a terrible

01:12:03.239 --> 01:12:09.060
month you lost all your money maybe maybe some robbers came through and stole some stuff stole all your your

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:14.520
chickens and your and your goats and you your your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but you go to that Festival that's you know it's going to

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:20.280
come every month there's another Festival whether it's a festival a Demeter or the festival you know the bacchanalia every month you have a new

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:25.320
Festival to look forward to and you're gonna go there and you're gonna drink the kai Kion you're gonna have a good time you're gonna expand your mind

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:30.540
you're gonna forget about it and you're gonna reset yourself that's that part that part of society we still need to

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:36.739
bring back it's I think that people still people have that option now but I don't I think it should be like

01:12:36.739 --> 01:12:42.420
normalized people go to festivals Music Festival they come back and then change their lives oh my God I went to this

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:47.880
music festival and I'll never forget it it changed my life forever that type of mental that type of Spiritual Awakening

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:54.719
is a huge thing and everybody in Athens experienced that all right all right last question I'm

01:12:54.719 --> 01:13:01.260
Gonna Leave it to you Neil um you're working on a video about Medea just lead us out with that

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:06.719
yeah that's coming out in the next two days one one or two days Medea narrated

01:13:06.719 --> 01:13:15.239
by you edited by me with music and visuals um we got some some good visuals of not

01:13:15.239 --> 01:13:22.140
