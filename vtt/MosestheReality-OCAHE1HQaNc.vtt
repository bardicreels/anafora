a third Century Construction of museus right um so the author of The

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.240
Bible who's writing in the third Century they are pulling down the tradition that

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.680
is the orphic mystery tradition the oracular tradition right coming through

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:24.800

you know doing his thing with his sheep and all of a sudden what happens to

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:44.280
Moses all of a sudden he finds that bush that bush that burns but it doesn't stop

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.400

where Moses has gotten to and tonight tonight we are going to learn the

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:10.080
name of Jehovah we're going to learn the name of yaho we're going to learn it are

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:16.560

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:30.120
pleasure to be able to bring it to you it's gorgeous let's go um hit me with

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.680
this first text I'm just gonna read it to you people yeah so he says look look

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.319
it's Mo and God and they're sitting there with the fumes of this thing

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:46.400
fumigating themselves he says look nobody's going to believe me nobody's

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:54.639
gonna believe me if I go back and tell them I spoke with God right and then what am I gonna do and so cuos turns to

00:07:54.639 --> 00:08:02.520
him and he says from the you know he's speaking where is he speaking by the way he's speaking out of the smoke mayy t s

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:10.000
you know what's in your hand what's in your hand bra and he says a Robos Moses

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.479
says a Robos is in my hand go to the next one wait a minute what's Moses walking around with what's he walking

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:23.520
around with here put this thing up there and people don't understand now again we're going to get into the fact that

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:30.440
this is so complex and the Hebrew is so simple right you're pulling out a layer of technicality right when you have to

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:38.479
translate the Greek to the Hebrew so that's what's happening here and what is this rdon look it's a rod people look at

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:46.320
all the different types of things that it is we'll look at number one the magic wand look at the fishing rod oh yeah

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:53.519
look at this this is gorgeous yeah yeah the rapsod carries this thing around who is

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:59.440
the rap sod that's the singer that's the singer bro you didn't think s was a he

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:06.120
Hebrew word did you it's a Greek word um um yeah fantastic so this robon hit me

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:13.200
with the next hit me with the next uh example what is this thing Moses is carrying well let's look at it's early

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.560
prototype right now this is the magic wand that's used by Cersei so and

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:25.399
everybody's watching Harry Potter and they're like oh Harry you're your wand baby Point

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:31.800
your wand point it right at Hermione don't do that don't do that don't point

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:38.040
that W Harry stop um this is the one that Cersei is

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:45.360
using and she is using it in an archaic um Bronze Age late Bronze Age

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:53.000
form and what does this thing do this thing's a vehicle for her to

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.279
transform a person from a sentient to an

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:07.680
incentient yes a toy if you will isn't that neat that's Bronze Age stuff that's

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.640
Bronze Age stuff this is a tool remember you doctors when you go to work what is

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:20.160
your symbol it is this thing with a serpent wrapped around it Oh you mean

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:27.279
this thing is medical yes yes and remember please remember please that there are ways to introduce drugs to the

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:35.320
human body in the ancient world and one of them is on board a thing that you and I today the

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:42.880
proper terminology would be something like medicated dildo and so here we have it here we

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.639
have it who uses these things back to the back to the Cersei bit yes love it

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:54.560
people look at this that's in the Odyssey that's in the Odyssey let's float a little bit look the thing which

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.600
Athena touched to thisius seriously

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.480
seriously did you know that Athena was touching

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:14.279
Odus she touched him with her golden robon and what happens when you touch

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:21.440
Odus with your golden robon ah he looks younger he looks

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.639
younger yeah you remember the Imperial thcs you know what do you think that

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:34.320
technology was developed right oh God this is lovely okay let's

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:41.000
bring back the text this too much that got a little bit too season season too much seasoning look what Athena did this

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.079
is her golden robon that she's going to be applying to

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:51.600
adicus yeah that verb there it means that she's applying

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:58.959
it yeah yeah she is covering it yeah she is

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:05.240
doing doing it she's doing that Mistress of the Arts the Medical Arts thing go

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:10.360
and what else can you do with the robone like the one Moses has got in Antiquity

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.600
you know what can you do with one in the third Century especially tell us what

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:22.440
tell us bring us to the third Century um look Hermes lifted up his

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:32.519
robone the one that he uses to felgo your eyes to thalgo your eyes yes he

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:37.720
uses it to thalgo you what is that that's when somebody takes over your

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.800
mind have you ever had somebody take over your mind and introduce thoughts

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:48.519
and you say that sounds quite crazy and somewhat ridiculous well it turns out

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:56.160
Manfred whenever they have drug parties of this magnitude and Excellence that um

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:04.240
there is a little bit of programming that can be done fantastic you know how long you can keep somebody in a

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:12.480
cage yeah wait a minute is this the Bronze Age yeah it's the time that they're figuring out when all of these

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.199
um dotes and antidotes will work with and against each other right so yeah

00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:25.240
good when remember Master Formula kind of stuff um go to the back to this one

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:34.480
look who is it who is it who's got the thing it's Hermes right it's the angulos remember the text tells us that

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:42.040
Moses was visited by an angulos in that bush that

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:49.639
burned it was visited where was that angulos within the flocks within the flocks

00:13:49.639 --> 00:13:55.320
BOS oh God oh God are you beginning to

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:00.839
see what that Angelos does you begin to see it look at Moses

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:05.880
everybody we all got off the time ship so fast we all you know here it is were

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:11.079
you surprised that Moses is heavy heavy heavy into drugs are you

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:18.560
surprised yeah not only that he's into the good ones watch what he's about to do this guy is a Tripper he is a Tripper

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:24.720
out there and I wanted you to see this because I want you to put Moses and Jesus right next to each other and

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.000
remember I'm going to ask you how much time separates Moses from from Jesus

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.440
well in the fairy tale world it's a thousand or so years um in history it's

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.880
only about 250 to 300 years separates

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:49.600
the two right Moses as a creation of the third Century as a knockoff of

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:56.000
museus right this character is already established this Prophet is already there why do you think there are songs

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.399
of Moses right we are working for from a thirr century environment so what we are

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:07.839
seeing in the 3rd century is being sucked into our fabrication did he just

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:15.759
call the Old Testament a fabrication yes he did he did in a poorly done

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:22.199
translation oh god what happened to the scholars this brain drain or something I

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:29.480
don't know um the garans usually have their stuff

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:35.839
together so let's stick with them let's stick with those Greek garans and see what they recording all of okay give me

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:44.000
the next one what is the what is the rdon in the on the Hebrew side surely

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.680
this is the source wait a minute a staff this is the mate and what is this a staff a raw a shaft

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:59.040
branch and then metaphorically a tribe okay there's not does everybody

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.560
see how the depth we've gone now from the depths to the kidy pool we're now at

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:59.199
whoops we need to go back to the previous text Chey I'm sorry what happens um uh nope one more that's the

00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:05.720
boom um yeah what else does the angulos that comes out of the Bush out of that

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:12.839
pure out of that flock that lightning that Uranian power right and if you

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:18.558
don't know what I'm talking about it's because you haven't seen him do it right you haven't seen him do the right don't

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:25.400
worry you catch up um but here's um the angel and once the Angels saying um they

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:33.559
not only um take control of your eyes but what do

00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:38.840
they do um they raise those who are

sleeping yeah they resurrect those who are

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:50.240
sleeping yes now you know why the discussion I bring the Greek to people

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:56.760
the more people say oh that makes more sense that makes more sense that that's how they right the fairy tale actually

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:02.480
doesn't make sense right it's the and you know that's what the naked kid with

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:10.280
Jesus does when Jesus was arrested in a public park at 4:00 a.m. with a naked boy screaming I'm not a trafficker um

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:18.600
when when the SWAT team took him him down um there was no question about what

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:25.360
he was actually doing that rap that was on that kid's private parts that naked

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:32.679

God himself are you ready I'm not talking I'm not talking Zeus either

00:24:38.679 --> 00:24:44.080
right Zeus is one of many just as Ammon is the

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:50.880
eighth and remember you can always have a rebellion Against The Gods and you can

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.960
take that monest that monest

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:01.880
monstrosity and turn it into a historical reality like they did under

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:07.320
aanan and do you know what they did they made that one God

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:15.399
monstrosity that monest monstrosity that as soon as aanan bit it they broke down

00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:22.559
all its monuments and they said we're going back to Ammon we're going back to the eighth

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:28.399
why was that so critical for the sake of all the gods

00:25:28.399 --> 00:25:33.640
God's like justice why was that so critical why did

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:39.159
that restore what the Egyptians had already had it's the same thing that

00:25:39.159 --> 00:25:48.320
drags down it's the same power that drags down classical wisdom you cannot mingle classical

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.640
wisdom and any monest belief you can't

00:25:53.640 --> 00:26:01.600
they don't work together right they're they will destroy um each other or one will get the upper

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:08.480
hand yeah but somebody's going down they cannot coexist it is a

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:14.399
monstrosity Frankenstein it's very Franken steinan that's fantastic that's

00:26:14.399 --> 00:26:21.080
not a word go that's not what they meant when they said you must coin so many words it's not what they meant um tell

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:26.559
me Yahoo what did you say remember um he

00:26:26.679 --> 00:26:34.000
said oh doesn't that sound nice you before I tell you what that means go to the next one because what did what could

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.840
the Hebrew language do with that the Hebrew language just put that verb I am

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:48.679
and then who some kind of relative and Then followed by the same verb again I am right okay I am who I am and that's

00:26:48.679 --> 00:26:54.440
how it ends up in all of the translations take down that's how it ends up in all of the English

00:26:54.440 --> 00:27:02.000
translations sounds very Popeyes uh right I I am what I am right

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.640
that is not what the Greek says as you can see even if you don't know Greek you can see oh it's different it's not just

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:15.480
one word repeated twice right remember when you're going from ancient

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:24.520
Hebrew to ancient Greek you are stepping up the level of technical

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:31.600
difficulty right the Hebrew sentence there is a quick run jumping maybe a couple of

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:37.960
twists right the Greek is a lengthy routine look at the look at what they've

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:43.960
done with it right so I am what I am um is the Hebrew side not ready for the

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:50.640
word the actual the original words of God are you ready I

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:56.120
am the being I am

00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:02.559
being I am being thank for think about the difference there I am that I am like

00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:07.720
Gangsta gangster yah says I am what I am

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:14.840
baby right you can see that you can respect that right what do we give that judges what do we give ah it's a

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:21.960
7.5 7.5 watch the artistic detail the technical do you know what the H on is

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:27.880
look at what this is first of all the first thing we have here is ago and ago is a personal pronoun you don't have to

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:33.360
use that in ancient Greek the personal pronouns are used like for

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:42.360
emphasis ownership right it's not just something being done I'm the one doing it me and

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:51.000
you know what he says he says I am ha on who is he saying he is he says he is

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:01.720
the one we get a definite article H and then we get on the participle the one being I am the being

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:07.559
I am the act itself of existence which if you think about it

00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:15.360
has a kind of a much larger reach than I'm whatever I am baby right The Gangsta

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:20.720
gangster yah is little bit over the top that way right very tribal has a very

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:27.440
tribal taste to it you know and the level of technology is a little bit lower it's a little bit you know there's

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:35.600
a reason and they sent Jesus to Egypt to get educated right with all that money there's a reason he did right it's just

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:42.720
CU things were not good libraries were not were not up and running yeah yeah

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:49.799
it's a shame um but everybody knew that about the province right okay so it's

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:55.960
just the way it is it's a fragment of History down there in Alexandria they were kicking everybody's butt don't get

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:01.399
me wrong in Alexandria woo that's where it was all happening that stuff just

00:30:01.399 --> 00:30:09.159
sucked in the world right how can you come stand next to that you cannot give me the next one

00:30:09.159 --> 00:30:14.440
give me the next one oh yeah there we go um so here he said this thing that I

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:22.720
just told you I am being I am being this is my on I onion

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:29.960
this is my what name this is my ionic name now um how did the Hebrew handle

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:37.200
this how did the Hebrew handle this and take every everything off track after it with it all the English translations are

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:44.200
going to follow this right um look at Forever at the end yeah Le right last

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.279
time I saw that's what it meant yeah right fantastic is that what is that

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:57.399
what ionian means no no and they have those words they have several for

00:30:57.399 --> 00:31:03.480
something Goes On Without End yeah and it usually has a form of a a on it

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:09.799
because you there's a lot of different dialects they're developing so you get a lot of you know sometimes some repeat so

00:31:09.799 --> 00:31:16.639
yeah um this is not it though ionian what is ionian look you and I are gonna

00:31:16.639 --> 00:31:25.320
go to the synagogue from the second century and I want you to look at it okay we you and I are in a second

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:30.760
century synagogue and do you know who is on the

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:38.799
walls ion because we know what ionic life

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:45.840
is Ion stands there and around him is this ribbon and that

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:52.840
ribbon has 12 distinct separations on it each of those separations is a house you

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:59.880
mean wait an astrological stuff you mean the first Jews were a astrologers yes

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:07.600
it's a huge part of why you have a sunog why you have a synagogue that's a

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:15.519
Greek word it's a Greek word yes so um they're doing astrology

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:20.880
isn't that fantastic astrology and the Romans by the

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:27.159
way Romans get a little bit upset about that and they have several decrees and

00:32:27.159 --> 00:32:33.039
it's kind of weird to read them the first time I read one I was like what um

00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:39.760
it's a decree to Exile all the astrologers and

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:47.279
Jews it's almost like they're an astrological sect not an

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:54.240
ethnicity that's how the Romans are treating it yeah Romans have something against those astrologers you know why

00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:01.760
it was rubbing up it always does it rubs up against rulership right yeah because you can take

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:07.919
somebody's birth and blow it up and determine everything yeah you know what happens

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:13.360
that stuff always happens next thing you know some kind of insurrection you can't

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:19.679
tolerate that you have to kick out those astrologers yeah that's the Roman the

00:33:19.679 --> 00:33:25.880
Roman way okay thank you Rome I I kind of get it I kind of understand where

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.960
you're going because you're looking at it for from a from a Civic kind of

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:36.279
standpoint um I understand but um I never really got why you Associated

00:33:36.279 --> 00:33:43.279
those too until until I realize that the texts are all um you'll see throughout

00:33:43.279 --> 00:33:51.799
any time that we study the septu agent you're going to be shocked at how much of the astrology tech there is there oh

00:33:51.799 --> 00:33:59.880
how much of it stains so don't be surprised they're worrying they're worshiping Ion on the war wall right on

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:07.279
the wall second century we've been there we've seen them look them up look them up um and there we are okay so what is

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:12.679
my ionic name if you can remember the last passage we looked at Livia with the

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:18.398
oh I'm sorry that was a slip the impress right we're talking about the impress

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:24.800
anyway this is my ionic name this is my

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:32.079
ionian name what is the ionian thing that what what is that tell pray tell me Alan Alan hotep where is that guy he

00:34:32.079 --> 00:34:39.118
changed his name by the way Tuton Amon um changed his name from tutank attin

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:45.000
because of the whole way that monotheism dragged the Egyptians into the dirt yeah

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.480
fantastic so what is that ionian go down I think it's this one yep boom um this

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:58.480
word ion we are here um with ion what

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:03.839
are we doing with ion we are mourning we are mourning wait a minute

00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:11.160
wait a minute is anybody does anybody smell Adonis yes yes now you know why we have

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:18.160
to take the name Adonis and we have to say no this is not actually a Greek plasan but it's blah blah blah and we

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:25.800
have to come up with our own Roots that's what we're doing when we back translate when we create a text um that

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:31.560
we're going to claim as a translation right uh that's what we have to do that's the tools that we have to work

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:37.440
with um it's like you're working from your own prison so so to speak you've

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:44.760
painted yourself into a corner linguistically and this is what we have to do what is what is the ion what is it

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:50.520
really coming from right if it's not meaning this always and for all time

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:57.079
it's the groan that we have it's the morning that we have for Adonis it's the

00:35:57.079 --> 00:36:07.119

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:18.760
K is it's equivalent with a very a a very um uh dystopic switching of

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:24.599
consonant jumping one of them jumps in front of the other one was like that but you look at the victorians if you don't

00:37:24.599 --> 00:37:29.920
believe me go to Alice and Wonderland look at the victorians and see what they

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:35.640
say about KES what is KES it's not only the name

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:40.920
of media it is also the name of the

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:48.200
purple isn't that nice isn't that nice it's the name of the purple all of this

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:54.839
cult that we have tried to cut away the false Hebrew to look at the original

00:37:54.839 --> 00:38:01.560
Greek all of this cult has led us right back to that original mystery this is

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:06.760
the reason that media's students the Magi um came after

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:13.160
Jesus yeah they saw his star now do you know what it

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:18.400
means yeah Jesus by the way what I want

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:25.160
you is we're thinking about Moses entering into these drug rights right remember the Egyptians catch up the

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:31.520
Egyptians catch up they do the same thing the very same thing they make that

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.800
draon right why because they knew what holding up the serpent meant which by

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:41.920
the way is Jesus itching his belly around here somewhere that's why he wasn't pitching because he was a belly

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:48.800
itcher go um don't you remember that keep going there we go yep let's try

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:54.319
that one um here's some VAR no that's always variations of it it's not we

00:38:54.319 --> 00:39:00.480
we're past that what else does um God want us to do by the way we're still in

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:07.920
the fog does anybody feel it I feel a little bit of the effects we're still in that fog and what is that fog making us

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:14.000
think well God is telling us plunder the Egyptians right plunder

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:21.560
him wait a minute he's using a term that reflects the activities of

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:29.040
AAS oh my goodness

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:34.760
now don't lose it remember this is the third Century right so where do you

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:41.680
think where do you think they're getting their images from it's what's in the environment around them yeah love it

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:49.200
love it plunder the egyptions says the lace Moses is like dog this guy is down

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:56.400

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:02.680
there's not much yeah good look what you do you take from your enemy you plunder from your enemy right cuz that's what we

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:09.920
got going on here we got Warfare going on and he says what's in your hand what's in your hand and he says rdos

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:16.920
wait a minute haven't we been here this is Robos right I'm just catching us up and go to the next one Jesus oh I knew

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:21.040
it Jesus was gonna be dragged into

00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:33.280
this oh God God oh God Jesus speak up Jesus remember I just used the Greek

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:39.560
word ofus right um for that serpent that serpent specifically the one that's in

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:47.319
the garden this is the office that opens your eyes

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:53.000
right yeah um and here he is Jesus tell us what are we going to do we're going

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.280
to elevate or introduce the use of those serpents and if you drink a thoso a

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:05.359
death inducer it's not going to hurt you and you will

00:41:05.359 --> 00:41:11.800
heal other people okay are you ready for what the

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:17.280
cult is doing how do you think that we come to those Visionary States look at

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:24.960
what he's saying Jesus is saying right and by the way if you are a Christian today and you do not understand the use

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:32.280
of compound concoction of Venoms and how it is that that brings you through death

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:38.359
to be reborn again um you don't understand you don't know the ionian

00:41:38.359 --> 00:41:45.160
name you just don't know it you don't know the being do you understand no they

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:50.760
see that's the point you're doomed you're doomed not to Isn't that cool and

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:56.960
that allows the Christ to select to be very selective with initiations because

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:03.880
there's only some of us who have ears to hear everybody else is going to get slaughtered do you see the monest

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:09.960
Tendencies do you see how destructive the monest Tendencies are oh it's

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:17.760
fantastic let's go um yeah let's go to the next one quickly here quickly um I want you to be reading this story as I'm

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:23.079
as I'm translating right what's God gonna do what else gone please tell me

00:42:23.079 --> 00:42:29.640
from the bush tell me I'm going to open your mouth I'm going to open your mouth what are you gon to put in my mouth God

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:38.559
remember the only place on God that museus I'm sorry that Moses

00:42:38.559 --> 00:42:44.920
ever gets to see is his

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.520
butex yeah you mean Moses saw Yahoo's

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:56.000
anus yeah he did he had to be put it's

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:04.240
so powerful to see the anus of Jehovah it is so powerful you got to be

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:09.880
put into a rock right they're gonna have to cement you in there because it's boom

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:17.640
when you see that thing walkon boom he's like look I'm gonna put you in this Rock right now I don't know how much of that

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:22.960
burning bush is taking its effect I don't know what we did with that Venom

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:28.880
in that robone and all I remember was you told me to try to pick it up by

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:36.559
something to pick it up by something and that something in the creek is a mem

00:43:36.559 --> 00:43:44.599
weay wait what yes God said Reach Out Moses reach out your hand and grab grab

00:43:44.599 --> 00:43:52.000
the dragon's male member grab the the reason we have to have the mem we in

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.240
Latin is because you would be shocked that Moses and God are sitting there

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:04.440
talking about a a penis and God is like reach out and grab

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:10.040
it right the Egyptians are doing the same thing don't be

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:17.400
shocked okay the text openly says those F Cas those um it's often translated as

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:22.480
Sorcerers but it's sorcerer doesn't you know sorcerer is Harry Potter right it's

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:28.000
Fantasy Land these are people who have immense drug knowledge and not in a nice

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.359
so way they're aggressive right they get involved in governments right that kind

00:44:34.359 --> 00:44:39.599
of approach that kind of cult that's why even the Romans at one point like oh

00:44:39.599 --> 00:44:45.359
this cannot go on these Bonet they have to be stopped right you're like what the

00:44:45.359 --> 00:44:52.200
Romans persecuted bans I thought I thought they yeah no they did because

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:57.480
there's a power there's a power to the Bic

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:05.880
mystery when you have those churches they take power yeah it's how it is bro

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:11.240
it's how it is it's just a taste of monotheism right just it's released as

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:18.400
soon as you stop the strangle hold right just it's just that Sphinx right you know I'm gonna strangle right that's

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:24.280
what it's it's that moment yeah thunder struck remember we're getting thunder

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:29.599
struck yeah fantastic um go to the next one let's get a little bit more of the

00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:35.559
story just some of the salacious stuff yep somewhere down there right he's

00:45:35.559 --> 00:45:42.520
gonna put in his what is he gonna put in his mouth go down here go down here he's gonna put no no um yeah yeah he's gonna

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:48.000
open his mouth and he's gonna he's gonna really apply it you know what I mean what's what's Jehovah putting in my

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.920
mouth he's putting the remata there you can see it all right so remember what do

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:59.599
you do with the wand you capture and control somebody's

00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:07.280
thoughts and what do you put into their mouth you know you put the sayings you

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:14.280
put the words that are going to come right out right out it's very it's basically just essential you know

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:20.400
sophisticated chemical programming we're not doing anything different from what Cersei was doing but Cersei figured out

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:26.160
a way how to turn a dude into a total slave and make him like a Sex Fiend

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:32.920
isn't that nice just for toy for whenever you you wanted to otherwise you're giving them drugs to pacify them

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:41.040
right Isn't that cool that's kind of yeah all you got to do is you got to give them that one combo that makes them

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:48.800
enter death and then you bring them back as soon as you do that they're so grateful right that you become a

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:57.200
gatekeeper right remember John CTI says Cersei went back to find odyusa

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:03.880
he said went back to find aysus and um it says um C says she killed him and

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:10.319
resurrected him yeah yeah she was restarting she was restarting something

00:47:10.319 --> 00:47:16.079

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:06.160
of the brightness in Jesus's life is it maybe in the end when he saying I don't want to drink this cup because he had to

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:12.000
drink his communion right out of that kid's private parts the purple is going

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.160

Exiles not like they were the only people ever right it's happening all the time it's movements migrations of people

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:51.000
right disturbances Civic disturbances and migrations um and he says that the

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:58.880
Jews were one of these migrations and they originally came from CRE and that they threw on off the worship of the

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:05.880
Ammon the eth remember the eth that we're looking for in the apocalypse he
