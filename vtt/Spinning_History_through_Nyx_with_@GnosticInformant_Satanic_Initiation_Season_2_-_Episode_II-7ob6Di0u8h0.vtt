[Music]

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.660
all right let's get started here I'm going to show you a very short little video here that I've put together with

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.780
another great song from Zane Campbell um but before I do that I just want to

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.620
introduce you to somebody named hermotimus who is this guy hermotismus

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:34.319
his name means honor of Hermes right isn't that nice hermotimus honor to

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.540
Hermes so of course that's where we begin um

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:48.599
you need to see him uh and what I dug out for you from the corpus metachorum

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:57.239
gricorum it's in a section on almonds notes

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.640
I I rather like that and

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.099
I asked for mathematics I want to show you that Source now so

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:14.180
that we can visit with a dead

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.519
devotee of Hermes yes and so that we can

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.980
um understand the initiation yeah fantastic

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.400
let's go ahead and bring this up um no let's go ahead and start with the video cue the video please oh actually

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.500
go back yes I'm sorry we should do the text first text first

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:46.319
yes so this is I'm just going to translate this to you quickly reading it off my screen to you yeah so

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:54.060
um these things are said about um hermodimus yeah the classmenian

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.480
you know they say that his soul was separated from his body and went

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.500
around you know a long time and was able to locate itself in

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.000
different places and to prophesy or to tell the things that were about to happen

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.299
to the people there for example he could talk about whether it was going

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.900
to flood or whether there was going to be no flood whatsoever maybe drowned

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.740
whether there was going to be some kind of seismic activity or whether there was a plague coming

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.460
yeah such things you know such things now he did this with his

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.479
body laying there yeah they say his soul

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.759
came back into his body like it was a sheath

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:58.800
and it revived the body huh

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.220
yeah so he would do this thing quite frequently and he told his wife

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.919
certain commands that when he was going into the separation

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:18.000
that she shouldn't touch any part of his body and she shouldn't let anybody else of

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.680
the citizens the locals don't let them touch it and certainly not any other men

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.100
but these guys came into his house one day and they were pushing his wife

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.979
and she showed them and there he was lying on the floor naked

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.139
totally Motionless so what did they do

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.840
they picked up fire and they totally burned his body

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.280
you know why because they thought since his soul had separated

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.419
it wouldn't be able to return and that his life would reach its ending

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:11.220
and uh yeah so it happened now the class of minions even up to

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:18.600
today when you and I are talking they reverence

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.520
hermosamus they even built the temple for him

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.740
yeah and then they forbid that any woman should ever enter it

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.220
because of what I just told you

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:44.720
there are going to be images here which I need you as the congregation to be

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.039
absorbing to be taking in um Pythagoras

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:55.500
said hermotismus was his previous

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:03.060
was his previous incarnation yeah that his soul CK was the same

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:10.500
so this fascinating art of being able to project oneself across

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:19.979
time and space outside of a corporeal form to the extent that you can your

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:28.259
adolon actively appears and teaches

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:36.660
the future yeah this is Pythagoras you know right up he's he's on it and he's right in

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:42.419
this saturnian Gap and that's where we need to be in that saturnian Gap we have

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:48.120
somebody tonight in that Gap um coming on in just a minute

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.160
yeah yeah so I wanted you to I really wanted you to ground yourselves tonight

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.560
let's watch this video and then discuss a couple of images and immediately we'll

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:32.820
introduce and bring on now it's the conformant [Music]

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:42.220
1000 times [Music]

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:57.320
[Music]

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:03.720
and I know it walks with me

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.889
instead [Music]

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:18.980
never gave me peace [Music]

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:37.260
[Applause] [Music]

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:48.540
me [Music]

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.500
imagine things

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:59.620
[Music]

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.740
[Music] reason governs substance

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:15.899
that's what her motimus was contributing that there is a Quantum universe that

00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:22.560
exists and that you can create

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:28.620
within that universe that it is mind

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:34.620
it is mind that acts upon the substance

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:41.459
yeah hermosamus that's quite revolutionary did they burn you

00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:46.980
yes they've burned him they've burned him alive

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:53.579
it's a good thing it makes you wonder what happened to him as he was out because you know if he was

00:10:53.579 --> 00:11:02.519
like in pedicles you know he could go to sleep for 47 years 56 years whatever it was

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:07.800
yeah and um come back he could move through time like that

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:15.120
yeah these are the Builders of your true civilization

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:21.600
yeah we are going to look at some hymns but first

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:28.800
we're going to do it through Neil so I would like to welcome before

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.620
we before Neil opens his mouth I would like to introduce

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:43.680
I would like to introduce him as a new man with regards to one thing and one thing

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.079
alone um before he was goat feces right but

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:55.079
now he possesses a name he possesses a name

00:11:55.079 --> 00:12:02.660
that's right he was able to work he was able to work

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.279
through the rights he was able to skim them just

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:16.380
just with his own you know I I wasn't going to do it for him and to be honest Neil I got I got to

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:23.279
tell you your final find I did not think you would make it by tonight I didn't I was dreading I was like I don't think he

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:29.220
is so now after the pseudo Knicks thing you didn't have the faith in me after that yeah yeah

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:35.220
yeah I knew that I knew that it would be great to have you so that you could talk about can you start us from the

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:40.860
beginning can you tell us about casting out demons can you tell us about

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:46.680
purification can you tell us about um those powers that you're interacting

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.899
can you tell us about Mania can you tell us about Mania can you

00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:58.880
um uh can you make us comfortable with your Herculean

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:04.980
cross-dressing Mania that's the whole point is to enter into

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:11.579
the Mania and to harness that energy and to hold on to it and then to focus it on

00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:17.700
the image of the Goddess NYX and pseudo Knicks that means the image of the

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:24.360
Knicks of the image of night and uh sometimes you might need a little boost which is you know so Ayahuasca or some

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:31.980
kaikon or something that gets you in that Mania and then then that's you see this even even outside of uh the

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:37.440
Mysteries even Christianity you see this in the church as people are speaking in tongues they don't know why that's

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:45.480
working they think it's Jesus doing it to them but no that's the spirit of the bakoy that's the Mania that's the frenzy

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:51.720
that's what that is so Neil could you tell us about working

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:57.959
with some of those images you you went to the thesmaphoria you went to the

00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:05.160
phasma for you and I can tell you confidently from the Throne of Satan knowing with the congregation knowing

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:10.500
what that is um uh we we went to the thesmaphoria

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:16.440
together and um tell me about tell me about the Korra and tell me about be you

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:22.279
boolius will you for a second and witness to what's going on

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:28.860
ah the the dawn it's that Dawn energy if you know if I want you guys to pay

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:36.360
attention to something if you have a chance to get out at dawn 5 a.m and just take in the atmosphere

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:42.839
there's an energy there's a magic in the atmosphere the Dawnbreaker Lucifer the

00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:48.839
the the bringer of light out of the darkness that is the most psychedelic

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:55.260
time of the 24-hour period and that is the most that is the time where you're

00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:00.899
closest to if you want to say this is how I'm going to interpret it because hard language is hard to express this

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:06.240
but I but I guess the best way to explain it would be that is the time where you're closest between here and

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:12.660
Hades Hades is closer at that time your the portals opened up that is the

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:19.860
time to be to be to be doing your get your hem out get your hand to Nicks out get your hem to Bacchus out and do the

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:25.740
him do you feel that's that's the time to do it that's the the the the the dawn

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:31.980
time the light the Lucifer bringing bringing Lucifer from your head that's what it says in the in the Hercules his

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:37.079
head was Rising with the light which was the last word that you told me

00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:42.779
to look for which I was blown away by because I mean look at the English it's not there you read the you you know a

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:48.300
little bit of Greek enough to translate just enough to look up each word oh I can read the word and look it up that's

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:54.000
all you need to do because you can go word by word and you'll find it you'll find and this is this is one of the

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.839
things about the Greek tool is you're you become your own translator you don't need Thomas Taylor anymore you pull out

00:16:00.839 --> 00:16:06.180
the Greek you read the Greek and then you can translate it yourself and interpret it your own way and Something

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:11.940
Something Magic about that yeah hey that's uh hey all of you have

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:19.260
heard that don't forget that and there's no charge that you're not going to spit use that as currency no because those

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:26.040
are holy words right we're guardians of those things Neil possesses the sacred

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:32.639
name he looks into the hymn right and people don't realize it Neil isn't it funny once you realize how the hymns

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:38.339
work within the magic isn't it funny that um before you saw it as just the you

00:16:38.339 --> 00:16:44.160
know you've been to church and you've had hymns you've like him this is yeah

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:49.220
yeah this is um the power transfer is

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:55.680
amazing and now you are in night you are in Black Knight and you're standing you

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:01.380
as Heracles were searching I gave Neil um um

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:06.418
the search which he's which is now profaning right we're bringing to you

00:17:06.419 --> 00:17:12.780
the actions to bring it to you so live this through Neil the initiate

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:19.260
um I wasn't going to do this if he couldn't unlock that door he found the thesma for you and you know I was I was

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:27.058
you know I knew that he probably would and um but I knew this last final key that I

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:33.840
asked him for a name that he was able to look into the text and pull out and

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.880
suddenly make sense of how that hymn is working he

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.820
understands now he's got he possesses the magic name so that gives him

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:49.860
um a a vision right that gives him an understanding or

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:55.440
a reality I had a choice of the goal with the the IV diadem or the L'Oreal

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:01.380
but I want him to lower out because of the phasma fora is the light so Apollo

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:08.039
is the is the L'Oreal I went with that's why I went with the with the that's I picked this for that reason

00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:13.320
and the lore out as a feminine in the uh Ivy is male

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:19.080
that was correct me if I'm wrong but we're talking when we're standing there with

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:26.220
Heracles and we know the family of dawnbringer um we know that he is both male and

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:32.940
female right yes yeah what did you you talked about dreams and

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:38.880
Visions now could you tell us something please about because after the after the

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:46.200
initiation you know you sit with a priest in Antiquity and the dude writes on a scroll what you what you've been

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:54.120
saying right and then they use that they read off of that they're really using you as guinea pig right right but their

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.400
read off of that it's a it's a real Quantum act so could you tell us about

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.440
your visions yeah he's he's also Diana the luciferia

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:09.480
the torch bringer my last

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:15.600
Ayahuasca trip I'm not gonna say when it was it might have been yesterday it might have been today I'm not going to tell you it might

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.120
have been a year ago I'll just tell you what it was NYX was in the sky

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:26.940
she was crying she was pointing to a bright star in the sky

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:36.120
and I just I'll never forget it it was very Vivid it was very real and Ayahuasca is the uh it's that it's

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:42.059
that kaikion it is it really is I there's no doubt in my mind that the kai Keon has had DMT and it just like cut

00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:48.840
just like Ayahuasca does it brings you into the Mania and it shows you something it's real quick too but it's

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:55.140
all it's all it takes we were uh let's bring it up to the

00:19:55.140 --> 00:20:02.700
let's bring it up to the church library and say um here in the initiation we're

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:11.100
concerned with the one most potent elements of the communion is the historical power of the song So

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:17.340
Neil is you know they're going to come bust down the door in a minute Neil and drag you away to the Inquisition and

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:22.580
when they do I'm gonna swear I'm gonna swear that you are a Satanist like

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:28.799
full-fledged right full-fledged but um before they before they get here and do

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:37.500
that um Neil is talking about a magic that right now in society is extremely uh uh

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:43.559
forbidden and not just for legal not just for legal sake or for clinical uh

00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:49.380
Health's sake um but also for religious sake because

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:55.679
the communion is that transfer now Neil is working on his own end on that right

00:20:55.679 --> 00:21:02.220
I'm here to provide the images I'm the Mystic GOG right I'm providing you with

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:08.400
the images that's all right and as I was telling Neil that I was like dude you got to do this you guys should have been

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:15.059
there that he was so mad he was so mad and he was like God damn it oh I'm sorry I shouldn't say it online he was saying

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:22.039
you know what what do you do and what are you doing you lied to me this can't be the case this can't be the case

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:29.220
every word Greek one by one and I was looking up the the definitions in the

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:34.440
with these Perseus Tufts we call it Alice so I was asking Alice what's this

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.539
word mean when it's been what's the context of when has it been used I don't know how many words are in that

00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:45.539
hymn 100 maybe 200 somewhere in between and I went through every single one didn't find what he was looking when he

00:21:45.539 --> 00:21:51.659
what he told me to find and I go are you see are you serious and that the one word that I found uh what

00:21:51.659 --> 00:21:58.260
was it that's in my Texas to you it was it was the one that had Aphrodite's girdle and I thought you were messing with me

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:03.559
because I thought I found it and I thought you weren't telling me let's see which one where was that do you remember

00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:10.320
and I told him and I told him uh a dozen times I told him it does it's

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.600
difficult when you're in this when you're in this window with um of

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:21.059
opportunity it's difficult to to pull out the images and the focus and to

00:22:21.059 --> 00:22:27.480
really so I kept reinforcing was Neil Ponta Creator was one of them because that's all powerful I'm like is it that

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:35.100
one you're like no yeah lying to me and then I found the one that was uh where is it the one about Aphrodite's girdle

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:41.100
and I said this has got to be it I said there's no way someone would not make me find this word this is too this is too

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:47.400
good because I was looking at the what Alice said about that word and there was a ton of initiation cult stuff going on

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:53.520
with that word so I was I was like there's no way this isn't the word and I started getting pissed I was like you're

00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:00.720
lying I know and that's why then you like go through it again went through the whole hymn again word by word by word by word and then I found

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:06.780
it I said his head of Hercules and I'm looking at the English and it said something about Hercules head brings out

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:13.620
the light I was like Lucifer so then I found then I went back to the Greek where that passage was and

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:21.240
I found the word it stuck out it just also I saw that for us that's my Forest boom and I texted you with the BAM uh

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.520
Emoji you know bam that little like Star thing found it and you were like good work

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:33.480
you're like you let's do the show tonight I was like yeah yeah now you know the place I love this kind of this

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:40.320
is this helps me learn Greek though all seriousness doing this doing this

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:47.640
one I'm looking up Greek words I'm trying to pronounce them I'm looking up with the meaning I learned like 20 new

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:55.260
Greek words today from doing this so this was a very educational process for me too this wasn't just you know

00:23:55.260 --> 00:24:02.820
this was there's another side of this too is useful absolutely yeah now Neil I wanted to ask

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:09.120
you again you had some dreams and you you're looking at night as and she is

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.880
the mother she's the mother of Dreams and I'm just wondering what then images

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.640
are you processing of night as you're doing as you're going through this process

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:26.940
I'm having I haven't I've been having a reoccurring dream a lot lately and this

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:32.940
reoccurring dream and it happens in different ways but it always ends up the ground opening up and going down in some

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:39.299
some like underworld place whether it be like the one the one the one time I had this dream I was at a

00:24:39.299 --> 00:24:45.720
park there were people playing music it was like a party or something and I was on it I walked up a slide like

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:51.179
a little kid would to go down the slide awesome the ground opens up again I'm like oh his dreams happening again I

00:24:51.179 --> 00:24:58.980
keep having this recurring the ground sinkhole opening up and everyone falling down inside of it so that's one of the

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:04.860
things and I also wanted to ask you this too what are the odds that when you and I a

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:10.140
couple months ago or a month or two ago when we were looking for a secret word

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:15.419
that had to fit a certain Gematria what are the odds that that had to turn out

00:25:15.419 --> 00:25:21.780
to be pseudo Knicks the image of Knicks and we're and this is all playing out like this it's interesting getting what

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:27.260
you think I never thought about that until today yeah yeah yeah

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:32.520
I'm right Neil and that's why I mentioned hermotimus

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.980
because he is that one like Jung was doing in that video

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:45.179
um he's the one who is able to make that connection right he's the um you've been to the you

00:25:45.179 --> 00:25:51.480
you you understand going into the deep night in order to reach the dawn because

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:59.880
we are dawnbringers right we and you understand the connection with lucifera

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:06.179
right lucifera you you understand that connection so as you're feeling this and

00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:12.000
as you're going as you're me I hate to say meditating because it's just like it's not it's just you're focusing right

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.179
you just you're just setting your mind on something um as you're going through describe it

00:26:18.179 --> 00:26:23.900
as a Mania all right so yeah talk about talk about tell me about the man

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:29.039
it's the Mania going through the hymns reading the words

00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:36.059
focusing on them looking at the images looking at the statues of the ancient Greeks made the ones that are they found

00:26:36.059 --> 00:26:41.159
in Athens the ones they found in Pompeii looking at these images and

00:26:41.159 --> 00:26:48.419
trying to connect with the words and the Greek and trying to speak them out loud this is the Mania it's the it's the

00:26:48.419 --> 00:26:54.480
energy that comes from it I know Sobek can identify with me right now because we talk about this there's something and

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:59.760
Ariel or even price net probably a lot of people I don't know who knows how many people look good you know what I'm

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:05.880
talking about something about this search for the in the ancient world just searching for these texts that's

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:11.340
powerful and something that there's there's a there's a magic from it

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:16.640
probably the same thing that a lot of people who go into

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:23.340
religious fundamentalism get at but they falsely accredited to something that's

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:30.240
not does that make sense yeah and does it do the does the context

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:37.799
as you're going through this process and you're working the initiation the same avenues that they were working the same

00:27:37.799 --> 00:27:44.039
images do you find that it's um that it kind of fills you in on context like

00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:51.240
right now you go back and you'll find something when Jesus is like I am the way you'll know that he's talking about

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:57.260
the abstract thing the way or with the Mystic the

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:02.760
initiation the initiation is the initiator there's

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:09.120
initiation is the initiator I am the way there's one passage that nobody can

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:15.299
agree on it's the most mysterious passage he says if thine eye be single

00:28:15.299 --> 00:28:20.460
the whole body is filled with lights and everybody all the scholars and all the

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.559
different Christian denominations the Orthodox the Catholics the pro there are they all have their own way of

00:28:25.559 --> 00:28:31.919
interpreting what this how this means people think it's the third eye thing but what is he saying if thine I'd be

00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:37.500
single the whole body is filled with light I think he's talking about apotheosis

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.659
when he wants to say that he is one with God he says that you could do the same thing he's not saying that only he could

00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:47.760
do it and then just believe in him or he's saying I'm doing it you can do it

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:54.000
anyone can do it he's going for the apotheosis the attainment of the gnosis

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.279
that Paul talks about the mystery of the knowledge which is exactly what I would

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:04.980
expect to hear from somebody who had been initiated into the mysteries of

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:12.840
Heracles that's exactly how I would expect them to talk so do you do you see do you feel what I

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:18.419
thought about today when you showed me that word I thought I said that's my photos my head bringing the lights I go

00:29:18.419 --> 00:29:24.179
that sounds like sounds like that verse from the eye being single your I being a

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:31.919
one one eye bringing light that's what that means that's a luciferian that's a luciferian passage

00:29:31.919 --> 00:29:40.860
all day long correct correct and that eye or that Ops that gaze that that look

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:48.539
um is supposed to be um gold when you when it comes to the medwa

00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:54.539
right The Courier herself the one who is the Healer

00:29:54.539 --> 00:30:00.659
right the one who is that sorceress whether it's kuria nukta or the Kora

00:30:00.659 --> 00:30:08.039
that Courier is the central figure of the hit of all the hymns of the orphic

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:13.200
right over and over for a reason right there's a reason she comes at eluses

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.720
there's a reason that she comes as Isis right we know that we know that there's

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:24.659
a so um how did you feel when you're in the middle of this and you're looking at you

00:30:24.659 --> 00:30:29.700
know you want to be like Heracles right you want to you want to succeed nobody

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:35.100
goes into the initiation want to be told uh okay you know come back in a month

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:43.140
right um and I Pro for everybody who's watching this I gave Neil no hints he

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:48.960
asked me repeatedly and I told him no you have to pull it out and he pulled

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:55.080
that yes for us that Dawn bringer literally it's in the middle of the hymn

00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:01.440
in a mirror formation so that you can write because we use mirror magic if

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:08.039
since we have ears to hear Neil has ears to hear he knows what that means now he knows how to go back to the text and see

00:31:08.039 --> 00:31:13.740
oh photos sales right oh wait a minute right there it is right in the middle

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:20.480
staring you in the face they're saying these and I'm sure Neil it's got to be back me up on this what do you think

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:28.980
they said the song the song of the medwa is more powerful than the drugs that are

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:36.419
involved that's what you give me your reflection on that yeah because the song is what gets you

00:31:36.419 --> 00:31:42.659
into the and it gets you into that like like the pythagoreans knew what they were doing when they were putting

00:31:42.659 --> 00:31:49.260
together the H string chords and they knew what they were doing they're fine-tuning the sounds and making sure

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:55.140
that that that song puts that person into that trance into that mode to get

00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:00.240
in that energy the Mania to get into that revelry so it's more important it's

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:06.779
more important to be there than to take the drug taking the drug by itself doesn't do is only half the book that's

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:14.279
nothing the song is where it's at the melody the the the tune the hymns the

00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:20.820
the frequency that that's the word the frequency so ask any Christian who goes to church

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:26.340
that their favorite part is the part where their parts start singing and dancing that's the part where they feel the spirit

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:31.679
that's orphic so the physics they're relying on the

00:32:31.679 --> 00:32:36.840
physics are there you know set within the images that their religion is

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:42.360
pushing so isn't it funny do you get the feeling now that this whole last 2 000

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:49.320
year build up of accreted garbage um has given us this Faith thing we go

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:55.320
to church we have the faith and we do this or we go through a certain number of steps and then we have the faith do

00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:01.500
you see how that is not the operation of the mystery the operation of the mystery

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:08.640
is the bringing of the individual it's like taking a really good mom-and-pop owned restaurant and then corporatizing

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:15.299
it and and making it for that for like every city to have every city has a buffalo wings now but the original

00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:21.600
buffalo wings from the beginning days was the real authentic version and it

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:29.279
worked it was a miracle but all these other fake copycats it's all just cooker Cutty stuff yeah you get the little a

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:36.360
little bit of a little bit of a jolt from it but it's not the real thing it's just a copy it's just uh it's like a

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:42.360
ghost of our body it's not the real thing it's a phantom you can touch your you can put your

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:50.120
finger right through it it's not real you can't grab it but this the real Mysteries the real orphic

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:56.279
alisonian Delphi Mysteries are the real deal that's where all this is coming

00:33:56.279 --> 00:34:02.279
from the the Eucharist drinking the blood and eating the body the brain and

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:07.620
the blood the grape and the vine and the uh grain diameter and Bacchus putting

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:13.980
them into your body becoming Bacchus by eating Bacchus by eating the grapes and drinking The Vine by eating the grain

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:22.980
the uh the uh the uh the old uh ergot grain that has been fermented taking in

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:28.919
those gods and becoming the gods becoming born dying and reborn rebirth

00:34:28.919 --> 00:34:34.560
all those Concepts that you see with these religions that don't understand where they come from or why they're even

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:42.240
doing it that's why they're doing it because they took a process that's been working that has real magic Mania and

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:47.280
they're trying to multiply it times a million and it loses

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:53.520
it's like it's like taking the that first source of light this is with agnostics in fact this is a sethian text

00:34:53.520 --> 00:35:00.180
that says in the beginning the Creator was a source of light and then he be got two more lights those two lights had a

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:06.480
little bit more dim and then those two lights we got more lights and those lights were a little bit more dim than that and then after billions and

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:11.760
billions of trillions years you have these dim lights flying around creating stuff and that's what that's what yaldub

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:17.400
Yahweh was he was one of those dim lights who thought he was the thought he was the big light but he wasn't there

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:23.339
really is bet there's there's brighter lights than that that's what the sethians talk about so

00:35:23.339 --> 00:35:29.460
do you think that do you think that impulse toward the Open Eyes

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:35.040
um do you think that desire to like take a breath because you know as you're going into it you're saying okay I'm

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:40.740
gonna work myself up in this initiation how do I do it and I got to do diet and I got to do

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:47.160
um you know I gotta I gotta regular and again I think this one is important um for entering that death State I think

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:52.940
it's important for you to be really close that way um and to do the you know yeah

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.960
with a full stomach you're puking it up yeah you need to leave 24 hours at least

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:04.200
with no food if you're gonna eat anything I think this is interesting if you're going to eat anything they say eat some grapes now I think that's

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:09.720
interesting because what is it what is what is grapes it's Bacchus the Vine

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:16.920
the one thing that you can pop you can put in your stomach that's not gonna affect the Mania happens to be Bacchus

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.960
the bakoy the Vine I I actually I wanted to ask you about

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:27.180
that what do you think about that uh I was concentrating on

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:32.400
um I'm getting on that necromancy I'm always nil I'm always gonna air to the

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:40.260
side of the necromancy and I think when you put when you starve yourself you go ketotic you enter into that state of of

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:47.220
contempt for the living and that's what I was pushing now and you know hey if I

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:53.940

emanating around the head of this

00:39:16.619 --> 00:39:22.200
um Heracles and we thought Heracles was somebody else right you thought he was

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:27.359
myth fairytale blah blah right no I'm talking with within the cult now Neil

00:39:27.359 --> 00:39:33.240

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:47.940
yeah you're boloist with his now remember we saw that you know it was able to point that out guys I did not

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:54.000
know that before today now I can now I'm telling you that what you did for me today I'm able to pull

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.460
I'm able to look at some of these words and point them out without even having the English right next to me

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:05.579
okay go ahead let me call you off go ahead no that's okay the eoboloi right those are the shutters of the poison we

00:40:05.579 --> 00:40:10.619
saw those in Nero's him Nero got for the sacred formula right

00:40:10.619 --> 00:40:18.480
the poison shutters um uh yeah and so Neil tell me though

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:23.700
um as you're working these hymns over and you're going through this and you're TR you're you're attempting to break

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:29.820
through that barrier and you do you reach something you you

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:37.500
got that name you pulled it out I told you calm down you calm down you cast out that demon

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:42.540
who was calling me an SOB or whatever it was it wasn't that you know what I mean

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:48.780
yeah but right right and we got rid of him as soon as we can cast out that

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:54.660
demon then you suddenly have access you calmed and the very next text you sent

00:40:54.660 --> 00:41:03.119
me was the exact name that I was looking for from the hymn uh what's the magic of

00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:11.700
that tell me finding tough to find that that that that uh

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:19.440
sacred name that sacred title so we know what really what Hercules is this so it's the ears to hear for the

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:25.980
people on the outside they hear about Hercules and his 12 he had his 12 Labors and he was very strong and he he went to

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:31.500
yeah you know he won every fight he was in yeah that's great cool but the inner

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:40.920
Mysteries the deeper darker mysteries for those who have ears to hear is that Hercules is the male Lucifer but also is

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:48.800
also who's also the female Diana very good and you can feel comfortable

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:57.780
in that you can feel comfortable perfectly comfortable Satan's saturnian by gender doesn't

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:05.520
bother you it doesn't bother you the devil has a sister Lucifer and lucifera and they happen to be a diet that

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:10.859
they're not bother me I I like that that that's something to be proud about

00:42:10.859 --> 00:42:17.820
that's something that's amazing right yeah isn't isn't it remarkable that that

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:23.280
it aren't haven't we switched Neil haven't we switched our polls where is

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.619
it right here haven't we switched our polls now you suddenly have yeah you you

00:42:28.619 --> 00:42:36.180
suddenly have found out you suddenly found out that the bad guy is the good guy and the good guy is a creep

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:42.780
and so now you understand why the whole entering into the morning you were sending me then you I saw when you

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:48.660
understood it and you were like oh the morning it's morning exactly that's why I turn the lights off that's why it's

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:54.780
darker here yeah nice nice I'm surrounded by Nick's right now

00:42:54.780 --> 00:43:00.720
do you what did you write on your I told you I told you before we went live I'm not having any lights on oh the only

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:06.660
light on me is my computer screen and then I have the red lights behind me that's it all the lights are off that's

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:13.700
it could you show us your head because I know you wrote some things on your head could you show us your head

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:22.579
oh yes look at that that that is the son of Heracles right

00:43:22.579 --> 00:43:29.099
yeah let me see okay all right I couldn't really see

00:43:29.099 --> 00:43:35.400
what I was doing in the mirror so if it doesn't look right but okay can you read it at least you understand you

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:42.000
understand I can't read that one you understand is that is that NYX or something though yeah I can't read next

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.339
who yeah yeah it's probably because the camera's reversing it yeah I can tell

00:43:47.339 --> 00:43:54.000
this is n y x and then then here's the Greek oh I see oh I see yeah no it's

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.940
backwards yeah look you wrote it as if it were the reflection that's fantastic

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:04.280
you wrote it didn't realize that holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:11.400
mirror magic bro now wait a minute Everybody is watching why why what is he

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:18.300
doing he's putting the names of his God on his head and if you remember not only

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.940
do the bad guys do this but the good guys do this too the early Christians

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:30.900
are talking about being branded with the name of God so you know Neil

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:38.838
physics here what does it do when you put that name of that God on your head it's freedom

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:48.480
it's that freedom to be to be one with the power with the Demonic power the

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:56.280
demiurgic power over creation the keys to Victory that's what that feeling is

00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:01.619
nothing like it nothing yeah you've been sitting you can sit on

00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:07.980
that throne and you can feel that Kingdom power definitely love it being

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:15.000
anointed by Knicks yeah nice nice now last question that I have and I'm not

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.480
going uh I can't make it to the to the and I know people are going to want you to stay so I'm not rushing because I

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:26.579
want you to answer a couple two if I can get two more questions I'll be happy

00:45:26.579 --> 00:45:32.040
um but I can't go to the after meeting tonight but I want to I'm going to be

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:37.800
getting in touch with those people and I'm going to be doing short segments of your testimonies breaking out of

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:45.780
Jehovah's Witnesses I can't wait for that one that one's going to be fantastic yeah well no this would just be one

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:51.720
testimonial see it's one thing to just be a regular dude who wants to join this

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:58.560
and get something from it and that's fine but it's another it's a whole nother thing to leave

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:05.339
to leave the false religion for the real religion that's something whoever that

00:46:05.339 --> 00:46:10.980
is I don't know who it is yet he's not he's not telling people people see this is all private I have no idea who it is

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:17.280
but whoever it is I already know you're in that Mania right now you're feeling it you're leaving the church you're

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:25.859
leaving that shackles behind you and you're starting a new thing nothing wrong with that awesome I support it I I

00:46:25.859 --> 00:46:33.420
felt so I I don't know I'm sure you felt this way before and I'm maybe I'm just feeling it for the first time but I feel

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:39.839
such an attachment to what people were saying because people were coming forward in the Discord and saying yeah I

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:44.880
was this and I was there for so long and it was like well what broke you out what

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:51.060
got you out of your prison and it's the it's over and over and over again Neil

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:57.420
it it looks like the audience has this consistently built into it is this just

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:04.440
because we're is this how the world is that we've all been put into these Cults and now we you know it's time we don't

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:09.780
have the options that's what I'm saying my my mission in life before I die is at

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:15.060
least start one I want to have a hundred around the country but at least start

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:22.140
one Temple tobaccus somewhere start and then once that one gets put up

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:28.079
someone else will see it and say we're going to start one in my city and next thing you know there might be a city

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:33.660
that has more temples of Bacchus than there is for Catholic churches Catholic churches we might even take an old

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:39.960
Catholic Church that turn that that fell apart and rebuild it as a temple of Bacchus one day that's what we need to

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:46.020
start thinking about that's ahead of the times man you're you're I think you're ahead of the times

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:51.839
with that imagine if imagine if people were like you and had as much guts as

00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:58.260
you do and that same vision and you know started building temples

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:03.420
started going back to the Pagan practices that built things like

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:09.599
democracy that's all we had to do we had to say what the what was the algorithm that allowed you to do democracy you

00:48:09.599 --> 00:48:15.180
know and how how do we worship that you know Mary Mary beard they worship female

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:20.220
Gods Mary there's a reason let me let me ask you that Neil you're talking about

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:25.440
night black knight Dark Knight who is a

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:33.960
female um how does it make you feel to worship a female absolutely perfectly fine great

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:39.540
makes sense it it it's it it makes sense like that I

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:47.040
don't know how to say it just makes sense that way because it worked we were born from a woman where that's where the pot that's the

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:53.579
and that's Sophia the Ancients weren't stupid when they assigned Sophia to be female they

00:48:53.579 --> 00:48:59.579
weren't just making they were they knew what they were talking about that was that that Divine wisdom comes from the

00:48:59.579 --> 00:49:07.440
comes from the goddess you see that this man did more with

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:15.900
um the songs of the ancient priestesses than he did with all of your modern scholarship and all of your feminism he

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:22.020
just was able to break through you know to that place that uh that special

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:27.599
worship of the of the great mother it uh I don't

00:49:27.599 --> 00:49:33.839
it almost feels like your life as a man is incomplete

00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:39.660
um if you don't have that you you sent to me one of the little clips that you sent to me you said oh wait a minute um

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:45.480
it's the child nourisher right you were recognizing you were recognizing those

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:50.819
attributes right those symbols were coming out to you they were healing it's

00:49:50.819 --> 00:49:56.700
a healing presence don't you think when you cast out those demons it's a healing prayer I think what do you think

00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:03.000
I agree 100 couldn't have said it better myself yeah it's that it's that's okay so you

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.400
have the great mother and then you have Saturn the father but

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:15.060
you have to enter into that divine child rebirth death and come out as the Divine

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:21.420
Child and you need to reach that apotheosis and become one with the mother and the

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:28.140
father and then yourself right now does it bother you that Jesus or do you understand when Jesus is

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:33.440
saying look look you've got to re-enter the womb a second time

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:38.460
he's the most misunderstood person in the world history he would have been one of us he wouldn't have been he would

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:44.099
have he would if you you could bring if you actually could resurrect him brought him back he would he would not like

00:50:44.099 --> 00:50:49.680
where his movement turned into that's my final I'll never be convinced otherwise

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:56.400
that if he came back he would be just disappointed in what his name ended up

00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:02.700
as and he'd be looking for people like you and me saying that's what I was talking about that's what I meant by

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:08.880
being God by calling yourself God that's what I meant you can do it too

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:17.400
that's what he would say do you think now that you have been through um the gallery that is the the Herculean

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:24.780
initiation and you understand the core Dark Knight do you think you could

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:30.839
um uh help explain

00:51:30.839 --> 00:51:38.960
help explain why the Christians would be so fearful

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:44.339
of this cup of pornea giving

00:51:44.339 --> 00:51:51.540
um goddess um why you know it's in all the apocalyptic ah right it's all there and

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:57.660
it's all a big important part of it so what in your experiences now you you're looking back and you've gone through

00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:04.859
this and you've been through it and you may continue you may make yourself do it again you know did you notice ambulance

00:52:04.859 --> 00:52:11.460
is like there's a whole bunch of different times that he's that he's initiated right yeah um

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:17.880
um Augustus the the emperor of the western world he had initiated like five

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:23.160
times they said twice into eluses itself you didn't have to go there twice but he

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:29.099
did he went to Delphi he went to he went to all these different Mysteries and got initiated and you know he wanted to be

00:52:29.099 --> 00:52:35.700
that August one he wanted to be like there's that's there's something about that yeah for sure and and another thing

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:42.180
I was just talking earlier I was recording with uh Dr Andrew um Henry Schuyler we're talking about

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:47.760
early Christianity and uh it's this is the I know I know you're gonna identify

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:52.800
with me I know you're gonna know what I'm saying right now and you're going to be because the default position

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:59.339
by Scholars when they talk about the the O fights in the nazims the serpent Christians the ones that had the agathas

00:52:59.339 --> 00:53:04.980
Daemon the good Daemon this was a charm a magic charm that they would put in their house for good luck it was a

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:10.500
serpent anyways the hippolytus irenaeus Justin Martyr

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:15.780
all these guys that are writing about these heretic Christians and saying that

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:22.140
they're all you know uh drinking porneia and having orgies climate of Alexandria's writing about this and the

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:28.140
scholars today the default position is that they're probably just making this

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:33.420
out to make fun of them which could be true but I've heard a few people and I know you

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:39.000
say this too this why why we know the bakic revelaries are real we know these

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:46.559
rights are going on all over the Greek world so why can't the Christians do it right it doesn't it doesn't seem

00:53:46.559 --> 00:53:52.319
it doesn't seem to fit when you know okay look when you what is better than

00:53:52.319 --> 00:53:57.780
these gods of antiquity then the god Dawn right she who would you want to

00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:03.119
embrace more than Don when we perform the mystery we know that that time is

00:54:03.119 --> 00:54:08.940
our time and that we rise to her right and that does something to us guess what

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:15.119
the Christians were doing exactly the same thing haven't you ever wondered why

00:54:15.119 --> 00:54:21.180
it says they all get up early and they all went out it wasn't because Christianity went pop onto the scene

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:26.280
which is I swear with the academics support right they know that's not the

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:31.500
case but it's what they support um and yeah and you're exactly right and

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:37.920
in undercutting the O fights and saying oh it's the you know they're just making this stuff up to make their enemies look

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:44.339
bad no no they're doing exactly what the pagans are doing this is a pagan mystery that's what I'm saying at the O fights

00:54:44.339 --> 00:54:50.099
we're around to defend themselves they would say no no that's true we were we were getting down with the Mysteries the

00:54:50.099 --> 00:54:55.740
not seen preacher I mean come on what does the Nasim preacher say he says I

00:54:55.740 --> 00:55:03.180
call the Atticus the Assyrians call you at this though Egyptians call you Dionysus I'm sorry I gotta fix this but

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:08.819
it's okay I can hear my voice anyway uh the the Thracians call you adamus all

00:55:08.819 --> 00:55:15.180
these different names and he says you know the player of the pipes Pan the player of the flute

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:20.640
Orpheus he's naming all these names off from the Mysteries and he's identifying

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:26.760
the Christ as that so there's no doubt in my mind that the not seen preacher

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:33.359
was doing this type of syncretism there's no doubt in my mind he's part and they're and they're all under the Mysteries they're all into the Mysteries

00:55:33.359 --> 00:55:39.900
so there's you can't tell me that they weren't engaging in the same things that were people in a Lucius were engaging in

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:47.579
and getting that that Mania going that was the way to do it that was the origiastic rites of Orpheus the orphic

00:55:47.579 --> 00:55:55.200
theology is what gives us Christianity to begin with right exactly exactly okay everybody

00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:02.099
heard that not not from me from Neil and I'm 100 100 because he's talking about

00:56:02.099 --> 00:56:07.680
the evidence now he's just talking about who they were these people what were they doing right he's got nothing to

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:13.140
grind he's got no position to keep he doesn't have anybody to impress and look

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:19.020
good he's just holding up the evidence um Neil I'm gonna since oh do we get you

00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:27.720
back yeah um I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and cut off but I thought I would I would uh let you end it let you end it

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:32.940
with something that uh you wanted to say about

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:41.359
um about the value about the value of getting those images

00:56:41.359 --> 00:56:48.119
right of of digging in um uh just just tell me you're going to

00:56:48.119 --> 00:56:54.839
report back to the dojo next week for Greek and when I give you Greek assignments and I'm yelling at you to

00:56:54.839 --> 00:57:02.640
get them done you'll understand I'm doing it now to get you to have those eyes you've begun to see those texts now

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:09.780
what do you anticipate from this point out you now you realize you can do everything now right if you if you

00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:15.839
perfect this art and this skill now you can act is that intermediary right you

00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:21.300
don't need me and that's why that's why I enjoy doing this is because it's me teaching you a skill I'm not taking you

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:26.819
tuition right I thought it's the perfect thing to say to people it doesn't even have to be Greek even

00:57:26.819 --> 00:57:34.140
though that's where I would go because I think the Greeks have the I think they were the brilli I think they were the Brilliant Minds of our world but learn

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:40.500
Sanskrit learn Coptic learned Latin and then go back and re-translate some of

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:45.599
these texts for yourself and that is where that's where the magic happens

00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:52.079
when you do the work when you teach when you get that nose this is what gnosis is it's not about just believing what the

00:57:52.079 --> 00:57:58.140
text says and just believing that you're some guy translated it for you correctly and you're just gonna watch a YouTube

00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:03.720
video go in and do get the gnosis get that Divine knowledge if you learn the

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:10.020
languages go back translate it for yourself and I'm I'm doing John John

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:16.200
look at that John and I'm finding out right in the beginning of John not only is there the Lagos which is a concept

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:22.440
that means nothing way more than just the word that's not what it means but not but not even just that that's that's

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:28.140
kindergarten stuff the next passage that verse 3 talks about uh talks about the

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:34.260
uh the life of Zoe did you know that Zoe is in John no I just found that out from

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:42.240
going to the Greek you wouldn't know that from the English but Zoe is in there so the logos is Zoe so I'm I'm I

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:49.859
even had to ask lit wasn't is the logos a female he said some people do think that he said that's good translation

00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:57.240
no that's not in the English but I found that I found that from my own translation that the Lagos is life Zoe

00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:02.960
and Zoe's a female word because it ends with that that hater

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:08.220
excellent you you heard it from the Gnostic informant

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:14.040
get off your sofa and move over a cushion and get a program that'll help

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:19.920
