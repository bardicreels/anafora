00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:41.440
bit I'm the I see a lot of people on YouTube doing lots and lots of

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:49.800
shows giving lots of interviews and I see a lot of ideas and

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:55.320
I don't see anybody actually doing the

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.480
Greek huh I see a lot of people professing to but I don't see a lot of

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:07.000
people doing it so the next time somebody says where's this evidence it's right here bring it up to it's right

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.320
here people look here it is okay let's read this let's just read it in the

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.399
Greek he says I'm gonna do a sign he says I know that you're a pharmacos and

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:24.639
a student of Jesus he says you're not gonna you're not gonna bamboozle me you're not going to

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:30.800
bamboozle me cuz what's what's Philip been doing he's been bamboozling people

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:37.519
this guy is nuts this guy is nuts he makes people blind and then heals them

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:43.279
leave it up he makes people blind and and then heals them so that they will

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:49.040
follow him and give him their children you're kidding oh by the end of

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:56.680
this you guys are GNA be so fed up you're gonna be so fed up with this circus oh God makes your stomach turn

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:02.320
what these Christians are doing and all under the direct leadership and guidance

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:09.639
of Jesus himself now Phillip fortunately is able to conjure

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:15.120
Jesus he's able to say Shazam and then all of a sudden

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:21.399
now there he is it's really cool you should see it and lots of drugs any

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:27.160
anyhow anywh who see how they're calling him a drug a drug guy watch what he does

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.760
he says you're not going to this other guy tells Philip he says you're not going to bamboozle me you're not going

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:41.800
to mess with my mind and so what does it say The Apostle says to him

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:49.040
ZB brah tah that's his summoning he just

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:55.680
summoned Jesus tahu come quickly and then he gave him some of the words that

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:02.519
we see in the Greek magical papyrus fantastic isn't that nice and look they

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:08.920
say these things forwards and backwards they take um syllables and reverse them

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:14.120
oh it's good stuff and if you're able to follow it you can tell which gods are

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.760
being imprecate so here Philip is he says his magic words up come up comes

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:28.920
Jesus and let's go back to text up comes Jesus yeah and um next oh oh oh and so

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:36.120
and so Phillip is like Phillip is like okay here we go and he does this thing

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.760
and you know he's like got a shout that's magic if you want to think of it

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:48.600
that way and he shouts this thing out this magic shout in the ground underneath this guy who says you're not

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:55.839
gonna bamboozle me it opens up and then swallows him up to his knees up to his knees and he says now do

00:13:55.839 --> 00:14:03.279
you want to be a Christian the guy's like no so the ground opens up again only this

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:10.920
time up to his neck and he says now do you want to be a Christian long story short you know

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:16.720
sometimes it's hard to convince somebody to be a Christian sometimes you gotta

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.759
you know bury them up to their neck torture them a little bit right that

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:28.279

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:31.160
antidote when when you ask yourself why Jesus is with a naked boy in a public

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:38.440
park uh at 4:00 a.m. when he gets arrested yelling I'm not a child trafficker you have to realize that that

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:46.680
child was a lot more than just an innocent victim that child was a

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:57.040
transformed Factory for drug rights yes yes okay okay now Jesus and

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:02.839
the naked boys um we're going to continue this theme with Neil now um who

00:40:02.839 --> 00:40:09.280
is going to talk to you about the gospel of of philli oh and the dragon thing

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:15.480
we'll have to wait on the the great um summoning of the dragon and the rights we'll get to that but now I want to

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:20.640
bring Neil I just got a couple texts that I'm gonna throw in I'll give it right back to you and you can finish off

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:27.280
with that Dragon um and a couple of them are related this is from the gospel of Peter Coptic Tex

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:32.839
attributed to Peter same guy different language this one this first one's

00:40:32.839 --> 00:40:39.400
called God is a Maneater and so this is the gospel of Peter is not really a gospel in like

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:45.839
like you're like you're used to it's a it's wisdom literature so it has little paragraphs with different titles and

00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:52.480
it's just all over the place back and forth there is no like doesn't start in the beginning in the beginning Mary gave

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:59.920
birth nope it just goes all over the place wisdom literature sort of like a proverb well yeah Proverbs anyways God

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:06.280
is a Maneater so people are sacrificed to him whoa this is the Christian [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:14.720
right here this is the real Christian [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] listen to this before humans were sacrificed it was animals because those

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:21.400
they were eaten by were not Gods wait a minute are you telling me that your God

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:29.280
just wants to be sacrificed humans and not animals what what this is

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:37.400
like before I go to the next one thoughts on this one real quick what do you think about this yeah the consumer you know what

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:44.280
I've seen a band of women eat eat a person take him apart and eat him so

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:50.560
yeah no this is uh I would smell in line with that bakic tradition isn't it yeah exactly no it's part it's why the Greeks

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:57.079
are always walking around embarrassed about their past saying well we don't sacrifice human beings anymore anym

00:41:57.079 --> 00:42:02.359
right yeah and then and the Jews said the same thing about um sacrificing their like if you look at the Old

00:42:02.359 --> 00:42:07.560
Testament text it says like oh they outlawed Human Sacrifice because of

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:13.880
Abraham like they basically let you know like before Abraham this was all this was all over the place which is you know

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:19.680
whatever and there's there's text from like poery about uh people in Canan

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:26.359
sacrificing humans to Saturn and there's a lot of texts like that actually anyways I thought that was interesting

00:42:26.359 --> 00:42:32.240
oh there's there's another Christian group that butt heads with this group The Val I think it's the uh the Seth

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:37.960
sethians they didn't get along well because the canites were pure

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:43.960
vegetarians so they thought that Yahweh this is these canites were badasses they

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:51.319
were completely completely Against the Grain they thought Yahweh this God that wants

00:42:51.319 --> 00:42:59.440
Human Sacrifice evil and they said Jesus is the son of a different god um Sophia

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:05.559
wisdom and they said that Yahweh is evil because of this and so they have diff

00:43:05.559 --> 00:43:12.800
they have different opinions on Cain was the good guy Abel was the bad guy such stuff like that anyways I'm gonna keep

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:18.359
going next one mystery is called this one says I'm gonna read it from my text

00:43:18.359 --> 00:43:25.720
so I can't see the bottom this is this is called mystery same Gospel of philli Coptic text translated into English it

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:31.040
is good to speak of mystery especially because the father of all joined with

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:36.800
the Virgin who came down and on that day a fire Shone over him he came to the

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:42.720
bridal chamber so so on that very day his body came into being and on the day

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:47.880
he left the chamber with a splendor you know what that word is and what passed

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:54.400
between the bride and the bridegroom through this Force Jesus did

00:43:54.400 --> 00:44:00.200
everything it is good for his it is good for each of his students to go into the

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:07.599
chamber and rest get in there little boys get in the bed get in the bridal bed with Jesus you

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:13.240
know what time it is it's time for the christing any thoughts on that one I

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:18.520
think it's mainstream um uh worship of the great

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:24.000
mother with the intimacy with the boy entering the bed with you I don't think

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.440
the Christians can get away from their Heritage and um yeah I would I would say

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:37.319
you know again we're right in the middle of the mystery religion so yeah bra you might and you might be asking hey wait a

00:44:37.319 --> 00:44:45.079
minute there's no christing going on here what do you get what you just adding stuff let's go to the next let's go to the next one the superior

00:44:45.079 --> 00:44:52.480
superiority of crism to baptism the crism is superior to baptism

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:58.520
for the word crism we have been called Christians see it's not just about Jesus

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:03.800
being a Christian it's about you being christed get it and surely not from the

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:10.720
word baptism they're not Baptists that's a whole other baket cult all the way in Greece and maybe John was part of that

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:18.480
movement that's we know about the origins of the Baptists it's not Judaism the Baptists were bakins living in

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:24.079
Corinth uh Ephesus and a couple other locations and they were devotees of the

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:29.200
Goddess Kus k t y s look it up for yourself don't listen to me look it up

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:34.559
for yourself they were called Baptist these are Christians and because of the

00:45:34.559 --> 00:45:41.400
crism Christ has his name the father Anointed The Son the son Anointed The

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:47.599
Messengers see you get you get christed too and The Messengers anointed us who

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:54.280
has been anointed possesses everything Resurrection light cross holy spirit

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:59.800
that's that Daisy Demona Daisy demonia the father gave him this in the bridal

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:06.160
chamber there you go the Christ in the bridal chamber just like I just mentioned in the last passage he merely

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:16.040
accepted the gift you are the Beloved you are the disciple of the of the Adept

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:22.960
when you're an initiate in the Mysteries you do as they say you are the young boy being initiated probably around 12 years

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:28.640
old usually um myth r did this Christians did this this was the way it

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:35.880
was you are the young boy gets anointed and initiated by an elder man you become his beloved you get christed and then

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:42.079
you pass it on to the next every t as soon as you become of age and you're old enough to find your own boy to Christ

00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:48.480
that's when it happens you initiate the next that's how it started off that's what the sources tell us the father gave

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:54.200
him in his Bridal chamber he merely accepted the gift see how those L these

00:46:54.200 --> 00:47:00.800
two passages are linked together the one was about the bridal chamber and this one's about Christ thing so and he gets

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:06.800
in his bed with the Splendor what does that mean

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:12.319
naked that's what that means yeah so I got one more text that I want to show

00:47:12.319 --> 00:47:19.240
and this one I me you mentioned ejaculation this is not from the Gospel of Philip but it's also part of the same

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:24.400
group of text that came from the same area nagamati and Coptic and it says

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:32.400
Darkness a ulates mind into the womb I'm going to read the first paragraph and when the darkness saw the womb he M he

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:38.680
became unass and when he had aroused the water he rubbed the womb his mind

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:46.359
dissolved down to the depths of Nature and mingled with the power of the bitterness of darkness and the wombs eye

00:47:46.359 --> 00:47:52.599
ruptured at the wickedness in order that she might not again bring forth the Mind

00:47:52.599 --> 00:47:58.319
The Noose for it was seed of nature from the Dark

00:47:58.319 --> 00:48:05.680
Root oh one more sentence and when Nature had taken to herself the Mind by means of the dark power every likeness

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:11.160
took shape in her in her and when the darkness had acquired the likeness of

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:16.720
the mind and resembled the spirit so what I want to get your

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:24.520
thoughts on this text what do you think about this I think it's gorgeous I think it's gorgeous and I think it's a perfect

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:30.160
it's a perfect lead up to that which they pull out of that darkness when they

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:35.200
talking about that seed um why don't we talk about the seed

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:40.400
of the Dragon coming from the darkness right people don't real and people are

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:46.559
like what what are you guys talking about this is Christianity people this is the symbols that they're using and

00:48:46.559 --> 00:48:51.880
Neil assuming your translator from that Copic hit the symbols right I mean you

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:58.359
know just from you know somebody who doesn't do cic right those symbols that you're hitting are straight up mystery

00:48:58.359 --> 00:49:04.400
they're so perfectly meshed with the text that I'm about to show um Neil if

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:09.880
you can stick around I know do it I'm excited for this because I okay we have two texts that are that are attributed

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.920
to Phillip so we're thinking is this a you know they have the Joe hanine

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:21.280
collection they have the Pauline collection well we're we're today we're looking at the Philippine collection so

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:26.520
let's let's continue I like that I like that okay

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:31.880
um I'm about to sh what I'm about to show you is an actual right I'm not

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:39.599
going to comment on it for those of you who have ears to hear I want you to pay attention I want you to be focused um

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:46.119
but I'm not going to comment on it I'm just going to translate it because I think you just need this Source I don't

00:49:46.119 --> 00:49:51.640

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:32.960
behold all of a sudden a great dark wind

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:38.040
blew upon them and from the darkness

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:47.160
Came Upon the Servants of God the dragon the greatest Dragon who comes

00:55:55.119 --> 00:56:01.839
you guys they were using this right and what they would be doing with it the only thing you're doing in the mystery

00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:12.280
is you're bringing the lightning if you are the Son of God you are bathed in the lightning you are that

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:17.440
power you are born a new this is the

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:25.520
rebirth that Christianity promises and in it we have to find lightning

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:33.359
go ahead chewy hit us with that Source hit us with that Source ready this is the last paragraph and immediately there

00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:39.520
came about something that was like fire

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:46.520
lightning lightning of fire fir producing lightning that consumes and

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:53.559
let me continue translating and what happens it blinded it blinded the dragon

00:56:53.559 --> 00:57:00.480
and what else the beasts that were in the dragon wait a minute are we talking

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:06.400
about the cup are we talking about the antidote the TOA are we talking about

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:12.079
the dragon as the formula the dragon is

00:57:12.079 --> 00:57:17.280
that which contains the theia the

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:25.520
beasts in in the book of the Apocalypse they are using this exact same termin

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:31.880
ology right and their trisco are taking them there their drugs are taking them

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:38.440

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:44.280
apostles do they averted their eyes they averted their eyes and so that they

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:50.880
wouldn't be able to see into that amazing

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:58.359
place that was revealed in lightning that amazing place is the place that

00:57:58.359 --> 00:58:06.039
produces that sputum it is the place that produces that juice of the body

00:58:06.039 --> 00:58:14.480
that they call the Water of Life and it is there that one becomes blind those

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:21.520
serpents get that drug in their eyes we know that poor fiery talks about

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:28.480
the use of Venoms to create cause BL mindness and he talks about them as

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:35.799
these potent drugs so what are we going to do what are we gonna do here

00:58:35.799 --> 00:58:42.720
with with our right that we're watching if you want to follow the communion and

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:51.440
enter the lightning you must become blind a child of the serpent a child of

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:59.480
a kidna now do you know why Jesus was sitting on the cross screaming for sabak

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:06.599
Thor because that one guy in the audience that was watching him as he was hanging there dying that one guy in the

00:59:06.599 --> 00:59:12.359
audience said oh see soon as he said sabak Thon that one guy said I told you

00:59:12.359 --> 00:59:18.200
I told you the guy was a Satanist he casts out demons in the powers of the

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:23.880
underworld I told you he was this is exactly what the craft of the lace days

00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:30.039
is meant to do you are meant to Shadow within that

00:59:30.039 --> 00:59:37.799
saturnian Kingdom to perpetuate this abuse it's amazing it's

00:59:37.799 --> 00:59:44.359
amazing Neil I'm gonna let you fill in any you know questions anxieties what um

00:59:44.359 --> 00:59:50.160
what do you think I think I might have found a kid not right now can we can we pull up the screen that I

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:56.640
got ready for this this is Taylor Swift at her concert

00:59:57.310 --> 01:00:03.320
[Music]

01:00:04.359 --> 01:00:09.520
yo it hits right when she right when she screams the lightning SC and there's

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:15.480
there's like four other videos like this with Taylor Swift like yo is she the Christ is she the chosen one I'm just

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:23.039
saying just saying that is a base that is a base appeal Neil to Tay Tay right

01:00:23.039 --> 01:00:30.680
okay she got your message there okay she got she's got your message dragon that Dragon really puts

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:36.039
context in what's going on in Revelation now all of a sudden this text gives us the context what's happened in

01:00:36.039 --> 01:00:42.559
Revelation with the dragon Yeah the more cult terminology that you pick up and the more you see how the Cults are

01:00:42.559 --> 01:00:49.880
operating the more you can track it that way and it all of a sudden those things that you think are signs and wonders

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:55.119
that preachers preach about all the time and they're always coming up with the latest theory about who is the

01:00:55.119 --> 01:01:00.559
Antichrist none of that none of that stuff matters it doesn't matter at all once you see the context of what's going

01:01:00.559 --> 01:01:07.200
on it locks in and it makes sense the authors of um what we call the

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:14.280
apocalypse they didn't they they didn't assemble something that was meant to drive us all nuts that we wouldn't

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:19.520
understand right they're not going to be able to talk outside of their natural

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.440
cilene oracular um expressions and that's what they're using it's it's the

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.599
the apocalypse is all siblin it's it's early earlier than John reprocessed by

01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:38.599
John in fact Kelis when kelus is describing the Christians he says that he's he branches

01:01:38.599 --> 01:01:45.760
them out he says the people that call themselves Christians are among the first thing he says is civilist then he

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:51.240
says simonian then he names up uh maronites a couple other groups first

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:57.400
thing he says though civilist so I'm like the the cilis are tied to the Christians

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:03.599
early on early on and everyone knew it kelsus is prime example of giving you

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:10.760
telling you that right away when he says the people that we call Christians are these groups and the first name he gives

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:18.680
civilist so he talks a lot about that too n nice that's good backup what do

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:25.760
you think about give me your opinion Neil about the transformation he does this to three different women um he

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:32.920
transforms them into men what do you think is the significance of that there's this idea of coming reborn

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:40.960
in transformation metamorphosis ID don't look look let's ID appus bakus all these

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:47.200
texts that are called metamorphosis the story is you start off in this place you

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:54.720
go through your passion and then you come out metamorphosized that's the whole that's that's the tragedy of life

01:02:54.720 --> 01:03:00.319
you know how nii talks about the appolloni and dionan to combined is a

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:07.359
tragedy you can't have one without the other it's like a ying and the Yang dionis the dark Apollo the light they're

01:03:07.359 --> 01:03:12.760
like a ying yang they have to they're opposites of each other EP dianis is

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:19.000
cthonic underworld dark vegetation moisture the underworld that pushes the

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:25.440
moisture up Apollo he's underworld and Apollo is Heavenly in the sky he's a

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:30.480
lightbringer he's the he he's the light that goes down and those two together is

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:36.359
the metamorphosis it's the tragedy so you have to go through that in your life everybody's supposed to go through that

01:03:36.359 --> 01:03:43.760
in a lifetime that's a fulfilled life that's a complete life and it's a it's amazing that the

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:51.880
orix use the very same conceptions with the arrows of AOS they're either gold or

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:57.200
they're black and people are always or cyanic they described cyanic dark black

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:02.680
something like that and um people always ask what's the difference between those

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:10.359
um arrows and Aphrodite because Aphrodite is sometimes described as golden and sometimes as dark right and

01:04:10.359 --> 01:04:15.440
she Lo loses those when she enters that dark morning she becomes that Queen of

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:21.000
the underworld so you see the very same thing it's going on between Apollo and

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.520
dionisis it's some kind of physics that they're explaining about how the

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:31.880
cosmos works yeah it's gorgeous Neil I I mean it makes you kind of want to join

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:38.520
one of these ancient Cults you know what I mean just to just to get access to if nothing else all the good Scrolls you

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:44.680
know what I mean yeah I understand it I don't have anything like I get it I understand these thing like when I look

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:51.520
at the ancient world and I see this culture I'm like wow makes sense that seems like like the elisian Mysteries

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:59.760
okay Deiter and bakus Vine and and uh Vine and uh grain right Bread and Wine

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:07.480
those two moisture dryness they to come together in the cup you mentioned that cup that Eucharist you take the cup you

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:13.680
die you go through a a psychedelic trip you die and then you have an orgy all

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:19.160
night you go through this wild ecstatic experience to become a new person have

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:25.200
this experience that you'll never forget by Dawn they would do it all night this is what they describe the Mysteries when

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:30.480
you get initiated all night long you are tripping on this Kon you're having these

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:35.599
orgies you're going through it then they bring out the phus in this box this holy

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:40.680
box in the heropants you they're holding it and you the initiate are the only

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:46.520
person who's allowed to touch it you open the box you bring out the FAS you touch it and then you put it back then

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:51.960
you say the magic words I have get taken from the box I put back in the box then

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:58.680
as Dawn starts to rise up as this as the lightbringer as Lucifer starts to show up you are supposed to go to a Baptist

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:03.839
you go to the Next Room the telesterion you take a bath sacred bath you get

01:06:03.839 --> 01:06:09.480
washed after you're washed you come out it's Dawn it's daylight you are reborn

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:16.520
the people who went through this experience we have testimonies all of them all the testimonies are all saying I've no

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:22.319
longer feared death I am saved I'm S I have salvation they all experienced this

01:06:22.319 --> 01:06:27.359
thing so whatever was going on in these Mysteries was changing people's lives to

01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:33.119
the point where for example this is my next video that I'm about to release in the next day or two about Dian Isis

01:06:33.119 --> 01:06:38.279
there was a guy from from uh India his name is zaris he traveled all the way

01:06:38.279 --> 01:06:44.559
from India to go meet up with Augustus as a um messenger from King porus the

01:06:44.559 --> 01:06:50.160
Indian king he wanted to send delegates to offer a a hand and pieace like we're

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:56.440
going to have peace the the Romans and the Indians we you know there's no war between us blah blah blah blah blah so

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:01.520
he sends over this delegate zaris and zaris knew about the elidan Mysteries

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:08.359
all the way in India dianis was so famous he's worshiped everywhere everyone knows who dianis is he gets to

01:07:08.359 --> 01:07:14.880
Athens he gets up at the Augustus he go they go to El eloin Mysteries they open it up even though it's out of season

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:20.440
because it's Augustus Augustus can do stuff he's the August one he's the Augustus so they opened it up they let

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:26.839
this guy get initiated what does he do right this is going to sound crazy but I kind of in a weird way I kind of like

01:07:26.839 --> 01:07:33.279
understand it this guy got initiated went through that experience that I just explained and then after the next

01:07:33.279 --> 01:07:40.640
morning jumped into a fire and killed himself and then he wrote they wrote on his Tombstone that he had nothing else

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:47.640
in life that he needed to fulfill his he wanted to end his time as the brahin do it says like is's a custom of the brahin

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:53.920
that when you are fulfilled you end your life there's no point you go on to the next and he felt after being in

01:07:53.920 --> 01:08:01.440
initiated into the rights of bakas emiter there was nothing else to be done I want to end it wow that's crazy that's

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:07.920
that's and that's in like 10 different that's in like four I think four or five different sources uh cassus Dio says it

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:15.000
Nicholas of Damascus a couple other people have this written in this in different ways but it's it's well sourced this happened so he was with

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.719
Augustus and strangely enough that text tonight that I showed you from in the

01:08:20.719 --> 01:08:27.000
Latin that is a Formula that the text says is taken from Augustus that he's

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:33.359
the one who uses it right he's using this really Advanced formula so yeah it

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:38.798
it's uh it it makes you wonder Neil when when people are going through it and

01:08:38.799 --> 01:08:46.278
they're professional like upstanding you know good people and intelligent people

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:51.400
that you trust like Cicero and they say that you got to go through these rights

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:56.520
because you you really aren't aware where before you do yeah you know who

01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:01.880
got you know the list of people who got I'll give you a short list of people who were initiated into the eloen

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:09.838
Mysteries um Julius Caesar Cleopatra Marcus Aurelius Olympus Queen the uh the

01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:16.480
mother of Alexander the Great Alexander the Great Augustus I mean that's just a short list of like the some of the most

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:21.640
famous people in world history Plato Socrates all those people in Athens they

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:28.480
all did this this was a you had to or else who were you if you didn't get it initiated they all did this it was a way

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:34.838
of purging the people it was a way of somehow keeping that democracy going and

01:09:34.839 --> 01:09:41.600
I know it predates it but it does something for the people there's something in that Purge that changes

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.758
your perspective that kind of I don't know is it freeing you know is that what

01:09:46.759 --> 01:09:53.758
it is essentially it just frees your mind because it allows you to experience what's beyond that point of death what's

01:09:53.759 --> 01:10:00.040
before that point of birth you know it it the stuff is the fact that they have

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:07.440
constructed and when you talk about elus ELO they didn't just sit down one day and say oh my God we're gonna figure out

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:12.600
this right right that's that's been handed down that Bronze Age mystery

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:19.000
right you know had such a profound effect on the world yeah you know they

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.040
said it it lasted past like they don't even know how old it is they there

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:30.400
sources of it in the Myan period so it's at least Bronze Age at least but it

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:36.120
lasts all the way to 500 AD they couldn't get rid of it even the even like the worst Christian Emperors that

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:42.120
tried to shut it down couldn't it took a long time that it was the last thing to go out of all the Pagan religions the

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:48.600
last thing because nobody wanted to lose it everybody loved it and so you know what they did to end it Christians are

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:55.679
you got to hand it to them they're kind of smart they're slick they co-opted it they created a a a a new story about St

01:10:55.679 --> 01:11:00.960
Demetrius Demetrius means deer's son and he was a he was an initiate and El was

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.760
indan mysteries in the fifth century and they said that Deiter came to him in a

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:12.800
dream and told him that they needed to convert ELO zinian to an orthodox church

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:18.280
and this is what your decree is and so they obviously you know converted it

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:23.640
into a church that church is still there today it's an orthodox church but they had to go that route to get rid of it

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:30.440
they couldn't just do it out of popular vote or people not wanting it they had to do it in a in a slick way so that's

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:37.199
that that guy's name is St Demetrius to this day it was kind of like rewriting history wasn't it I mean if you st

01:11:37.199 --> 01:11:45.040
Orphus they have a St Orpheus orus he's holding a a liar in his hand it's Orpheus but his name St Orpheus they had

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:50.920
to co-op these things they were too popular too big for people to just cancel you know what I mean yeah

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:57.800
Christianity is built on oric physics so there there's no there's no way that you couldn't deny the connection I love that

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:05.360
all right I'm going to give you the last comment throw in anything you want and thanks for coming tonight Neil well I
