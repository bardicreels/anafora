a you you've turned into light um I love the uh uh uh the interview as I've seen

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.960
so far I love it unfortunately I had to prep today so for those of you who don't

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.160
know Neil's interview with Danny Jones just came out and it's doing

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.720
smashingly uh it is yeah say something about it Neil throw us into the you know

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:03.160
throw us into the pot and let's get down and dirty I had to follow your bit from Year from

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.800
from seven days ago and I was like I don't there's no way I'm be able to compete with that with the fire that you

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.320
brought but apparently the algorithm is favoring my video just as much and it's

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.720
it's it's it's it's up there so we'll see what happens I'm thinking maybe

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.360
combined you and I can get Danny combined to 10 million views by the end

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.319
of the year okay okay that's a prediction and you know me I don't do

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:39.080
predictions I um I hope you're right because uh the more people that this

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:46.160
reaches the more people that get this information um the better we have done

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:54.400
as an ancient Museum right right we get them we feed them I noticed in your interview um that

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.280
uh uh you're direct with the sources I like that a lot you guys went back you

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:08.120
went back to the percus you know TOS the the Oxford great let me tell him that

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.919
story so yeah go ahead go ahead he was asking me questions about some of the

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:21.120
some of the uh controversies surrounding your interview and the criticisms you got he says the big one that he was

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.560
getting from people you know people were emailing him messaging him leaving comments saying that Almon is wrong

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.840
about lays Almon is wrong about stay so I said all right well let's let's test it out let's look it up so we went on

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.360
went on the percus tffs and we went to went into Alis we asked Alice in Wonderland what does l stat mean we

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.520
found out that it means pirate and Buccaneer and by the way we're in Tampa Bay home with the Buccaneers so we were

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.560
in Tampa Bay home with the lace days baby so we found yeah we I we you know I

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.800
showed Danny how to use Ellis and he was he was impressed fantastic so it was real it's

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.440
real Bic stuff and I noticed then you went to some of the early Christian sources I don't want to spoil it cuz

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:14.280
people want to see it but you did some early Christian stuff and you're talking oh God epiphanous or somebody and uh uh

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.680
about all those sex Neil you got something about Christian sex you like

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.840
all those different groups don't you with you know they go back to the nickel

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:32.639
you know what I mean and you know what they were doing and you were talking about the the gospel the gospel of these

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:40.639
people right and what is what does Mary do to Jesus please in

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:46.680
YouTube friendly and educationally education let's be educational this is

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:52.199
Lady Babylon it's a place of the museum it's education tell me in that with that

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:59.560
kind of feel tell me uh what Mary and Jesus are doing up on the mountain so

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:05.599
beanus lists about seven different groups he lists the barites the zakan

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:11.120
the uh Stites and he says he names a whole list of list of these groups from

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.639
all different areas from Asia Minor Syria Greece Rome uh North Africa all

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:23.080
these different areas and there all these different names they're named after their leader whoever their Leader's name is they're zakan or

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:29.759
whatever and he says that they all have in common a gospel and the name of the Gospel is called the questions of mar

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:36.839
Mary and he says in this gospel Jesus Takes Mary up on the mountain and says

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:44.279
and then what he does is he performs a right some sort of magical right where he produces a woman out of the side of

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:49.360
his rib so he becomes a male and female at the same time and he produces the

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.240
woman then he uh goes and continues to have intercourse with this said woman

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:01.480
produces sperm from this and then hands it over to Mary and says if you want to

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:09.320
make it into the kingdom of heaven you must drink my blood and eat my flesh this is my SARS that I give to you Mary

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:15.839
goes oh my God I can't handle it she falls down in the ground he picks her up and he says what don't you have any

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:21.279
faith woman it's like something it sounds like something Jesus would actually say too

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:29.040
that's the crazy part about this gospel okay okay now here's here's my question so you can poo poo that and say oh it's

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:36.440
the um certain group of Christians writing about another group of Christians and poo pooing what they're doing and so

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.640
it's obviously exaggerated can you believe though that so many of these

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:49.720
sources all link up and show us we know from other sources the aites are drinking seman right we we know that for

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:57.720
a fact the aites are a Christian sect right they're the serpant I love the name man like imagine what are you what

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:05.959
are you what are you I'm a I'm a cilene serpent that's what the Christians were calling themselves right oh my God

00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:15.160
ophites and the ones on the outside of the ofits were like oh no we can't do that so so uh Mary is consuming the Hima

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:23.560
of Jesus that's fantastic um tell me something I want to say something about Danny really quick um Danny Jones right

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:11.160

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:26.160
beautiful beautiful okay I'm gonna give you a chance to say one thing and then I'm going to jump to uh uh tonight's

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:32.959
talk and if you want to hang around later dial up um if you need to go about your business go about your business but

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:38.959
I'll leave you with a comment what do you want to say yeah so we ended up talking about

00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:44.959
the uh different uh different things that we find in Christianity that seem

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:54.240
to mimic a lot of these mystery religions of the time period for example the hararia ritual of in Rome also down

00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.200
in Egypt for Addis and Osiris um and it's at the same in the same week that

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:06.880
the Adonia is going on over in uh in Cyprus and there's also a great dionesia

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:12.440
they call or no the rural diania which is going on at that week so they had the rural diania and they had the city

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:18.680
diania in the winter time the rural diania happens in the spring so there's this spring equinox Festival sprouting

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:25.760
up and they all have this thing in common where a God is dead mourned over

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.959
and then Rises and in the case of case of the Addis ritual they bury this tree

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:39.079
a pine tree they bury the pine tree They Mourn for three days they even have initiation ceremonies where the Unix are

00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:45.480
initiated and becomes Priests of magnam mat and then they uh celebrate the

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:52.000
hararia which is in Latin means rejoicing and that's the resurrection of Addis and this happens and it's a threed

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.279
day period from the day they bury the tree to the day they Rejoice is a three day on the third day just as Christ does

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:04.480
by the way Osiris has two women that go to his tomb at the end of the story

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.600
nepus and Isis just as Jesus has Mary and Mary uh and Martha go to the Tomb at

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:17.399
the end so we're talking about all this stuff lining up epiphanius is a he's an informant you got to give him that title

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:25.160
he's snitching on himself he starts talking about all these other duus and ion having both being born of a virgin

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:31.519
at the winter solstice epiphanius was an informant you got to give him credit where credits due that's why it doesn't

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:39.160
surprise anybody when you walk into a second century uh synagogue um and you

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:44.760
see that it's got Ion on the wall right um doesn't surprise anybody in a bunch

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:53.440
of Greek yeah no doubt I loved your um yo comments today um and what uh what

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:59.800
you were doing was you know you can't undo that once somebody has seen

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:06.639
oh guess what the the the Bible the Old Testament where the Torah was written in

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:15.079
the third Century BC you know and before that there's Jack for any of this when

00:14:15.079 --> 00:14:21.600
Neil when you go in and you say where are the quotes give me all the quotes in Hebrew that they're passing down from

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:28.600
the oh they're not it doesn't exist you mean Judaism was created in the 3

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:34.720
century oh I love the fact that you you know um

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:40.519
uh with the Dead Sea Scrolls one thing I want to make uh um I want people to

00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:46.680
understand is you never find those just Hebrew things sitting around because they don't exist you always find them

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.160
with the Greek that They're copying from so you know what you you know what I saw

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:59.120
you know what I saw when I was in Nazareth I was in Nazareth and I was on a dig there was a dig there we were

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:05.720
walking through and there's mosaics on the ground and there is Orpheus the biggest Mosaic of all there's a dianis

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:12.519
one a horn diis one that was a small one the biggest one I saw was orus with his

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:19.160
liar and it was huge and it was a uh first century SL and I say something it

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:26.560
might be second century but it's F first century ad second century ad somewhere in that time period and it's orus and by

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.920
the way also what they found in this place is the golden oric tablets in this

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:39.480
is this is Nazareth so Jesus grew grew up in this city completely hellenized complete

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:45.000
Greek mosaics all over the place a there's a theater there too yeah and

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.399
about his language people always ask what language did Jesus speak and some say Aramaic or syri or you um any of the

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:59.000
Hebrew Bri it's all the regular variety you got to realize kid was sent to E

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.839
Egypt where did he probably go in Egypt um wherever he went they were speaking

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:10.399
Greek nobody ever asked why doesn't Jesus come back from where he was raised

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:15.839
speaking Egyptian doing the Egyptian thing because they didn't freaking speak

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:21.880
Egyptian in in Egypt they spoke Greek and who were who is the they that I'm

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:27.120
talking about all the Educators you can sit around and come up with phony ideas

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.199
about what was this and what was that the fact is through the museum in

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:37.440
Alexandria came the greatest work from Antiquity um intellectual the greatest

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:44.440
intellectual work all of the great doctors come through alexandrian Physicians helenistic Physicians who

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:50.920
were doing for the first time the first time they're doing regular autopsies

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:56.120
they're doing regular anatomical dissections not only that they're doing

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:03.480
Viv sections Viv they get a criminal you know and take them apart look it I saw a

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:10.678
description of a dude's peristalsis that's the motion of your intestines and

00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:17.480
the doctors had just cut this guy open and they're looking at it they're following the movement and they're saying it was obviously XY and z and

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:25.480
they're studying digestion that's all from Alexandria that's the Egypt that Jesus went to and when he when he comes

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:32.600
back and everybody there thinks he's a brainiac it's because of that education so what language is Jesus speaking I

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:40.200
dare you to give me one freaking quote in Hebrew Arabic syc anywhere no no no

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:49.400
all of his quotes are Greek surprise surprise people don't understand it Judaism is an invention of the helenic

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:59.799
world Moses is museus and it is an orphic saturnian or satanic religion sun

00:17:59.799 --> 00:18:05.400
moon stars Dawn Dawn yeah

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:12.400
orus and we have the uh derveni Papyrus which is it's the one the the the actual

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:18.000
physical copy not the text dated to the text is dated to the 6th Century BC the

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.880
physical fragments 4th Century BC the physical copy of it not the dating of

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.640
the text the text itself 6th Century BC but in this text orus is called

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:35.480
Theologian and he's constantly revealing it's the it's the word apocalypse he's

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.919
the apocalypse the revealer it's a it's a it's an apocalyptic genre which is

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:46.400
orphic by by by um nature and these are this is what Sprouts up in Alexandria

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:53.799
during this time period during this helenistic era these alexandrians who are who are greek-speaking Jewish people

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:59.280
who are you know it brought the Alexandria after talmy wins a war in God

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:05.120
against Demetrius this is real history look it up anyways they start they start

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.440
talking making up stories they start writing stories about this guy named Moses who they say and this is the the

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:16.559
earliest sources we got from aristobulus from from heus from all these different

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:23.440
from these early early sources say that his this is musas and he was the either

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.720
in some sources he's either the father of orus or the son of orus depending on which one's talking about it either

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:37.159
either way they're connecting him to orus and they're claiming orus is this pist the word p means player played by a

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:44.919
harp sung by a harp so or orphism apocalypticism theology itself is an

00:19:44.919 --> 00:19:51.919
orphic Pythagorean you know sort of genre that we get in Alexandria and

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:58.799
that's this becomes yahwism it's where you get yaho even macrobius even macrobius is citing what is Microbus

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:04.360
site when he talks about yaho orus yeah and remember you said you said

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:10.240
today you were going to say it as I was watching your interview you mentioned plutar and you were gonna say that

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:19.400
Plutarch says Judaism is an offshoot of bakic worship he says it in Antiquity

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:28.039
you know what that is that is a fir hand witness that is an eyewitness you cannot

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:34.480
get better historical evidence than an eyewitness who's watching what's going on and

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:40.760
Reporting it you know what else plutar does Plutarch cites Hackus of abdera who

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.799
lived four centuries before him four maybe five centuries before him yeah

00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:52.080
Plutarch is late first early second uh heus is fourth Century late fourth

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.720
Century early third Century BC all right so yeah they're three centuries away from each other three or four century

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:03.960
away from each other he cites Hackus of abdera you know what he says he says the

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:10.480
Egyptians use the term Ammon not just for the one God but for any of the Gods

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:19.320
and they use it as a form of address to close an incantation he says the word amen is a

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.400
coming it it comes from the god Ammon who is the representative of the cosmos

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:30.600
itself the hidden one so when you call Amen to somebody you're call to the hidden one you're closing your

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:37.400
incantation plutar said plutar cites heus of abdera who he says told them all

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:44.200
this by the way before he heus of ABA nobody ever uses Amen in any

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:49.720
sources ever so right so you there's no ugaritic there's no ugaritic text that

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:55.240

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:39.640
to be later it has to be in the anod Dominy range some people say look it's

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:46.960
orphic and it's probably fifth fourth Century BC right so okay um U the does

00:26:05.399 --> 00:26:10.440
of course there's a much more you know realistic scientific and anthropological

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:19.480

that's the guardian goddess and many of you are going to see the name Aphrodite right after it you're going to

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:58.919
be confused because the little bit that you know of Greek history you're getting through mythology

00:26:58.919 --> 00:27:04.480
that's where it's just being transmitted and mythology's turned into entertainment just like the stage has

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:12.480
turned into entertainment you little consuming don't say

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:20.159
that everything is profane but it had a sacred intent the

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:28.799
theater today movie cinema that's profane it is entertainment it

00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:34.480
Antiquity they're doing it to purify and they're not doing it for

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:54.480
Athena is there right and who else emus Artemis is there they are all what

00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:04.679
you're seeing is the band of women who are those Queens from the Bronze Age

00:30:04.679 --> 00:30:12.200
Artemus do you know what Artemis does she hunts she kills her bands of

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:18.000
followers will kill you yeah she's known to strike from afar

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.159
she became a symbol of the huntress who takes your life if you're a woman isn't

00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:32.960
that neat who is that for the force that takes your life if you're a woman she's called lucifera she's

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:38.159
given that title of lightbringer right lucifera you mean the

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:44.679
devil was female before he was male yep do you have a problem with that it's

00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:53.519

00:30:58.679 --> 00:31:04.240
with the Medusa let's keep going um this is just I wanted to show you the verb

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:11.159
right um to protect to rule over and then you can trace the history of it that's fantastic go to the next one um

00:31:11.159 --> 00:31:17.679
for people in uh in history who think you know hey um women did not rule um

00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:24.880
the name there is that they did the name tells you otherwise to the unreality of

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:32.399
what the historians give you because historians suck and do not work

00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:40.120
with primary sources we had a an ancient historian who came um into the classics

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:47.760
department and he was awful and everybody knew it right everybody knew his philologic his translation capacity

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:53.200
was garbage it was about where a f an entry-level graduate students should be

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:58.519
why is that I don't hold it against him but because he was a historic he wasn't

00:31:58.519 --> 00:32:04.919
a classical philologist he was a historian but here's the problem if you can't read those sources you don't know

00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:12.760
what the hell's going on you don't all your ideas you guys know I don't give you ideas I give you sources let's go

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:18.440
back to the source this is too pretty to lose tonight in my

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:28.840
pontification deos oyos here's that oyas that Dan mlen doesn't like look at the

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:57.000
it shows the extent of where the Bible education is able to take you it's not

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.600
very a a not able to take you very far here we're going to go a little bit deeper what is this this is orphic

is it I don't know who cares right the fact is this document this helenistic

00:42:10.839 --> 00:42:16.720
document it reads as if it was a contemporary with the

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:34.359
ready now this is the Book of Enoch and people say why is that not in Hebrew because it's not it never existed in

00:42:34.359 --> 00:42:41.480
Hebrew here's what it existed in here's the Gea fragment that we have of it probably from some library that the

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:51.280

drugs how to collect Roots how to identify specific

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:52.480
plants and they stained themselves who are we talking

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.680
about we're talking about a group of people with a technical knowledge that's

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:05.200
obviously superior to the groups of people that they're infiltrating or that they're immigrating to be among and this

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:10.480
is not uncommon you get it in Italy too right media steps off the boat in Italy

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:17.119
and somebody's notices somebody's getting bitten by certain type of snake and she has a remedy and cures the guy

00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:23.960
and they're like huh holy crap we'll build you a temple right because they've been

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:30.359
plagued by that snake for years and you know what they they didn't develop it they probably they were you know

00:44:30.359 --> 00:44:36.680
speaking Martian or you know not from Mars but osin or umry who knows one of

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:42.400
the maybe the Latin a bunch of hot dwellers you know what I mean just

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:49.000
backwards so when you come in with that new technology are you an alien now for everybody who wants to think that's an

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:56.520
alien um have at it you know enjoy enjoy um

00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:01.839
somebody from from space yeah no that's not what the evidence points to the evidence points to here are groups of

00:45:01.839 --> 00:45:08.440
people who are technologically advanced and as a matter of fact that's exactly what it says they become famous through

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:15.280
their Tech and what is their Tech Enoch tells us their Tech their Tech is

00:45:15.559 --> 00:45:21.559
drugs ananan are not aliens they're drug

00:45:21.559 --> 00:45:27.800
Runners oh God they're people with a superior knowledge dude all go to the

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:34.240
next text let's see these guys where do they show up you know and it's because the it's through the notice it's through

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:41.040
the ladies through the ladies I'm going to show you some things that are you think is this a man's

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:48.599
art you'd think what kind of art is this and why is the text differentiating watch Watch

00:45:48.599 --> 00:45:54.440
What Happens it'll show us it'll Arc to the original Christ it's gorgeous because what we're doing is we're

00:45:54.440 --> 00:46:00.520
tracing the knowledge the pharmaceutical knowledge just follow the pharmaceutical knowledge and see where it ends up

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:07.839
that's all we're doing um wonderful isn't that gorgeous Cersei pull up the Bible pull up the Bible now that's what

00:46:07.839 --> 00:46:14.400
we need look at verse number four this is from Genesis chapter 6 Hoy the gigant

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:20.079
do you hear the word giant ho gigant there were giants there in the earth in

00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:26.960
those days right and after that when the sons of God came into the daughters of

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:35.880
of men and they knew them in a very very intimate lovey stinky

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:43.000
way and what happens they were giants right they're giving birth to

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.319
these Generations that are bathed in the tech that they have got they're burning

00:46:49.319 --> 00:46:55.480
off mortality and do you know what happens you change stature

00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:01.760
itself these are hormone analoges right and what are they doing what are the Giants doing how does

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:06.800
it describe them on the last line they're op ionos op

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:13.280
ionos wait what okay they're from the ion hang on to that thought and then the

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:19.400
very last thing he says is these are people who were very

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:26.440
famous very famous known for that knowledge they were big people yeah

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:36.480
these people people were important gigas they're all wait a minute they're the gigas they're from that stage of the

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:41.920
Medusa do you understand they're using the very same

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:49.400
serpents uhuh it's Tech and they're spreading the cult Tech give me the next

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:55.000
one give me the next one are they from outer space what why do people always

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.079
jump right people be scientific give me you got it um let's look at the

00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:05.680
translation of this in those days and for some time after giant nephilites

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:12.000
what that text didn't say nephilites it's because everybody has bought the

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.280
lie that the Hebrew text comes before the

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:31.520
septuagenarian right that's when that thing shows up that's not real that's a creation what does the old text say it

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:39.400
says what I just showed you in Greek about Giants so the use of the word nephilites is only coming through a

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:44.800
rinic tradition right and because Christianity

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:52.000
needs that rinic tradition to prop itself up on it can't contradict that so

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.400
it's a very very sticky problem for theologians for Bible students

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:04.760
for Christians who just are practicing their Christianity people who are born again and have seen the forgiving blood

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:12.880
of Jesus Christ it's for those people oh love this um whenever the sons of God

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:19.720
had intercourse seriously that's not very elegant um there are heroes it doesn't say that but famous Warriors

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:26.680
they're little bit elaborating there it doesn't say anything about being Warriors um but okay fantastic let's

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:32.160
let's go to the next one um now you know why translation sucks so bad right um

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:37.520
watch this people what is the Nephilim look how they Define it now right so now

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:44.079
this lying translation based upon a lying tradition is telling you that this is

00:49:44.079 --> 00:49:52.160
coming from this word and how do they define this word with the Greek word

00:49:53.640 --> 00:50:01.319
giant do you know what neph name is it's a madeup term that was a forced term in

00:50:01.319 --> 00:50:07.760
order to translate the word giant it doesn't exist it is a

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.839
fabrication what is the Nephilim what are the Nephilim nothing there are

00:50:12.839 --> 00:50:20.799
nothing in history yeah hisory that's the inquiry right when you

00:50:20.799 --> 00:50:27.079
know yourself did you know your religion was a fabrication

00:50:27.079 --> 00:50:33.000
right welcome to the school of monism that's what they do they did it in Egypt

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.760
too and they end up getting aan and with this terrible art with these big pregnant bellies on you know people I

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:46.480
don't know wasn't with pregnant women it was on pregnant men they look pregnant

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:55.000
anyway it's the style you gota en you gota anyway everybody's like Bo and they got rid of it right so okay

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.760
give me the text give me watch what what what look what now what is the root nafo

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:07.760
what does it mean to fall to fall so they're like huh how can we represent because we don't actually

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:13.319
know right we know that these are famous people right what do we have to do we

00:51:13.319 --> 00:51:19.599
have to turn them into something they're not what you making those Fallen call them the Fallen right no no no what are

00:51:19.599 --> 00:51:27.520
you doing in the thir Century with your Torah what are you doing you're creating

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:34.799
something to justify your past you're mimicking what the Greeks

00:51:34.799 --> 00:51:40.359
are doing with their texts you're doing the same thing that's why you call Adam

00:51:40.359 --> 00:51:46.319
Adam because it's a well-known name within the right right it's all about

00:51:46.319 --> 00:51:53.280
that right that mystery is everything that's the predominant religious engine

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:59.040
when the Torah or the septu the P whatever you want to call penit and the

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:05.680
prophets whatever you want to call them that's when that's being written the mystery is everything this is is is a

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:11.040
testerian that Moses builds oh

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:18.040

eight right megabytes sorry sorry wrong realm chewy corrected me me you know I'm

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:19.960
even I'm way smaller way smaller did I say gigabytes because the Giants that I

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:27.480
was okay here's the eye on the eternity look it's opposite to Kronos time

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:32.680
time it is not eternity it is that which is opposite to

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:39.200
time okay are you ready well I'm going to take you to the ion and we're doing this for a good reason boom hit hit me

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:46.520
with the next one um ion think of the soul and ion as

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:53.599
being um both parts two parts of one Duality that is

00:55:53.599 --> 00:55:59.000
existence okay if you take the those two concepts and say oh they got married and

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:06.720
that's us go to the next one um here's your Ion

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:13.400
right and the Christians will say oh God this is eternal no I want you to see I want you to see the the um look at the

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:20.760
first line under a and it talks about Poseidon return by Ain and then at the end it says in parenthesis properly and

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:26.799
then it gives you the Dima in the middle of the word I won

00:56:26.799 --> 00:56:33.039
so again this is a Bronze Age concept this is so far before Christian

00:56:33.039 --> 00:56:38.400
Christianity and Judaism that it's it's a it's an unfamiliar saturnian or

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:46.400
satanic world yeah and who is the ion he's the dude when you go into a Jewish

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:51.799
synagogue in the second century or first century and you walk in and you see him

00:56:51.799 --> 00:56:58.240
on the wall with Greek surrounding him and a zodiac you'll know where your

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:03.559
Jewish roots are and I'm sure there's a lot of people who are suddenly like oh

00:57:03.559 --> 00:57:09.960
that kind of Mak sense I kind of want I've always been looking at that zodiac thing yeah congratulations welcome home

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:17.599

00:57:17.599 --> 00:57:23.680
people right it's oric fantastic um go to the next one okay now here's what I'm

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:30.640
going to give you and this one is for uh Dan mlen because this is pendor and I

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:37.480
know for a fact because pendor people is really really difficult pendar you know

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:44.480
some there are some class somewhere I'm sure who like nah no I can do pendar no problem pendar is no problem but most

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:50.839
classes if they're honest with themselves know that pendar is of is of the more difficult persuasion he uses a

00:57:50.839 --> 00:57:58.200
lot of Dorian and it just you know it's just I don't know Dorian is just it's just eruptive I think the Athenians were

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:04.160
right um they had breed that apex of the language they were able to draw where

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:10.000
you can draw out of The Ether and I don't think the Dorian was doing them any favors or pushing them up you know

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:15.680
what I mean it what just the ionians you could ask the

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:22.079
ionians too they would been like yep historian that's why the Spartans are the way they are

00:58:22.079 --> 00:58:29.240

don't even know your own Bible it's disgusting I'll tell you when I when I taught seminar I told him on the first

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:35.839
day of class first day of class you do not know the Bible you do not ever read

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:42.839
it you've never read it before and by the end of the third semester they were all telling me I understand what that

01:02:42.839 --> 01:02:48.279
means now yeah exactly that's the power of

01:02:48.279 --> 01:02:54.440
this language until you get there don't say that you know this stuff right bring

01:02:54.440 --> 01:03:01.760

off to do to they're GNA abduct they're gonna take a fleece with a song in it

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:14.640
that is part of the mystery it's the directions for the

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:20.319
communion it is the life right it's why it has a dragon posted there to guard it

01:03:20.319 --> 01:03:27.680
the dragon just like the Medusa is a position right Within Bronze Age

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:34.079
Society right it's not a dragon it's not where is tolken where is tolken if toi

01:03:34.079 --> 01:03:40.440
was here I would what would I do I would make unic for the Kingdom of Heaven that's what I

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:45.559
would do um here's what we go um they don't want to be left behind right and

01:03:45.559 --> 01:03:51.640
some D undang they want to find that drug give me the next one give me the next

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:57.720
one look at this this is John 3:16 what is it that Jesus is offering

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:03.240
remember in Mark he offers you drugs that induce death right and snakes and

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:09.079
vulnerability to snakes awesome um which goes along with the formula I that's the

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:14.440
whole deal that's what boy is doing right the boy is providing an immunity

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:22.119
basically for the poison that is the Thon okay um John 316 here he is right

01:04:22.119 --> 01:04:30.039
oh God God so loved the world the ca Cosmos the cosmos is the

01:04:30.079 --> 01:04:35.279
present the present functioning or it's the lines it's it's difficult to

01:04:35.279 --> 01:04:42.160
describe Cosmos is that which beautifies most essentially and when I say beautify

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:47.359
I mean um to make healthy you know what a woman's Cosmos is literally an

01:04:47.359 --> 01:04:55.359
Antiquity it's the the um chest that she possesses that contains all of her drugs

01:04:55.359 --> 01:05:01.760
CA Medics and anything for personal hygiene yeah it's her

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:09.319
salvation right those elements are her salvation and what does it do it brings her it brings her to a place of health

01:05:09.319 --> 01:05:14.599
and now if nobody's figured out the sacred name of Aphrodite the name of

01:05:14.599 --> 01:05:20.000
Rome then something is wrong I am not doing something

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.240
right but I'm confident I'm confident you will come to the place of Health

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:32.640
and salvation I'm confident um fantastic that's where we are give me the next

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:40.279
Source quick before it wears off um no he he loved the world so much he he did what he did he gave his son he gave his

01:05:40.279 --> 01:05:47.640
only born son in order that everyone who believes in him right may not perish but

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:54.640
have zoan ionian and that's why we brought in the ion right because that's what we're

01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:03.240
looking for give me the next one and I just want to make sure that you understand this ion right is defined

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:11.039
here in Greek now they're going to give you period of existence this is what the Greek says the Greek definition Telos

01:06:11.039 --> 01:06:16.440
it's the completion that bounds the time

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:23.160
of each person's life that's called the ion it's the completion and that's why a

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:29.760
toite is somebody who has been initiated in the mystery because they have been

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:36.520
able to see the completion of their life when you enter into

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:45.200
death you become one who is now outside of time in

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:52.400
ion don't ask me with the physics are I don't understand it but this is what they're doing and if you haven't been

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:58.760
there you don't have ionic life ciceros walking around very happy oh God I'm so

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:04.359
glad I went to the Mysteries I wasn't alive before I went I didn't see the

01:07:04.359 --> 01:07:13.440
world why was he able to do that because they resurrected the queen of the

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:20.240
underworld right how do you think you're going to see the completion of your life without seeing

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:30.480
her oh you say I'm a misogynist I don't have female divinities guess what guess

01:07:31.279 --> 01:07:37.200
what that's why you got to love the devil man cuz this is his place and

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:44.599
you're here being tortured for a reason isn't that gorgeous you know uh um

01:07:44.599 --> 01:07:53.000
somebody once told me a union psych uh psychoanalyst Slash therapist um slash

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.119
all around good person told me oh my you're so handsome thank you I know

01:07:59.119 --> 01:08:05.680
there's a told me this yian told me he said um look the one thing that they

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:12.480
used to crack Nazis after World War II was Mother if you make him he said you

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:19.040
can open up a Nazi with any kind of psychology and they have defenses they will not resist until you approach him

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:27.758
with the mother and for some reason the mother breaks him down isn't that gorgeous you know what the of fascism

01:08:27.759 --> 01:08:34.520
is a mother I guess it's because a because a mother wouldn't you know a mother

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:40.080
wouldn't do what a what a fascist would do I guess yeah it's I don't know it's

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:45.600
some kind of people I'm telling you I'm just a person of average intelligence I don't get the physics of all this stuff

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:52.960
but there's something there about the mother that breaks down that Nazi tendency yeah that gets inside you can

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:59.798
really Pierce somebody's conscience through a mother love that what would your mother say you

01:08:59.799 --> 01:09:04.880
jerk right I guess that's the idea right

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:11.838
right I wonder if H could you smack Hitler in the face and say what do you think all the mothers of the world think

01:09:11.839 --> 01:09:17.159
about you your stupid mustache right something like that I don't know I'm

01:09:17.159 --> 01:09:22.199
sure the yans didn't do that you know y had a chance to declare Hitler insane

01:09:22.199 --> 01:09:29.120
and he didn't do it can you imagine how that would have changed history oh it's too bad you didn't have

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:44.159
wanted you to see um so what we're with the media right and we're in that christing

01:13:44.159 --> 01:13:51.679
experience so that we can ex we can um see the ion so that our eyes are opened

01:13:51.679 --> 01:13:58.080
and we can have that ion and what is that ion remember this is the thing in the Jewish synagogue this is what they

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:04.199
worship right this is what Jewish people worship before they worship

01:14:04.199 --> 01:14:11.159
Yahoo right Yahoo is derived from ion and what is the ion this is an ancient

01:14:11.159 --> 01:14:17.560
Greek this is from hus a definition of what it is it's the beos ton anthrop

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:26.280
it's the life of humanity it's the life of humanity um the hypocrit he says took

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:34.880
this and he quotes them the hippocratics took this and turned it into um what is

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:42.719
existing within your spinal column it's that which gives you

01:14:42.719 --> 01:14:50.480
life it's that which innervates you the NAA or where we get our word nerve is

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:58.360
what they thought was that life capacity that can be channeled through the body

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:05.239
right this is that oh God this is that most powerful and they say that you can't live without this right so wait a

01:15:05.239 --> 01:15:10.400
minute you said I thought ion just means Eternal do you see how stupid Bible

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:16.080
scholars are do you see how stupid they are let's go back to the next one chewy

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:24.239
I can't I can't deal with any stupid Bible scholars anymore it's they're laughable they're laughably bad yeah

01:15:24.239 --> 01:15:30.960
okay so back to the Bible yeah um this is I wanted you to see how bad this

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:40.239
translation was it's just verse three of uh Hosea Hosea 13 I think it is 133 I'm

01:15:40.239 --> 01:15:46.960
pretty sure 133 and um he says on account of this um they will be what

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:53.400
they will be as clouds as clouds yeah and as what as

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.400
dros

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:05.679
or right what is that um that's the stuff that is the kind of the dros is

01:16:05.679 --> 01:16:12.600
really um it's related to the word hros it's coming from the same roote that hros is and hros is what comes out of

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:18.560
your Lover's armpits when you're when you're um actively engaged in

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:24.960
coidus um sweat AKA sweat and the sweat that is on those plants in the morning

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:31.360
that kind of evaporates in the air you know we call that do the glistening

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:39.679
do um people produce glistening D too they do um fantastic so um that's how

01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:45.639
they're looking at it right look at that's how they're looking at it don't look at it like some Modern that's the problem with scholarship it's all from

01:16:45.639 --> 01:16:52.520
Modern brains John Scarboro told me that first day of graduate school he said shut up and listen to me number one you

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:57.600
only pay attention to the sources he said put down every secondary book

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:05.440
you've got any anybody writing about it from the modern world put it down it's useless yeah I love it I love it that

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:10.800
was good instruction I owe him for that go to the go to the next one um yeah

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.880
yeah that one um and what happens um he says look so the translation says look

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:21.080
um these people they're going to be like these clouds you know they evaporate they're going to be like this drus this

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:26.239
do that evaporates right and they're going to be like Theus that's the dust

01:17:26.239 --> 01:17:35.159
that you sweep off of the um circular threshing floor yeah yeah and they're like that

01:17:35.159 --> 01:17:42.480
they're vapid they're just FL flowing away and then finally he says hos atmus these people are going to be like the

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:49.960
fog or the fumigation APO dakon now dakron literally means

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:55.520
tears tears okay you ready um but I know

01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:01.239
that those tears are um medical little

01:18:01.239 --> 01:18:08.159
lozenges pills right they talk about the tears of opium for example the stuff that drips off the Opium capsule when

01:18:08.159 --> 01:18:16.280
you scarify it or scarify it excuse me when you when you make a cut in it and it bleeds out this milky white solution

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:22.760
that has all of the goody good num nom in it and that little thing is called a

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:31.360
tear anyway you can make make tears as drugs and he says here um the fumigation

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:38.320
from the drugs that's what you're going to be like right you're just gonna be off you go and smoke right that's all

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:44.840
off you go now how did the Hebrew translate this right because remember this is not Greek translating Hebrew if

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:50.320
it was I'm going to have to see the word tears in Hebrew but you don't read this

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.400
translation of um and this translation is using the Hebrew just like the King

01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:02.280
James therefore they will be like the Morning Mist okay that's okay like the early duw that disappears nice like the

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:07.639
chaff swirling from a threshing floor so far so good Hebrew nice job like smoke

01:19:07.639 --> 01:19:14.159
escaping through a window what there's no window there and

01:19:14.159 --> 01:19:20.600
it's really not smoke it's really a vapor from a fumigation oh God these people are

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:28.199
terrible what's the Hebrew actually say look at the word that the Hebrew uses yeah asan smoke straight up of course

01:19:28.199 --> 01:19:35.040
very simple smoke okay you can see how we're downgrading to the third grade we're not talking about the Mist

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:40.920
produced by specific drugs but we're talking about the you know smoke I mean

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:46.520
that could be you know what you the stuff coming out from between your ears

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:54.840
right what's the next one and what what do they do with the that by the way is how they represent atmus right now no

01:19:54.840 --> 01:20:01.600
see it says Mist Vapor steam right okay go down go down what's the next one

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:09.480
what's the Hebrew git um no up one what's the Hebrew G for the ne Oh no you're right go down um what's the next

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:14.760
word the D on the tears right I want you to see what these tears are literally

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:23.239
it's tears but look number two that which drops like tears that's what I was talking you gum or sap right or the

01:20:23.239 --> 01:20:28.360
drugs that they using right this when they say sap and

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:35.239
what are they talking about medicinals in The Collection they talk about gay and talks about the tears all the time

01:20:35.239 --> 01:20:42.280
love it tears of the poppy baby give me tears of the poppy doesn't sound nice um

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:48.600
let's go to the next one um that which drops like tears gum or sap there it is

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:54.280
what's the first example they give us for that a cones do you know what a cones is Nea will get all excited

01:20:54.280 --> 01:21:00.360
because contes is um that Acacia that he's always talking about yeah there you

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:08.679
go you apparently you can get some kind of tears from it what what are these tears being translated to in Hebrew I am

01:21:08.679 --> 01:21:14.800
not kidding here people this is Aruba and I'm not talking about Jamaica

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:22.199
or you know any of the nice places to visit I'm not talking about St John or any of that kind of you know stuff I'm

01:21:22.199 --> 01:21:30.040
talking about Aruba the word for l or window or slle a ladis or a window how did you

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:35.520
people turn drugs into windows it's because if you were to talk to a third

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:41.760
grader and tell him read to him The Iliad he would write out a very very

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:49.400
dumb down version of that because his linguistic skill was a cap and that's

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:56.800
what we have when we're talking about 8,000 unique words in Hebrew we're talking about a app so when I say look

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:02.800
there's Tech here involved the Hebrew can't capture the tech the septu is not

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:08.440
a translation of any Hebrew there is no Hebrew that exists Hebrew is a lurgical

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:15.440
language with just a few words left okay was Jesus speaking Hebrew of

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:21.560
course he wasn't give me the next one we're almost done I'm sorry to take so long people

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:10.360
love it next one just a couple of words here for us to end off to get the sensation of where media is operating

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:18.480
because she's the original Maga right right she's the original Maga that every

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:26.440

drugs those Magi that came to Jesus looking for the star guess what let's

01:23:44.199 --> 01:23:52.560
just take a look at them give me the next one give me the next one you know what go all the way down I want to go all the way down to that one here we go

01:23:52.560 --> 01:24:00.000
we're going to finish up with this are you ready people what is this it's a Dream It's a dream that media's father

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:06.159
had and this is again from the oric argonautica it's a dream that he had and

01:24:06.159 --> 01:24:14.560
what does it say what does it say it says the very girl that he was

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:25.159
nurturing that taking care of that he was growing that girl he saw a star

01:24:25.199 --> 01:24:32.120
and what did that star do on the line before the break you'll see called poison in

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:38.080
HTO heat is that roote for desire lust

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:44.400
um that thing that drives you towards Eros right heos is always accompanying

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:50.600
Aphrodite that's what does that mean it means desire he made us desire do you

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:56.000
have that desire to cause that act ity to

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:05.159
perpetuate that's heos and what is heos what is desirable desirable it is her

01:25:05.159 --> 01:25:12.679
cpos and you will say to me this will always be translated as fold of her garment or

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:18.400
lap possibly bosom possibly bosom it is

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:24.560
let's show them here we go it is what the one after it yep

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:32.440
look at this people bosom or lap thank you Victorian England very nice very nice look at number two uhoh it equals I

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:39.760
Doon gunon that is the vagina and then it gives soranus who is a terrible that's a

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:46.360
terrible name for a gynecologist but that's what he is Dr serinus um and he's a gynecologist and

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:51.719
um he uses the term cpos just straight up for vagina now watch this those of

01:25:51.719 --> 01:25:57.639
you who had little who have had Greek right those of you who've had Greek

01:25:57.639 --> 01:26:03.119
you'll notice that it's in the plural right you you say how can it be

01:26:03.119 --> 01:26:09.000
talking about media's vagina where the star is how can it be talking about that

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.520
because look at the colloquial expression look at B the CPO

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:23.000
tasteas are the sinuses the sides of the what is in the

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.960
vagina right they considered it a plurality oh

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:37.400
wow okay well that kind of makes sense and that explains why our famous Roman

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:44.239
author guas valious flacas is telling us that media is taking the drug from her

01:26:44.239 --> 01:26:49.800
vagina when she gives it to

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:58.000
Jason to make him Adamas invol vulnerable do you see e do you see the

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.080

01:30:01.679 --> 01:30:08.480
universe where everybody worshiped um a dude who was arrested in a public park

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:16.679

with a naked kid what do I do with it how am I going to reconcile who Jesus is

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:37.159
in the text and who I believe he is that's a difficulty it's a really

01:30:37.159 --> 01:30:44.480
difficulty how am I going to come to grips with the fact that Moses is a creation of the third Century of a a

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:52.080
branch of a satanic cult that was uh perpetuating an oracular tradition yeah

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:59.280
how do I come to how do I come I don't know maybe it's too soon for the monis to find out that they are
