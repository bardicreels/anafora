00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.240
is unlearned not going to be euphonic what is that mean euphonic this sounds like

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:15.320
one of those crazy Greek ideas um if you look up FR FR you're gonna find

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:21.760
something like mind you're gonna find something like the power to judge

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:27.880
capacitate oh God it's all over the place because there's like 50 words from mind and you don't know which is which

sebas you are without sebo what is the Greek verb Sabo what does it really mean

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:24.360
first of all it's usually in the in the middle voice the older form is active people who are taking Greek will love

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:30.480
this it's um commonly in the middle voice sebomi right but the older form

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:36.399
SEO isn't active so you have to think of it what does it actually mean and you'll

00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:41.919
find when you look it up it's the opposite are you ready for this what

00:30:41.919 --> 00:30:47.679
what do I do when I sebo it's the opposite of what I do when I

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:54.679
hito when I huis someone wait and you're you put your calculator your Can you

00:30:54.679 --> 00:31:00.000

hubris when I punch you in the face if I walk up to you in public and punch you

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:19.080
in the mouth that's huus I can be charged with that it's an assault we would call it it's huus what is the

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:26.360
polar opposite in the Greek mind of the assault it's not to take something like

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:32.519
your freedom with a punch that's that's how they put it to take away your freedom by putting my hands on you it's

00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:41.399
not that it's not that no it's the opposite it is to give reverence to

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:47.360
extend recognition right to extend an honor is

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:55.720

00:39:50.599 --> 00:39:57.920

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:10.079
sisters of frustration where are you people I'm really disappointed here

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:15.119
somebody raised the objection will you that we're talking about teenage girls

00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:22.839
will you please now for those of you who've been following Jesus um with the naked boy in

00:40:22.839 --> 00:40:29.119
the uh public parking for him um some of you have been following that remember

00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:36.800
we're talking about the Nanos well the next stage up from the boy or girl is that

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:45.079
developing um entity right and that thing is the i i is the um nanas again

00:40:45.079 --> 00:40:51.480
you can translate that as as young boy or boy or um some people will even use

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:58.720
young young man right well he's hanging out with the young girls

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:06.240

does this does this Divinity ever get it no it's messing up again that is what

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.839
monism does that's what monism does it's on a

00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:33.960
track for self obliteration oh yes yes because when you

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:39.720

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:14.119
not going to be able to find a cure by means of the drugs and neither

00:46:14.119 --> 00:46:20.400
are the drugs right G to be able to be lived by without you can't live without

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:32.240
these drugs you can't have your frame yeah it's a system that perpetuates your

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:37.559
frin oh again somebody told me just today they were like I don't I don't

00:46:37.559 --> 00:46:43.839

00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:51.640
know it's way out there yes guess what guess what the more you do the more you

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:57.760
do the more you're going to understand how dumb you are do you know how many

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:03.640
years I've spent recognizing on a regular basis how inadequate I am how

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:11.079
dumb I am do you know what I've done I've hung around with a bunch of really really really smart dead people and they

00:47:11.079 --> 00:47:17.040
didn't get there um by birth they got there by

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:24.240
language oh oh god mother Greek you are so sexy I

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:29.880
want to go to all the depths of mother Greek mind I want to find where she is

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:34.960
oh God you're not going to Let's dig let's dig in let's dig in shy um look at

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:42.800
this people I'm giving you a Greek phrase and this is a drug that will set your mind are you ready you're like what

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:46.920
yeah okay ready what's it

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:56.599
sayos now for my Greek students you know the verb to be is tucked in there and you don't necessarily need that right

00:47:56.599 --> 00:48:04.160
that can be invisible it's just in the present no problem um look at what we have Faron and logos either of those

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:11.800
either of those you can make your subject right so usually this is translated as

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:16.640
reason is the drug of the sick

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:24.720
Soul reason is the remedy of the sick soul but watch what mother Greek does

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:29.160
watch what mother Greek does the is

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:37.319
also drugs are the

00:48:37.319 --> 00:48:44.839
reasoning of the suffering mind that Throne that you're sitting on

00:48:44.839 --> 00:48:50.599
is a pharmacon do you understand the

00:48:50.599 --> 00:48:56.480
philosophy of scua right this is that embedded that

00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:04.200
deep philosophy that that logos which is your what it is your Reckoning man it is that

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:10.799
SP it is the spark of your very frin that's what the logos is what do

00:49:10.799 --> 00:49:16.920
