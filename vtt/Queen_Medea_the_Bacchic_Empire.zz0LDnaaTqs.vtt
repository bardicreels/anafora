00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.680
everything starts with an expedition of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.979
Greeks from thessally

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.680
diadoris tells us this Expedition

the peninsula We Now call Crimea

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.099
diadoris tells us those Greeks were

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.720
unaware of the extreme behavior of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.680
locals The Barbarians that live in that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.980
land have a law

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.860
they sacrifice to Artemis tauropolis

leader of the taurians diadoris tells us

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.739
Helios

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.500
had two sons

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.159

the ruler of the taurians both of them

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.420
were known for their cruelty

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.700
children of Helios were marked by

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.760
specific features

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.319
including hair

that bore The Shining Mark of Helios

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.459
their culture was driven by drugs and

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.180
the drug trade their arrows were their

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.540
defense tipped with poisons that gave

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.379
the towerians and the caulkians a

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.280
distinct military Advantage descendants

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.280
of horse cultures

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.799
these people ultimately dominated the

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.260
Black Sea as pirates

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.840
[Music]

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.040
one need only to Sail by the great tower

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.000
of Medea when one entered into the Black

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.440
Sea to know that the region was theirs

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.300
the region belonged

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.620
to the daughters of Helios

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.440
diadoris tells us that Perseus had a

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.160
daughter named Hecate she excelled her

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.880
father and courage in a disdain

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.360
custom she was a Huntress who worked

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.080
with black hounds and when she was not

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.180
hunting wild beasts she hunted men

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.660
instead she was a lover of the skill of

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.740
crafting death bringing drugs she

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.400
discovered aconite and she tested out

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.259
its powers upon people captured people

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.160
who were administered the drug

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.800
hecatee eventually used these drugs to

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.580
kill her own father and to assume power

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.300
over the kingdom when she Rose to power

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.419
she established this practice of killing

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.320
strangers who happen to be washed ashore

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.860
and for this she garnered a great

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.960
reputation of Cruelty

00:05:51.800 --> 00:06:00.240
[Music]

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.340
some time later

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.080
hackity cohabited with eet's and

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.699
produced two daughters Cersei and Medea

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.479
they also had a son Cersei had an innate

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.520
propensity

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.780
for pharmacological experimentation and

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.660
she discovered the powers

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.340
of many drugs unbelievable Powers she

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.979
learned a lot from her mother Hecate but

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.539
what's more

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:36.960
she learned even more through her own

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.800
skill diadoris tells us that Cersei was

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.380
given to marriage to a King of the

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.319
salamations some people he says call

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.960
these people scythians we know that

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.460
Medea had her own bodyguard 12 of these

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.020
scythian women skilled in drug knowledge

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.840
but Cersei killed off the king of the

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.259
sorrowmations with drugs assumed control

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:07.860
of the kingdom and did many bad and

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.280
cruel things for which she was exiled

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.259
from the kingdom according to the

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:17.520
mythographers she fled to the ocean to a

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.759
deserted island and took with her to

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:23.759
that place all the women who followed

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:27.300
her some people say she came to Italy to

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.099
the very place we call today kirkayan

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:35.640
foreign

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:49.500
[Music]

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.460
it was there on that island

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.919
that she met Odysseus

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:59.039
she poisoned him and his men he was

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:02.400
given an antidote against her drugs by

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.220
the God Hermes

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.099
disguised as a young boy diadoris tells

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:10.979
us that Medea learned the art of drugs

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:14.520
from both her mother hecatee and her

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.280
sister Cersei but he adds

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.840
that Medea did not have the same intent

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.240
as they did she was not cruel instead

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.699
she tried to rescue strangers who'd been

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:31.620
taken captive

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.440
sometimes she asked her father directly

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.620
to be merciful to the ones who were

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.320
about to be put to death to give them

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.320
salvation

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.020
sometimes she arranged to have them

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.720
released herself

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.440
it may be that her father eats was the

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.140
source of Cruelty

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.200
but it also may be that her mother was

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.600
the one who would establish the right to

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.080
kill strangers and therefore influenced

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.080
eet's

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.959
regardless of what the mythographers or

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:15.180
historians argue

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.300
it's well known that Medea went on

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.800
to be the healer of the family to be the

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.320
one to spread the healing rights that

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.640
she herself would develop based upon the

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.980
pharmacological cures that she had

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.940
studied with her mother and sister Medea

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.140
used the wisdom that had been stored

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.380
in the activities of the family of the

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.100
Sun

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.620
for Generations

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.320
she used that wisdom in order to create

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.080
a mystery right that would rule the

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.400
world

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.140
[Music]

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:05.640
this princess who would become queen of

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.399
a people in history

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:12.360
this princess was the origin of the

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.980
bakic right

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.459
the very maddening mystery

00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:20.940
that would sweep from east to west in

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.360
the Bronze Age The Very mystery whose

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.080
decline would bring Darkness to the

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.660
world

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.019
Medea discovered the right and an entire

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:38.339
group of people once called Aryans would

00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:42.240
change their name to match the power of

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:48.440
hers they called themselves the medes

00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:53.540
diadoris the Sicilian

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.860
preserved for us that very right in the

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:04.019
first recorded mystery Medea is the

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:08.700
Christ and diadoris brings us to that

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.820
place where we can see the performance

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.060
it was this

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.720
late Bronze Age right that would be

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.320
corrupted as early as its first

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:27.720
generation by a man named Heracles many

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.860
others would develop corrupted forms of

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.200
this medic right

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.180
such as Moses

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.860
and Jesus but this right began with a

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.120
woman

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.839
this right began in a place that was

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:49.260
administered by a woman

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.480
this right

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.000
became the basis

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.160
of all of civilizations religious

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.320
inclinations she

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.680
is the first Christ

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.160
[Music]

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.320
and this

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.380
is diadoris's description

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:18.360
of her initiation this right begins with

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.019
the creation of an image

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:27.540
it is true idolatry and about this queen

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.100
who invented fumigation

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.760
Diadora says Medea made

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.800
an empty image of the goddess Artemis

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:45.120
she then filled it with drugs of all

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:51.079
capacities next she christed herself

00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:56.700
making her hair gray and her skin

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.100
wrinkled

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.700
her appearance was such that anyone who

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.459
saw her would think that she was an old

00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:08.160
woman and then

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.079
picking up

00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:15.360
this mystery initiation image and she

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.139
carried it into the city where the

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:20.040
