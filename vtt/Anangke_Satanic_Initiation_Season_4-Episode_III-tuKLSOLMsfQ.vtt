00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.360
remember these are the things that Paul the Apostle didn't want you to read these are the things that Paul didn't

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.120
want he had no taste for this right he had no taste we're going to be looking at some drugs

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.599
tonight we're going to be looking at some sexual activity um because we're going back into the

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.300
cult we're going to see these things historically

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.879
throw the ship in gear in order to put your mind into the place that we really

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.099
need to go to I want you to be thinking about the vocalizations that are

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.140
happening if you and I are sitting here from our Throne right from the throne we

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.800
can see everything right from the throne we're looking at this

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.379
initiation we need to hear some of the voices we need to hear some of what is

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:12.000
what is being sung in the back we need to hear the Hallelujah did you know that

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.400
Tim Hallelujah was stolen it's a stolen term yes it is it comes from this

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.900
initiation you kind of see it those of you who can smell Bacchus you feel that feel that in the air a little

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.959
bit of Bacchus in the air right of course of course because we honor the muses

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.099
and how a group of people can possibly figure out anything without knowing the

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.980
language of the people they study that's beyond me it's beyond me I just

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.739
want to give a shout out to the people working on linear a as a

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.680
student of Emmett Bennett yeah yeah too slow

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.560
too slow get your act together every one of your grad students should be cracking

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.420
that thing that's what you guys should be working on sorry that was uh

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.920
unfortunate necessity you know I was asking the Watchers and

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.880
they were like well that's why we go there right it's because you're not going to be able to enter into that

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.540
place with Eve unless you come to your dimension I was like well I get it I see that I

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:35.160
see the draw I see the draw I do let's go right there now if you're somebody

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.340
great once said I don't remember who it was but somebody great once said

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.540
a religion that does not have a mother God

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.360
is a destructive religion and I thought about that as I made it up

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.639
and I thought it's consistent with what I've seen

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:06.960
yes fantastic tonight I want you to hear the mother goddess sit on that Throne I

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.600

I want you to see I want you to begin to put together and we're looking at the burning purple tonight so I want us to

want you to see ego Amy sumplanos on that third line down who meant Oster I

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:20.099
am the wandering star with you that the line that follows this is sige Siege

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:27.000
silence silence and it has a little logos in parentheses because this is the

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.660
direction remember we've brought our daughter here and she is being initiated

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:39.300
so what is this initiation about for our daughter what happens she's being

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.400
instructed she's being instructed to remember he told us yes see the drugs

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:51.360

and from the depths I shine again this

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:29.340
is what that girl is being initiated into she is the wandering star

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:37.979
and from the depths she shines again she brings back that light she brings

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:46.580
back that Radiance right it's no wonder the luciferians and all the Bringers of dawn

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:54.740

name it's an epithetic he's Constantine born in the purple [Music]

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:19.440
yeah he has this manual put together right can you believe nobody reads this

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:26.700
stuff it's amazing you know why because people have called it a farming manual and who wants to breed a farming manual

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:32.220
right I read Cato that bored me to death right it's got lots of good information

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:52.620
just want to read you a a passage about a woman and I want you to see a few terms that

00:10:52.620 --> 00:11:01.079
are associated with this cult thing that we're watching unfold the forest this mystery religion yes I fear for them if

00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:07.320
you're I know I shouldn't I shouldn't but I fear for them I'm gonna read this to you it's a little

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:14.040
unwieldy this was a nobody has this by the way I have not seen an English translation of this thing right this is

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:21.120
the English this is the geoponica there we go this is the geoponica and it is

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:27.860
um it is perhaps the best kept secret why because it's composed of a whole

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:34.560
plenitude of authors from Antiquity that we don't any uh we don't have sources

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.959
for any longer right this is where we find them quoted in this thing and

00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:46.140
they're all huge into drugs there's so much drugs and medicine and magic in

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:51.720
this thing it's it's it's unbelievable it's unbelievable okay let me get set up

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.319
here give me a sec

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:12.779
I want to read to you from the geoponica and I'm just gonna let Chewie keep that

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:20.100
up for a second so people can see the Greeks to start with but I want you to start feeding them images okay I want

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:27.060
you to start feeding him images as we go so we can all keep up foreign

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:40.560
this action is an inquiry into Violet The Violet yes that you know

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:47.519
um flowering plant yes we're looking at different plants that can well give you

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:57.480
certain things that can do certain things you know things to interact with the violet derives its name from her

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:05.519
from EO or IO isn't that nice isn't that nice and why

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:12.839
is that because Zeus was in love with ayo and being in love

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:20.660
he coupled he formed a pair he formed a pair

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:26.459
and in an attempt to prevent

00:13:26.459 --> 00:13:32.040
Hera from seeing to prevent any sort of proof

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.380
against him he created

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.800
an alteration of nature itself

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:52.519
yes what did he do how did he make this alteration when he was spotted

00:13:53.339 --> 00:13:58.760
he hid what was produced

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:07.740
he disguised it yes he disguised it and he changed a woman

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:16.320
into a cow yeah and that transformation

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:23.820
that was an alteration of foosis working directly with that nature

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.920
right he's in that Garden that's why Eve is there right it's that

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.620
cry that shout there he is changing look at him he's what what is he doing he's

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:42.240
changing her for those of you who are my Greek students it uses anthropon right but it

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:49.980
uses a definite article that's feminine before it right we haven't seen that but you know what that means right that's

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:58.380
nice he made a human who was female into a cow fantastic fantastic in the Earth

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:04.079
honored the Beloved of God the Earth honored the

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:11.100
Beloved of God yes that

00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:20.839
power the Earth put into making that flower

00:15:20.839 --> 00:15:27.920
that is the portion that is the nemesis

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.959
of that cow the Nemesis that cows

00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:40.920
Nemesis what is that what is that the thing that was produced they called that

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.860
which comes from her and through her

00:15:46.339 --> 00:15:53.060
we are initiating into the mystery

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:59.519
through what comes from her and through her

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:06.120
yeah does that sound familiar to anyone if you've been living in a mystery

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:13.079
religion if you've been living in the perhaps if it's not an active one you

00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:19.380
know because they don't do the same things they used to right um this thing that you're watching this performance that you're watching this

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:27.899
initiation they don't they don't do this anymore right as soon as as soon as we see the

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:34.620
depths to which you have to go and come back from and turn around and

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:40.860
come back from you know that we don't produce the mystery that ours is a is it

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:49.139
just a like an eggshell casing of what once used to be a mystery that egg broke it

00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:57.660
was in a Space Capsule right fantastic this is necessity

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:04.140

them sitting around you have bows because this is a bow arrow poison using

00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:24.840
culture these are the people who are building the civilization that was so far ahead

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:30.299
that was set so far behind when the mystery was corrupted

00:20:30.299 --> 00:20:38.240
by multiple people which we have multiple arrest warrants for I know some of you you've been talking about Jesus's

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:45.120

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:09.120
right yeah but

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:15.360

some commoner can't be a receptacle for vision how dare you

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:18.360
how dare you that's the attitude that I expect from academics that's why they're

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.520
completely useless why you're not listening to evidence you're not looking at things like we're looking at you're

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.220
just you're sitting there listening to their stupid ideas right I'm so mad I've got to be careful

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:27.120
she honored that virgin right you remember simile and Dionysus right that

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:33.960
oracular power is always honoring to that beloved of

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:40.279
Zeus right those lovers who are

00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:46.559
transformed by Zeus right they who have their Natures

00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:52.860

when you have that mystery cup you are able to enter into that erimosis

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:07.100
Jesus went out into the desert

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:13.559

um see the the the culmination for the initiate go

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.059

[Music]

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:46.919
for just like the parthenos in our initiation just like the parthenos

00:32:46.919 --> 00:32:55.380
in the same way that she grows urgent with the reddening

00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:03.419
need with a reddening passion so does the cow

00:33:03.419 --> 00:33:10.200

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:17.580
become profyric says or soar our Byzantine source

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:25.980
so does she become you're looking at the you're looking at that transformation of nature fantastic and

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:33.000
she as she undergoes this transformation shines [Music]

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:40.200
she shines and it is clear from this that the

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:49.320
transformation is a transformation of a girl into a star

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:55.860
of a girl into a star yeah yeah

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:03.960
four here's the kicker are you ready here comes that here comes that Eastern wisdom that's

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:10.440
embedded within the Magi right here comes that Eastern that culky

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.658
and black sea horse riding poison using

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:20.540
wisdom here it is are you ready

00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:34.440
four in whatever the child shines

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:39.118
the woman becomes

00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:46.980
yeah that's nice isn't it in those things that are resplendent

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:52.800
that shine forth that is the formation of the woman

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:58.619
goonie right doesn't use the word for just you know person

00:34:58.619 --> 00:35:07.339
right it uses the worm the word for that person being the one who enters that cry

00:35:07.339 --> 00:35:12.960
that birthing cry right the mother is able to reach into death

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:18.240
this is why you could never have a single God this is why the atheists like

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:24.780
the Christians and the Jews and the Muslims this is why they is atheists because they don't follow the gods they

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:31.619
don't follow nature and they don't follow Justice so you know when you've abandoned the

00:35:31.619 --> 00:35:37.500
gods as an atheist and you only have one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] as your leader

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:42.780
who cannot reach into death and bring from Death life

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:50.640
if you're in a bad you're in a bad circus you're in something that needs to be castrated in DC you're in something that

00:35:50.640 --> 00:36:00.540
needs to be castrated that's how the ma the Maas creates the vision of the

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:05.579
physics surrounding them when you are in that world

00:36:05.579 --> 00:36:13.440
when you're in that world the world of that motherless

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:19.160
existence you're off track and you're on the way to destruction

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:25.440
it's it's how it is and for that we get the Desolation we have to bring the

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:33.720
Desolation for that it's just the it's the cycle it's necessity right it's necessity so bringing back

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:38.880
lady Babylon people ask and I've had some people comment about

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:45.180
um some some hairy magicians I don't know if they're hairy or not but

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:53.400
um some famous ones you know Alistair so and so and you know whatever

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:59.700
um please people the source that we're drinking from is pure and clean I

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:05.520
wouldn't send you out to a to a urine polluted stream and say drink

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:11.040
this is the Water of Life no if you want the Water of Life you

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:18.240
have to go to that pure spring and you you have to honor that virgin if you are

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:26.700
willing to put your daughter into a place where she can become the star and

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:34.079
that woman can be born with everything that that woman is that bringer of life

00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:39.720
yeah if you're able to do that if you're able to put um

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:46.140
an emphasis an energy into that process you know you're a pagan and you've

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:51.660
broken out of the world of that of that man now remember though for those of you

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:57.660
want to give Jehovah a hard time um and say well you know

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:04.320
um you know he's you know he didn't want them to mess up it was just you know

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.420
their fault remember it's the first lie that's told by him because when you take

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:15.359
that fruit your eyes are opened you don't die right the death is part of it

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:23.700
right he's being deceptive death is part of it you enter death but they bring you back and when you come back

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:29.220
your eyes are opened and you are naked

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:34.260
yeah do you know the greatest thing the devil did the greatest thing the devil

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:40.260
did was telling Eve no you can you'll live right he just doesn't want you to have a

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:45.540
knowledge that's all he just doesn't want you to know that to be aware of that

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:52.260
right that is what you end up with with a Jehovah you or a Jesus you end up with

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:58.560
somebody who needs to bend it needs to bend the way pagans don't go there

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:04.740
because the nature corrects them the nature keeps them okay I'm sorry I'm

all of the purple you cannot take any pathway with a purple without coming

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:06.480

about orphism is coming through that ferocities and he is the one who is

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:10.800
bringing us back to Medea yeah fantastic right this is this is oh

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:17.880
God we love it next let's go to the next um who is here's another one with the eel through Isla look at this she's the

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:24.240
talks of four look at that first word she's the toxic Force she's the one who carries that poison bow

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:29.900
yeah that poison bow she's the one who pours out the poison hey use

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:35.579
yeah oh God she's that terrible one right she's that frightful one she's the

00:42:35.579 --> 00:42:41.780
one with the you know little kill you with her bolts yeah

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:49.320
the poison poorer that's how I like to translate that one um go to the next one yeah and who is

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:55.260
EOP Sophos we couldn't do Artemis right without doing Apollo they're twins right

00:42:55.260 --> 00:43:01.500
we're talking about medical Cults here that were bringing our daughters to so here is

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:10.680
um they tell us look it's the it's the eupc Foss this is actually from the safe for us the pebble or stone it's also a

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:17.940
thing that's used in uh throwing dice right coming up with sortes it's a it's

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:23.819
a randomizer and remember according to the Etruscans there is no chance right

00:43:23.819 --> 00:43:29.040
2K is chance is

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:35.520
um adrastea is necessity yeah think about that for a minute some

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:42.660
well I know a lot of you are really smart and educated and um I know that a lot of your

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:50.160
professionals um those of you who are mathematicians think about that there's no random uh

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:56.760
concept of randomization in the Etruscan system that supports

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:04.619
remember one of these great atrocan Queens one is great tyrinian Queens he's probably from this pulaskian line is

00:44:04.619 --> 00:44:11.460
ruling these people named and we call one of our drugs after her

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:18.119
right we call our drug the cerseien right have you taken the cerseien well

00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:24.359
you know I got to do this and I gotta do that right yes so

00:44:24.359 --> 00:44:29.760
um that purple is coming through these people and those people those Etruscans are saying um

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:38.339
there is no such thing as chance mathematically it doesn't exist yeah ananke exists you say what can we

00:44:38.339 --> 00:44:46.740
put in the place of chance ananke and ananke is ordered which is why I think the guys at MIT are finding order amidst

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:53.819
the chaos [Laughter] they're doing can you believe they're doing that right now it's exciting it's

00:44:53.819 --> 00:44:59.099
exciting those nerds are hilarious you gotta you gotta give those nerds over to

00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:04.380
Aphrodite they'll do anything um let's go down to the next one

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:10.500
they think they're they think they're with it anyway look what look what happens to her this is what we say

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:16.200
happens to the um to the Violet right in her

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:23.099
transformation she turns into um this irritation this provocation and

00:45:23.099 --> 00:45:30.560
notice how the victorians very cleverly gave us the last definition at the bottom and said perverseness

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:37.079
perverseness so is this thing yeah it's about flushing with blood

00:45:37.079 --> 00:45:42.599
yeah it's about becoming irate

00:45:42.599 --> 00:45:48.300
and you think well that's weird have you ever seen a cow I get to tell my cow story now I'm going to go ahead and tell

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:53.460
it I don't care I'm getting old um my Caster is I was taking care of

00:45:53.460 --> 00:46:01.380
cows Dairy right doing milking stuff and one night one of them chased me down and like violently assaulted me and I'm

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:07.440
lucky to get away I'm lucky to get away with uh with my health but she was you

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:14.280
know I don't blame her because she was an asterisk and she had been sitting out she had

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:21.420
been sitting out in this one area for a long time you take the cows that are an estrogena and you quarant you put them

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:27.599
in a different pen right and um so we had them out because you have to breed them and they know you're coming right

00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:32.940
they know you're going to be out there to breed them when they're in estrus so she was an actress and she got through

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:39.359
her Corral came over to me and knocked me over and pushed me up against the wall and I was yeah but um she did it

00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:45.660
out of love foreign and when she was doing it I'll never

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:52.700
forget the bellowing I'll never forget that earthy groaning

00:46:52.700 --> 00:47:01.619
passionate compulsion to mating to Aphrodite everything leads to that

00:47:01.619 --> 00:47:07.079
aphrodite we can't have the world Christianity is

00:47:07.079 --> 00:47:15.300
the enemy of Aphrodite they do not worship the gods they are atheists

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:20.520
they do not worship the Gods that is why you do not consider

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:26.839
sexuality to be a Divine Act well I don't know maybe

00:47:26.839 --> 00:47:33.839
maybe some people recognize their sexual Divinity

00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:42.000
um but in Antiquity we're talking about a ritual in which sexuality plays A Part

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.119
so and it's impossible for us to get there without the drugs that we're

00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:53.880
harvesting within the sexual practices you cannot have early Christianity went

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:59.579
hand in hand with sex right hand in hand with sex we know their Agape feasts were

00:47:59.579 --> 00:48:05.040
being broken up for having mothers and sons have sex together

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:10.079
um we know that people were fellating the male member who was the leader of

00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:16.020
the theosus they would have called it on the Greek side yeah

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:21.900
coven if you'd like Christian coven right and we know that the O fights

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:27.599
because they carried the symbol of the serpent we know that they were were told

00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:33.359
by the Christians who who didn't want to accept them the heresyologists who

00:48:33.359 --> 00:48:39.480
established an Orthodoxy we know that they ate semen

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:45.119
yeah right right so when a Christian fellates

00:48:45.119 --> 00:48:53.400
his pastor um it it is after they've invited everybody into the Agape feast and then

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:59.940
they say it's a it's probably a ritual expression but it says they kick over the lamps now I don't know if they

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:07.740
actually kick stuff over around I mean who knows but they turn everything off they turn the light sources off and

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:14.579
um then because they Stripped by that point they just mingle and the problem was the Romans were saying whoa whoa

00:49:14.579 --> 00:49:19.920
whoa you know your orgies are fine we got orgies all over the place we don't

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:27.420
we're not concerned about your orgy right it's the fact that you're not discriminating man this is not you can't

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:33.060
have an orgy with a mother and a son right that's just no no you just can't

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:38.460
do that so you know hey it was because the Christians were born within the Roman

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:43.980
Empire they had to follow by the Roman Empire's cultural notes that stuff was better off

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:49.260
you're better off an Asia Minor right you'd get away with that right you get

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:56.099
away with that in parts of Greece as well you know but you can't you mind our euthrations could get away with it right

00:49:56.099 --> 00:50:01.680
but you're not going to get away with it in Rome so when the Romans are breaking up

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:07.440
the Christian assemblies where the mothers and the sons are having sex together you know

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:14.220
um you know it's just the Hops giving a jump for us to go to Alexandria and arrest all the Pirates right and Origins

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:19.859
like I gotta cut my penis off right it's doing that and all that kind of stuff

00:50:19.859 --> 00:50:25.680
yeah it's a crazy time okay um I want to pull us back I meant to get

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:32.520
there through the Violet right and I need to show us a couple more wait I haven't hit my climax yet for the

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:37.859
for the talk bring that bring bring that up more Greek bloodus oh look this is

00:50:37.859 --> 00:50:44.880
Tiny so I'm gonna have to look really close so I don't mean to be like weird or anything as if you know because I'm a

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:50.940
pretty normal guy but I'm gonna go ahead and read this look uh just you're gonna have to look into

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:57.839
my eyes I don't care I have by the way in my eyes I have I have dead people you

00:50:57.839 --> 00:51:06.240
know look at no look at my eyes can you see the can you see the universe they used to take me in for the at the

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:13.200
hospital to show the medical students because I have a what looks like a solar

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:20.400
system in both of my uh eyes right and it's a corneal thing it's a corneal

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:26.700
thing right but um anyway so I'm a little bit self-conscious I'm sorry that's why I don't like to get up close

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:31.819
um my students used to say don't look into his eyes

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:37.920
can you believe that they loves me though okay and at these most look at

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:44.819
this what is this thing that she enters into um that Violet enters into right that IO

00:51:44.819 --> 00:51:50.520
enters into it's the edithismos right that which is called WEA this is that

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:58.500
fly this is that gadfly it's the Mania afrodicion and you hear the afro dicion

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:05.460
you know Aphrodite's in there this is the Mania of the aphrodisiacs

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:10.800
and you just discovered a whole new religion you just discovered a whole new

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:16.140
religion we have aphrodisiacs that will induce an

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:23.640
oracular Mania yeah priestesses of Aphrodite

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:29.339
are the ones that are dealing them and using them and that's why that's why

00:52:29.339 --> 00:52:35.640
it's suspicious when these fairy drugs end up in Mary magdalene's hands

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:41.220
yeah the pro pardons or don't worry um fantastic what else does it cause it

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:46.380
causes a porosis this is a porosis this thing entering this phase it's a heating

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:52.559
it's a burning it is Lissa it is listen do you know what Lissa is

00:52:52.559 --> 00:52:57.599
blissa is Mania Melissa is what you get when a rabid dog

00:52:57.599 --> 00:53:03.059
bites you you get that Mania you get that Mania do you want to put

00:53:03.059 --> 00:53:08.220
this on you can put this Mania on imagine yourself

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:15.420
under the influence of the mania-inducing aphrodisiacs

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:21.599
yeah you're gonna come out naked but your eyes are gonna be open

00:53:21.599 --> 00:53:28.200
your eyes are going to be more open than they've ever been this is what Jehovah

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:35.040
doesn't want you to have but Eve you can have it

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:41.700
I'll give it to you you know he left me in charge wow I'm not going to keep you from it

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:48.059
all right remember the devil is the best looking of everyone right and the

00:53:48.059 --> 00:53:54.000
smartest so I don't know maybe Jehovah you know

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.040
he's just thick bro Joe is just thick you know he's kind of gangsterous and

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:04.500
he's just thick and he's got a problem with women right it's not a sacrifice not to

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:12.900
mention this Human Sacrifice stuff what you know it's just not it just doesn't cut it brah your profits oh God right

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:20.099
they got no mother they got no mother when the abomination of desolation sits

00:54:20.099 --> 00:54:25.200
in that Inner Space you'll know run let's see okay this is gorgeous last

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:30.660
um yeah and it has the oh it has a form of wings nobody ever believes me until they actually see the evidence but

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:37.319
remember I told you guys the stuff makes you fly right this is where she's going this is

00:54:37.319 --> 00:54:43.140
where the Korra is going it's flying

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:49.140
wow wow and it causes the cattle that are

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:55.859
struck by it it causes them to steer toss and they still tosin what is those

00:54:55.859 --> 00:55:03.359
of you or my students who are reading the Buckeye right now right and you'll say oh wait a minute that verb is used that's what the Bakken

00:55:03.359 --> 00:55:08.520
does the Bakken enters that what does it mean to skirto it means to jump around

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:13.760
and frolic like a young animal in Spring

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:20.760
Frolic this is what the drug caused you to do okay imagine a group of 100 women

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:30.900
under the influence of this drug with weapons yeah imagine what Unholy Beauty could we

00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:37.380
possibly could we possibly bring that would outshine that right as the

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:44.220
girl shines so becomes the woman right what does that mean what does that

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:49.980
mean you'd never hear a Christian today Evangelical Catholic I don't care you

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:55.200
would never hear a Christian pondering as goes

00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:02.460
The Shining child as the child shines through the woman is born right

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:08.280
right it's gorgeous and it's all based on that fruit and

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:14.220
bringing her out bringing out Eve people say can you reproduce the Mysteries

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.280
um

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:25.619
could but we're all scientists here we don't care about your beliefs

00:56:25.619 --> 00:56:31.619
we're scientists and if you could reproduce the mystery you'd have to end up with the same product

00:56:31.619 --> 00:56:40.020
you'd have to end up with Eve right can we bring back Eve isn't that funny

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:48.119
that that is what the question comes to in history and we can stand back and we say no to Joan of Arc we can say now

00:56:48.119 --> 00:56:53.180
your Visions are from the Devil right

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:59.460
we can stifle it you can stifle Aphrodite all you want she'll break through that's why all your preachers

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:04.619
and Priests are in sex scandals right because this is Satan's realm and

00:57:04.619 --> 00:57:10.020
Aphrodite is in charge brah Aphrodite is in charge you don't get I know I just

00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:17.160
want to talk to you to the Evangelical women who are out there right

00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:22.980
you cannot overcome necessity you will want

00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:28.559
you will want to express the voice of Eve you want to

00:57:28.559 --> 00:57:36.119
yeah why because it's the beauty of nature man it's the beauty of nature

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:41.760
these people that were reading you these texts from these people understand it

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:48.000
and they know the drug connection so next time some scholar comes to you and

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.040
