00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.360
I'm going to go through it twice I'm not going to say anything

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.439
start with enjoy hit it chewy how old was she how old was she when she had Jesus so the Christian Scholars say they

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:53.439
if they all say that unanimously she was probably around the age of 12 12 right when the when the father based on

00:03:53.439 --> 00:04:01.400
Christianity placed Christ into her womb MH which is fine that's past the age of

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.280
puberty in 99% of the times right so she was of childbearing age at the age of 12

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.720
where am I going with all this yeah where you going with this first of all anyone that marries a 10-year-old today should be hung okay I'm not saying it's

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.959
right but in context the rule of the whole world was

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.800
once a woman had her period She was of the age she could bear children that's just nature they didn't keep track with

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.199
records and this and that the ancient Arabs and was known as the time of ignorance reason that human beings have

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:39.240
reason that we can come up that we are able to believe in God do you believe in the higher power who do you believe

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.759
there's a God I don't know you really don't know I don't know so you don't take a stance I'm not saying denomination do you believe this is

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:53.440
thunder up there right be careful for this office get sh the last time there was Thunder up there was when a guy was in here saying hail Satan to us that guy

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:02.639
yeah that guy yeah that guy yeah that guy gu fantastic do you see

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.039
how we inserted ourselves right in the middle of that we were all sitting there

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:14.320
watching them while they're interviewing isn't it gorgeous oh God it's fantastic

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.880
now you all seriousness um one of the points this

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:29.960
gentleman made needs to be looked at and that is the age of the wife of Muhammad

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.880
the age of Mary and uh um what exactly is that oh

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.759
we're talking as they mentioned this is in the Proto

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:49.400
Evangelion of James if you want to drag quote second century bra this is the

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.919
early stuff says Mary was 12 when she got

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:00.000
pregnant in the temple and they auctioned her off

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.039
purple fingered Mary fantastic fantastic okay so I

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:14.960
wanted you to notice I wanted you to notice a couple of

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:22.599
things it is unacceptable to consider a person who

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:32.080
is aggressing a minor who is 10 to 12 that is wrong that was made apparent

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:39.639
truly clear thank you however in this fantasy

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:46.560
world that this gentleman conjured oh and all in all of the

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.000
ancient Realms in all of the ancient Realms it's

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.720
when a girl started having her period that they married her off whenever

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.919
somebody REM people whenever somebody generalizes they're bsing to you they're

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:11.840
building you that image of the Greek Nation they're already in the fairy tale

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.039
they're already there which makes perfect sense because this gentleman is a

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:24.960
monest so in our world I want to make sure you see this you and I hail Satan

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.240
stand by reason and reason

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.000
will keep us from this

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.160
digression from reality he's still giving you a fairy tale World it doesn't exist what he's

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.400
talking about right it just doesn't exist but let's look at the age how old

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:54.000
is she how old is she

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.680
yeah Mary we're given a text is 12

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:06.159
Mary so one time that's okay prophet's wife

00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:12.960
can be a 12-year-old okay that's okay now string

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:19.319
them up do you see the

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:28.639
inherent contradiction in all forms of monism ultimately you must deny your own

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:34.279
natural reason right yes 10 to

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:40.159
12 totally off limits undeveloped

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:46.800
unfinished unfamily unus UNS Society un

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.839
civilization Barbarian

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:57.680
yes yes do you see play it again shuy I want you to hit that subtle Rhythm that

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:03.720
the monis gets into pull to pull you in watch go for it how old was she how old

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.800
was she when she had Jesus so the Christian Scholars say they if they all say that unanimously she was probably

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:19.360
around the age of 12 12 right when the when the father based on Christianity placed Christ into her womb mhm which is

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:25.000
fine that's past the age of puberty in 99% of the times right so she was of

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.600
childbearing age at the age of 12 where am I going with all this yeah where you going with this first of all anyone that

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.640
marries a 10-year-old today should be hung okay I'm not saying it's right but

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.959
in context the rule of the whole world was

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:46.839
once a woman had her period She was of the age she could bear children that's just nature they didn't keep track with

00:09:46.839 --> 00:09:53.160
records and this and that the ancient Arabs in what is known as the time of ignorance reason that human beings have

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:59.640
reason that we can come up that we are able to believe in God do you believe in higher power who do you believe this a

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.720
God I don't know you really don't know I don't know so you don't take a stance I'm not saying denomination do you believe there's

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:13.480
Thunder up there right be careful for this office the last time there was Thunder up there was when a guy was in here saying hail Satan to us that guy

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:19.120
yeah that guy yeah

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:25.360
yeah everybody read the body language a failure to maintain eye

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:32.040
contact on eye contact is a sign of extreme fear or

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:40.360
dress you see what we have that they know that we have and can't be taken

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:47.600
away from us is that reason it's why we can afford to be so

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:58.279
devastatingly honest with them when we show them the texts when we show them

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:04.279
the texts you see age of ignorance what was that

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:09.440
JY was that the age of ignorance Seth the set the chronometer for the age of

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.720
ignorance bro right now what's miraculously

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:21.120
stupendous is that this gentleman doesn't know that the people that he's talking

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.240

History I want you to see it through my eyes it's okay because I was given a

00:14:57.639 --> 00:15:06.279
chance to bring to the stage a real black

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:14.000
hole I was given a chance to activate the thing that the stage was meant to do

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.839
it was meant to engage and to burn off your

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:26.399
impurities you mean this DIC worship is is painful you bet

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:30.800

the creation of a new black hole a new event

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:52.040
horizon for us to cross a brief brief

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:58.759
window it was you know that stuff that's hitting the Earth that was part of it

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:06.920
yeah know I found it in John lettuce and I was like oh man and turns out there was a

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:13.720
supernova some kind of right they picked it up three different places right do

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:20.680
you understand the privilege that I was given I got to sit in a

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:27.639
theater having advised on the production of a

00:16:27.639 --> 00:16:33.600
performance that was made meant to purge it was meant to step into the mind

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.440
of the Vier and to pull out all

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.839
that so that we would all be better citizens I had a

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:53.920
contract so I wanted to do it right so in the procession at St Mar's

00:16:53.920 --> 00:17:00.160
University and by the way sold out

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:09.240
completely booked people coming in seeing it for the third time how do I know that

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:17.400
because I got to go to Every performance and I got to sit anonymously in the crowd and I got to hear people whisper

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:25.839
things it was the best performance that St Mary's University had put on period that's what

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:31.400
people were saying people were upset what

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.480
happened at the beginning of the procession of the bakic procession to

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:43.120
the stage we must bring our 8 foot

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:50.000
dildos do you understand so we did we brought them in

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.280
it was fantastic we had a chorus of Furies with dildos ready now these were

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:01.200
not just anything taken out of some kind of movie from from the 70s

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:09.120
no these were replicas of what the

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.400
original fum was supposed to look like we have these things all over the place

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:21.080
Romans are dropping them out of their pockets oops drops my erection and

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:28.880
testicles right knock it put it back up on the door Mary okay Daddy

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:36.280
right no problem the fosin was a tool and so that was brought back to

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:41.760
life it St Mary's it was brought back to life now why did I set up all of this

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:48.559
because I had an understanding and a mission and that

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:54.080
mission was to bring forward the historic

00:18:54.080 --> 00:19:01.080
person that you and I call media and I was doing it through the

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.600
Latin of cica who and why did I choose the Latin

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:13.520
of cica not the Greek of ureides because the Latin of cica was

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:19.600
exposed to the atran religion and this in within the Imperial

undertoe this was crazy this before he had to like stand at his house with shotguns and tell people do not come to

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:24.440
see me for autographs or nothing so you know what the way you present yourself

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:30.679
is lot this stuff you have to understand so the the the guitarist Dude too he worked for a Lucas light and film so he

01:15:30.679 --> 01:15:36.960
had all the techonologies but these guys were heavy into the dope dude you have to

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:43.239
understand like the rock and roll and all this stuff how far how how deep do you need to go Sir Mr Dr Aon thanks

01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:50.040
chewy how far do you need to go we need we need to get to your heart baby you

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:55.560
take us in as deep as we go I'm going to put you on take us in man all the way we

01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:04.638
love it all right so we're at the show I done the asset this is on pork soda so

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:13.800
it's my name is mud and they gave me so much dope that I walk back this is at

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:19.520
Thunderbird Stadium at you University of Victoria or no uh University of British

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:25.480
Columbia out of the West Point and I walked for like five hours hours back

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:31.719
and all I heard was My Name Is Mud with the Baseline but it was so funny because two

01:16:31.719 --> 01:16:41.800
played on the side stage and no one gave a fly nothing about them and then they became bingles W there you go

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:47.239
and it's very interesting to see the Dynamics now because when I look at the rock and roll because I think what

01:16:47.239 --> 01:16:53.760
you're asking is did the girls know were the girls hiring all this dope and was

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:59.800
this what was pushing the music music industry and I think yes is the answer but you got to say no to a lot of things

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:06.400
say no I don't want one I want two next question sir cool cool okay

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.000
here's what I want to ask about your how would you talk about your style because

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:18.520
I have noticed with the albums that you've offered to us just gorgeously

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:23.639
right everybody realize Teddy is not doing this he's not charging me to do

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:28.800
this put these records out no no no no no no no nothing I just do my music it's

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:34.239
all good yeah it makes me ashamed because you're so productive and I'm

01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:41.840
like well I do two shows a week well big deal you're putting out albums all the time it's hard to keep up it's

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:47.480
so so here's here's what I want to ask you um you have different kind of styles

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:54.320
in my own Stupid unmusical Ways um you have different kinds of styles I noticed

01:17:54.320 --> 01:18:01.120
this last time you hit a kind of 70s place for me I was here in like 70s are

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:06.280
you doing this on purpose and tell us a little bit about you know the music that

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:11.440
you make and you're interested in making well thanks sir and yeah so the

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:18.880
70s and we hear that funk style coming through is because I guess when I first grew up like the first memories I had

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:25.920
when I'm four or five years old is listening to like you know flamco and belly dancing music and clubs and stuff

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:33.040
but the funk was always there so you listen to and you listen to Funk and those guys in the 70s I think that's when it was the big height so you talk

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:39.600
about the hot purple and the media and all that stuff it was sort of like the free rain because since 1954 whenever

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:46.320
they did the thing it was just drugs [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] drugs and that's what we're talking about with Rome or whatever the

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:51.400
fact simil of Rome is when they push the Jesus on you but it was the dope and it

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:57.639
was the hot purple and they got the these PE man I took some notes dude and these people were out of the mind dude

01:18:57.639 --> 01:19:03.120
and hey by the way happy Friday the 13th you talk about Jason and media well

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:10.080
isn't Jason the dude in Friday the 13th and he comes through and it's all that horror course style too the MK

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:16.719
man so when you get the hot purple and you got all this dope but the people were tripping out

01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:23.040
because you know the Vatican and the Masons they used all this thing so you got to look because I know you you touch

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.120
Bas with that things a little bit and we won't go too deep into the things to get you all like blockaded and all that

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:34.400
stuff but uh when you when you go to see The Master Mason you'll notice he has

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:39.639
the ring so it's the dude that you bow down to so they are pulling strings and

01:19:39.639 --> 01:19:46.800
this talks about the technology and if if if they knew that the Rome was really the dope and that was just to drug the

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:53.199
people so we go to the frequency of 440 so why do they change the thing from

01:19:53.199 --> 01:19:58.560
432 Hertz to 440 that was to keep you half stepping

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:04.080
keep you in a different thing kind of keep you in transition between notes so you don't really feel what's going on

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:09.679
and that is what because with anonia and medu she she she looked at

01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:14.719
the animals and she were doing she said oh look at the they're getting high she

01:20:14.719 --> 01:20:20.840
said no there's the Frog Juice the snake juice there's all this thing the Scorpion juice and she understood like

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:27.120
Alchemy and and fractional dissol so they would take certain solvents and stuff and say well I just need to get

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.480
this but you got to thin it out a little bit because there too much you can these people will be ping Deuces man and you

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:38.239
know that's what it is because that's the heroin because when they did the the you know the big thing they they turned

01:20:38.239 --> 01:20:43.520
the world out on heroin so go again what's the next question

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:49.320
tell me here's what here's what I need to ask you so they've got all of these

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:55.880
drugs that the B all all these drugs that are meant to kind kind of bring out

01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:03.800
things that are on the inside of you that you know you're you don't normally bring out and for some reason you got to

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:09.560
purge these things tell me is there any in the in your you know in your

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:16.760
repertoire in your in your work as a musician um do you recognize the power

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:24.040
of the drugs to purge and to bring out what's on the inside yes so I'm The Man Who Laughs

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:30.560
because they used to scar people they would cut them and they would deform and they would orphan children so to get

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:37.679
back to why am I all these different things why do I talk about Pennywise and sort of dark Alchemy and

01:21:37.679 --> 01:21:44.560
black magic and appreciate what you're doing so much is because I realized that it

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:50.679
was the drugs they were doing and they're put people

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:07.960
killing the children and and doing the cannibalism and feeding the people back to each other they were feeding the

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:16.120
parasite back to each other this is a way to push the disease forward um are you guys familiar with uh

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:22.400
some real evil [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because you know they boil with the cauldron and stuff and they just twist people up

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:29.600
so real evil [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is satanic initiation man we can't

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:35.239
talk about real eil [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no no that's all part now everybody please not that

01:22:35.239 --> 01:22:41.199
what Teddy's talking about is all part of a group of traditions and rights and

01:22:41.199 --> 01:22:46.280
cult activities that are considered you know we don't talk about those things we

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:53.400
we put those into a closet it's like the eating of the people thing the whole cannibalism right we can't seem to get

01:22:53.400 --> 01:23:00.760
Beyond the cannibalism yet there is something there is something yeah it's

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:07.880
really bad because they fed the people to the pigs and then fed the pigs to the people that's a one-step cannibalism

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:14.960
yeah could you eat could you eat the pigs after you fed them the people and

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:20.360
would it taste different that's what I want to know well they call humans long

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:25.880
Pig in Africa and in other places you know what I mean because so they sort of say like chicken or whatever but you

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:31.320
want to get do it taste like

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:38.400
chicken laugh it does not want you to have fun it does not want you to be happy that is the way so the more you

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:43.560
light this place up the better it is man just L it up yeah yeah let me tell you

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:50.960
something Teddy it's it's been uh such an incredible honor to watch you

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:59.000
compose um I've had the privilege of talking to you a few times about the process and about working the Poetry I

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:07.560
want to ask you a final question um and just let you kind of Riff Off it um tell

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:12.600
me how tell me a little something about you and the

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:19.840
Muse all right me and the Muse yeah so the cat the Muse the animals love me and

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:25.239
it's because you know um like I said they used to sing to me when I was a kid

01:24:25.239 --> 01:24:32.120
so there you go hello you know Ted Teddy my grandmother my grandmother used to

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:37.639
say who had horses all the time she used to say people who don't like children

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:44.119
and animals are bad people do would you agree with that 100% so I'd watch the

01:24:44.119 --> 01:24:49.360
dogs when I was younger because I was a t

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:15.600
bring B back bring both back yeah was it still recording yeah I went straight

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:21.480
yeah no that's okay you got it I hope it didn't drop or nothing like that I just kept rolling because I don't know if the

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:27.119
my feed doesn't die over here so no yeah because you have a good you have a good

01:25:27.119 --> 01:25:32.760
setup that's why no dude you know

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:38.480
I'm with the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] things bamit don't

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:44.800
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all right but the horses and animals so they would watch them and they would ask the

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:51.159
strength and so you got to be down with the animals and stuff so um I would watch the dogs and the dogs would tell

01:25:51.159 --> 01:25:57.400
me if someone had hate in their heart because if a lot of people they just protect and maybe some got the big bucks or whatever but you watch the animals

01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:03.199
and they'll tell you what's really going on so much love to the animals and all that stuff and I like animals more than

01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:08.440
I like people a lot of times because animals don't lie you give them a little bit of food give them a little bit of

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:13.639
loving and the animals are cool and look at that like on the orus album cover do

01:26:13.639 --> 01:26:20.000
you see what the cover is that's orus playing the guitar but he's got the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] her and sringo there and all the

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.800
animals just want to go to him because they know they're like oh he's got the painkiller [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and cuz all the

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:31.040
animals are like but the animals are half High because they eat raw mushrooms and they eat all things but like I got

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:36.600
too much lactic acid and he just comes and all the animals just come down remember when you see an animal with

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:43.320
submission that's because the animal likes you I only had to chase off one black bear so far this year no big deal

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:49.040

carcus put it up there people I see funk I see people also saying more metal more

01:29:19.239 --> 01:29:26.199
Funk yeah metal and Funk can you fuse those two make monk yeah I used to work

01:29:26.199 --> 01:29:31.400
with some dudes like that so you know it's I wear the Burgeria hat do you guys ever listen in Burgeria that's some

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:36.719
crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because they did the song called kristos DEA

01:29:36.719 --> 01:29:43.320
boka misora this is what so it says Jesus sells pure cocaine to the

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:49.280
children with the help of of of you know the marijuana people too and stuff it's

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:55.560
great lyrics you should look it up what's the thing you you brought in

01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:02.520
James Brown can you please tell me um why did James Brown's ghost come to you

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:10.119
okay so James Brown now that's two different things so James is obviously you know a a a a a a a a book in the

01:30:10.119 --> 01:30:18.000
Bible right and James Brown so that's all about the dope and he did the song called The Big Payback so when you go so the thing to

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.560
it was all about so what was The Big Payback and they have to look at what was the vassals of the Catholic Church

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:30.239
through the Jesuits well that was the the the the group that was pushing this

01:30:30.239 --> 01:30:36.679
narrative on you so for me to come back and say it's The Big Payback this is the payback against the pharmaka this is

01:30:36.679 --> 01:30:43.600
metawa because Antonia and I'm I'm I went full Baka I went full back you know

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:50.159
baktria I'm straight out here Ora ccus and I'm just working with the rocks and

01:30:50.159 --> 01:30:57.080
stuff and I'm mix up I got frogs running around mix some stew up and these people don't understand that that's that so I'm

01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:02.440
so close to the North Pole right now that the sun is still shining that's

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:09.679
what the people don't get right so that's what we're doing up but I'm stiring up because the girls that show me this stuff and I looked it up I went

01:31:09.679 --> 01:31:16.239
dis research and that's the worst thing I guess they just Tau me to read and write so if they don't like it too bad

01:31:16.239 --> 01:31:22.679
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's one thing I like about your music Teddy is that it's very heav

01:31:22.679 --> 01:31:28.600
and it's packed and I know that I got to listen to every line and I know that

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:34.040
there's going to be some there that I'm going to miss and I'm going to have to go back and be like what is the exact

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:39.760
connection right and so I love that I um there's a group of that's the that's the

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:44.920
mushrooms and you should always be not afraid to ask me what word am I saying because I don't print them out I don't

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:51.199
like release like things but what I'm saying is actually you know like lyrics or spells and when I talk about circles

01:31:51.199 --> 01:31:58.639
in this is because I understand how they use the magic against you but if you use the magic again you know and and and you

01:31:58.639 --> 01:32:05.159
can neutralize it or you can almost begin because all they don't want you to know is who you are and what you are

01:32:05.159 --> 01:32:10.960
they want you to believe the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and be miserable and all that other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and be a slave to them because the more

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:16.880
they take away from you the more that they gain on you so if you understand anything about what media even did

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:22.440
closely then that means you can free yourself because me you can do drink

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:28.719
some water go just do whatever you want on they bind you and they so like look dude they wanted me to go work at EA

01:32:28.719 --> 01:32:35.320
Sports and do music there right but I knew because the contract that I would not own my publishing and the day I left

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:42.040
there I wouldn't own my copyright or nothing so it was a nice check but it be nothing so look at this it's what dude

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:47.440
you know we're talking Decades of me making music but I never sold my soul [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and that's what we talking about

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:54.000
to do this no one's paying me I just do it but I was maintained the thing where

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:00.639
if pennies are left at my toes then I collect those pennies because those pennies were left at my toes so get that

01:33:00.639 --> 01:33:07.360
right yeah yeah you know what Teddy you know what um that music that you

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:14.080
bring um I just want you to clarify for me I know man you sit down and this

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:21.080
stuff flows and is it just me or is that flow is that connection with The Muse there's

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:27.800
nothing better in the universe is there so that is when so one time I there was

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:34.040
old Japanese guy we'd play Haack and he'd do tai chi and one day I smok enough weed I

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:39.760
could see the wavelength in my hands I could feel it and that was the whole

01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:45.760
energy stuff so just to control it like what you're saying and to to to Rhyme or

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:52.290
to be in dende so that's when you play like the guitar and you're like just doing like you know some

01:33:52.290 --> 01:34:04.350
[Music]

01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:14.239
[Music] and that was just dende so that is all they don't want you to be able to do and

01:34:14.239 --> 01:34:19.560
just to to to understand instruments or anything and that's what they took away from you that's what I was talking about

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:26.239
the 440 Herz so for you to say what do you do to do the wrong rhyme and that's the one too to because I used to go

01:34:26.239 --> 01:34:33.000
watch all the rhymers in the '90s and some of the best rhymers they could just do free style and stuff so sometimes

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:39.760
they just put on a beat a simple beat and the guys just boom boom boom to the beat on the one two so when you learn to

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:45.920
do that but you have a collection because I obviously we study atmology right here which is the study of

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:52.920
syllables through history and that's why the Greek thing is so important to me because I was lied to since I was day

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:59.080
one and they always told me that Hebrew [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and when I went I went and

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:04.960
research and started to learn Hebrew and they're like what would you want to learn Hebrew and I'm like and then I

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:12.520
learned it's the Greek I'm like no it's the Greek and now they're even more mad and that is just the best man because

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:17.960
and now they the same thing because I realized these people come across me they memorize two or three lines
