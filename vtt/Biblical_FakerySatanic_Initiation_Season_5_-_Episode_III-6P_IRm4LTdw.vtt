right and what is she she's walking around our sandals without her shoes on

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:58.740
without her sandals on and she doesn't have her plucked us she doesn't have her

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:04.799
hair braided it's all down and she is full of pain let's go to the next text

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:13.280

right the man is dead and his form his holy form is lost

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:52.559
and then the third line interestingly says

00:22:52.559 --> 00:23:01.740
there is a beautiful form in Cyprus in Aphrodite when Adonis lives but

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:09.600

she loses the morphe she loses that form

00:23:28.679 --> 00:23:35.460
and that Adonis is transferred to the Korah

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:40.919

keeps that mystery alive she will eventually recall him

00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:51.240
she will recall him but she must first remember we're a bunch of cultists in

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:59.159
Antiquity that's who's dancing around she must first place him into death

00:25:59.159 --> 00:26:08.480
he must first enter into death and be subject to the great Korah

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:16.559
when she decides he will return because Aphrodite will

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:24.120

Antiquity that even when Christianity took a hold of the state apparatus it

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:17.159
was still able to penetrate Society this symbol of the Rose

00:29:17.159 --> 00:29:22.919

00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:28.220

medicine let's these are the people we're dealing with right and okay let's keep going just remember these the the

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:56.279

accompany Aphrodite and if you don't understand the hottie taste you cannot understand the mystery

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:29.279
the word hottest is the singular and you'll recognize right away in all

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:36.120
the evangelicals will go what Grace grace and mercy and peace do you

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:41.760

Grace are you kidding these haritays are pictured what is

00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:00.360
Grace in the mind of the ancient world Grace is a beautiful woman

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:06.059
I didn't make this stuff up I don't care where you put it and where your politics are I really don't care Grace is a

00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:13.740
beautiful woman who accompanies she who is loved

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:20.779
wow wow wow okay okay do you see how the how

00:33:20.779 --> 00:33:26.000
woman-centered this all is it's incredibly woman centered and remember

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.120
our goddess poet who's writing this she is a lesbian from Lesbos

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:41.340
right she has female lovers she's a school teacher she's got students ride okay say

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.980
what you want go ahead I can hear him let me hear the complaints let me hear the complaints it wasn't me it was

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:52.500
sappho it was sappho yes and she's fallen in love with a

00:33:52.500 --> 00:34:00.000
student again right so who better to write about the power

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.480
of persuasion and the power of Grace that's the other entity that accompanies

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:13.800
Aphrodite persuasion yeah desire

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:19.200
yeah love it oh wow he met us right that

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:24.560
desire that desire are you getting it and this is from

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.878
women-centered societies all right do you know why we're here

00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:38.220
we're only here because of Diana we're only here because of Diana you mean that poor of poison that archerous

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:44.700
from up on the Black Sea who Madea's walking around and everybody's

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:51.419
calling her diwanasa yeah that's who we're talking about she's the one who's planting this that

00:34:51.419 --> 00:34:56.878
Diana because of her son

00:34:56.879 --> 00:35:02.900
and his disrespect the fact that he was disrespected right

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:08.339
he cursed Aphrodite Diana's son cursed Aphrodite

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:16.500
right wow how is this the Virgin goddess because that hippolysis is that child

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:22.020
she was his leader she was the head Huntress and he was the

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:27.420
follower he was the devotee and when you're in a Bronze Age Society

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:36.780
where women are leaders there's a special relationship with that devotee that is like a mother to her son

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:42.420
and what happens to him he gets killed by Aphrodite he gets killed by Aphrodite do you know

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:47.460
why because he disrespected her and he was Immortal shame on him

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:53.520
right this is Aphrodite aphrodite has the power to do things she

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:59.040
made an entire Island an entire island of women she punished them

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:05.339
for not respecting her this is what happens what happens when you don't respect Aphrodite

00:36:05.339 --> 00:36:12.900
I'm gonna tell you from the text these are the limiting women I'm going to tell you first for all certainty

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:20.339
or text say the lemony and women suddenly became very very smelly

00:36:20.339 --> 00:36:28.320
in places of holiness where rights should be being celebrated

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:34.680
so that they can come to the Hallelujah because the only thing the poet wants is

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:43.200
to find that Hallelujah to drink that Hallelujah from Aphrodite's lips bring

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:49.020

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:48.240
yeah and he's good for it for another 24 hours we'll kill him if we take him much further than that

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.820

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:03.480
but even stronger than the drugs were her songs and that's why the fleece is

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:09.900
an animal skin with the song of the queen written thereon in

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:16.980

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:59.760
somebody wrote to me this week I'll just take a two-minute break with this somebody wrote to me this week I love it

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:07.260
when people do it somebody wrote to me and said hey I'm curious about this thing called the moabite Steely Ryan

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:12.480
what is it and what I don't know I don't know but I looked

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:18.599
it up and it's not even in Hebrew right well it has the name of God it

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:23.640
looks like it's a Venetian and what people say it's there's a chance it's

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.859
fake you mean it's not a did they find this at a dig or didn't they

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:35.220
right well it's been questioned I think it's real now what is it it's not Hebrew

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.078
the point that we're bringing

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:48.119
is always do the research with the evidence don't come up with stupid ideas just present

00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:53.940
the evidence we have no Hebrew you say we have inscriptions yeah most

00:40:53.940 --> 00:41:02.040
of them are one letter that could be scratches as well as a letter there is no Library we are drowning in

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:11.220
the Greek we are drowning in it an atom an Adonis come from this Mycenaean old

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:17.760
Greek old Greek yeah so we're in trouble people the the

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:23.760
reality that we've been presented is not is not there let's go uh let's just go

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:29.359

so good but it does it feels so good okay

00:43:13.619 --> 00:43:20.579
I don't want to get too far away from Jesus because he touches upon the whole Adonai

00:43:20.579 --> 00:43:28.260
business let's look at that quote and so they came to they came to this

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:35.760

they're entering in to that place of mourning it is a right

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:31.859
that very much is centered upon what you and I call death

00:44:31.859 --> 00:44:38.520
and burial the whole experience of death and burial and mourning wrapped up into

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:45.839
a mystery centered around lovers centered around lovers

00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:52.560

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:26.040
Doric wait what yes the worship of Aphrodite and Adonis is Doric

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:31.140
how do we know because the language they're using it's all dork baby they

right he's got all our attributes

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:47.280
right think about that there is a religion right now

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:54.560

00:47:40.859 --> 00:47:47.940
of my righteous indignation against thee God who comes wearing the costume of

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:53.040
Venus in order to Massacre remember David

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:59.160
you can talk about Adonai and Psalms you can talk about Adonai and Psalms and

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:07.079
every time you're going to find a kurios there and that's why the Hebrew Scholars who screwed up said oh

00:48:07.079 --> 00:48:13.079

that was much much older it is a root

00:56:24.839 --> 00:56:30.300
and a concept which comes to us from the very heart of everything mystery

00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:35.819
religion and antiquity it comes to us for the root for

00:56:35.819 --> 00:56:42.420

of her garden yeah the one that would rather die

00:57:42.599 --> 00:57:48.780
for both Orthodox Judaism and Christianity
