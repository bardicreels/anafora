00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:22.020
couple of Clips say a couple of things and uh hone kind of focus where we're

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.280
looking here remember we're searching for lady Babylon and under the right

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.099
circumstances everything can come together

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:52.499
[Music]

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.599
so tonight I want to start off with a couple of clips that we've put together here from Neil's interview with

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:05.519
Anastasia and I want us to look at just responses I just want to see what a

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:13.860
response is as if we're just having tea saying what is this situation and who is this person let's

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.019
run the first one I'm like a volunteer obviously but I talk with soldiers quite a bit and you

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:27.420
know it has not diminished people are very hyped and still willing to do what is necessary to do and people always say

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.480
like you know we didn't choose the war obviously but it's here so what else can you do other than you know defend what

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.599
you love and what we love is Ukraine you know and our people uh so people from

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.420
the West say like oh we should stop this war we should go for peace agreements because we care about Ukrainian people

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.780
and yet no you don't you know if you cared about Ukrainian people you would listen to what Ukrainian people want and

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.299
what we want by every estimation by every poll in existence is uh to

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.519
continue fighting no matter what and to return our uh people back home and what

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:10.319
Russians are doing to those people there is atrocious and in a ways I cannot even describe to you every liberated city has

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.500
had Mass Graves uh tortures rapes Slaughter of civilians on insane scale

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.840
and this is the wait for us to liberate them so this is not negotiable we are

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.240
not giving up those people to Russia and to this nothingness basically is what

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.720
expects them if we give up on them and foreign

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.360
courts have declared that hey look uh Vlad Vlad Putin is taking children look

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.840
at the irony if you cannot taste the irony of this

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.000
Vlad is abducting children like a pirate

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.139
yeah and he's forcing them putting them in camps forcing them to speak Russian

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.540
no more Ukrainian no more Ukrainian you'll speak Russian

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.960
right look at the irony here about those who support Putin

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:29.639
this is a strong woman people talk about strong women in the States this is a strong woman she was

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:36.539
involved in the 2014 Revolution and when I get a chance to interview her

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:44.880
I've been waiting but apparently herkiv was hit by gifted with

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.060
with hypersonic missiles and drones and all sorts of things to keep them in the

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.840
dark so as soon as we can I will get an interview for her

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.680
um she's agreed to do and I'm gonna ask her I'm gonna ask her about the nitty-gritty let her speak should we hit

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:12.600
her again with the Western support we had heaven right now we have every chance to win it and we attend to we

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:20.220
intend to do that and I hope we will continue please do if you can to support maybe Ukrainian volunteers I have a

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:26.819
PayPal as well by the way on my Twitter which you can help out and see what I'm doing on Twitter I post like pretty much

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:34.580
everything I'm doing and yeah so assist organizations that help Ukraine such as

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.380
come back alive for example which is a pretty good fund to help Ukraine or

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:46.440
maybe help like volunteers like me for example and people who are doing projects of helping our army in every

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:53.880
way we can and also talk with people about it is also very important so you know to come to find fight against some

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:01.800
narratives that Russia propaganda continues to spew and those who support Russia in the west as well so do try to

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:12.120
you know to fight them back and to spread the word so bringing this message just

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.600
how how difficult is it for us just to bring we have the technology now we can

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.819
bring her message out right and we can show the world right we

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:29.039
can be those people who put that statue of the Virgin on the hill and said

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:36.599
Freedom that's what it's about that's what it's about one more time so they already did some moves like they

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:41.759
did in 2014 to achieve that and I do think they would be full on ready for

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:49.139
all-out Invasion uh into Georgia and boldova but tennis with them up you know

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:55.020
so they so these are stopped currently at Ukraine which is I guess for us to be

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.240
the shield sort of to Georgia and to Moldova and protect countries from well

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.900
you know with our with our I guess bodies and lives you could say because they should not move anywhere further

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.940
and they should be stopped for good this time around I hope why are we not

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.460
helping these people why are we not hoping these people why we have you know giving money to Ukraine if we could help

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:24.419
this and help that and you just like dudes like I we super appreciate the help obviously right without it would be

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:30.780
but um it's not because you give money to Ukraine that are homeless people in the United States you know they just

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.880
point out various problems in the United States and they try to blame it on

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:41.279
United States helping Ukraine against this unjust Invasion which is uh pretty

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:49.740
strange because there's no connection to those things whatsoever yeah fantastic right listen to it from

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:55.500
The Source I mean that isn't that what we need anyway you don't need any commentary you don't need to explain it

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:03.300
you just need to hear the voice we're gonna hear one more and then we're gonna jump into the cave I'm talking about this holiday which is

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.019
four million people

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:15.720
crane but also they would take food like Soviet soldiers take it to Moscow export

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.120
it continue to sell it while people were just straight up dying of starvation so

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.279
fight fight with loss is something that was on the books so it's the the fact

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:31.320
that you can shoot a person in Ukraine like in a head for stealing food so

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.839
basically starving people would still still is not the word I would use but you know but still the food they

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:43.980
themselves grow to you know not starve and to feed their families and they will be shot for that so yeah so this was a

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:50.339
very much like uh you know a genocide in every sense of the world and uh yeah it's not only that like I said it's like

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:55.680
Mass deportation oppression executions there was like Red Terror period which

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.500
was uh uh right after revolution basically in October so that was the

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:07.740
period when Red's Terror uh was happening in Ukraine as well so people were just killed dragged down out of

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:13.880
their houses shot for not being willing to be part of Soviet Union Russia

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:20.100
yeah and that's what's coming they're standing in the breach there and that's

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:26.220
what's coming so what is terribly ironic and yet beautiful at the

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:35.519
same time is that the group that holds the signs that say save the children is the group that supports and pushes the

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:41.880
um potent's desires whether it's one of our former presidents or whether it is

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:48.240
um people in our government this faction is there right so what do we need to do

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:54.420
what can we do but listen to those voices but bring those voices here and

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.579
say what is she saying all right where is this dragon

00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:05.940
right who breathes the fire yeah where is this

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:11.399
truth that we're looking for I guarantee it's on the side of protecting the mothers

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:16.740
and the daughters I guarantee you yeah now he's taking camps he's making

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:22.380
camps shame on us let me just say something to the Americans in the group

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:30.540
I know there's others from other countries but to the Americans man it was our experiment

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.940
right this was handed down to us the people who created this Freedom that you

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:42.420
feel and breathe and live in those people said you have to stand

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:47.940
you have to stand and if it meant going off to a foreign

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:54.060
country to to help the cause then that's what they did

00:11:54.060 --> 00:12:00.480
that's what they did Freedom we need Freedom not this tyrannical stuff is not

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:07.320
is not new it's not new so um I hope to have uh Anastasia in

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.600

about these migrations these Bronze Age migrations tonight we're gonna go one

00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:28.560
step back to the pre-history to the autonous people

the people call the pulaskians and you're going to be surprised to find out

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:39.680
the things that you got from certain places you didn't this is before

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:46.459
Christianity this is before Judaism yeah this is before any of the

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:51.899
monotheistic theistic religions before those things were kicking off well they

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:59.220
had some in Egypt too right but before those movements within the Mysteries kicked off

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:04.440
we have these pulaskians and we have these rights preserved within the

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:11.220
language and I'm going to take you back to some of the old language we're going to go to the to the Virgin right we're

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:17.160

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:41.459
yeah they say that Linus um composed this the Deeds of the work

00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:48.899
on the Deeds of Dionysus and then he did it in the pulaskian letters

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:55.320
in the pulaskian letters yeah and he left it behind in his little his little

00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:03.420
memoirs yeah nice also Orpheus Orpheus and pronapides

we're going to have some little Clues tonight we're not working with the

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:55.920
orphic letters we're working with the pulaskian

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:02.040
letters and the pulaskian letters come before come before everything

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:10.380
for everything we're talking three Egyptian culture we're talking pre-indo-european

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:18.720
we're talking about the basis the language the human language is spread out through the Mediterranean

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.540
and from which we're driving this right and this history yeah let's go to the

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:29.820
next one please I want to start here now Linus they say

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:36.779
composed an account in the plastic letters of the Deeds of the first Dionysus and of the other mythical

00:16:36.779 --> 00:16:42.480
Legends and left them among his Memoirs and in the same manner use was made of

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:50.759
these pulaskic letters by Orpheus and pronapodes who was a teacher of Homer great and a gifted writer of songs

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:57.600
right notice I just want you to see mentions Leah Maiden it talks about going to Nissa where the

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.660
ancient natives the city relate the Dionysus was reared there yeah and that there's this thing called

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:12.020
a phrygian poem yeah okay next text please

00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:19.740
this is the expression yeah in the pulaskian letters

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:25.740
good I want you to look at that pelaskian who are these people go down

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:32.100
this then is the account of dionysius among the Greeks Linus was the first to discover the different rhythms and song

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:38.160
and when Cadmus brought from Phoenician the letters as they're called Linus was

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:45.179
again the first to transfer them into the Greek language to give a name to each character and to fix its shape now

00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:52.860
the letters as a group are called Phoenician because they were brought to the Greeks from the Phoenicians but

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:58.860
as single letters the pulaskians were the first to make

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:04.500
use of the transferred characters so they were called plastic

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:11.700
okay you see what I'm saying so this is an old old old not this guy get him off there we'll

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:17.400
bring him back in a second this isn't that's a limiting steel anyway

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:24.240
um this pulaskian language that predates there's there's questions who are these

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:30.780
pulaskians and what are they doing there these these autonous people spread throughout from Asia Minor into Greece

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:35.820
right here's the sights nice math there look at they're on the island of lemnos

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:41.640
up there yep off the coast of Thrace right samoth race the samoth race there

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:48.059
take it down if you were sitting there on the beach in in Thrace you can look

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:53.760
and you can see samoth race there nice Island beyond that right beyond that

00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:02.400
where it's no longer visible is that linear and we have a lemian Steely and it has on it the um characters that

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:09.360
their P they were debating about this is Linden we're going to call it limnin but long story short it turns out it's

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.940
pulaskian and logically it looks a lot like Etruscan

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:22.020
yeah it looks like the Pulaski and the and the Etruscans are the same people those of you who are learning Dragon

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:30.840
tongue the orphic letters can use this to help you decipher them

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:36.059
okay and um let me just pull that up again by the way this is in bustrophodon

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:42.780
right so for those of you saying uh wow tell me does it go right left left right

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:50.100
yes the answer is yes it goes both right it's like a snake more than a more than

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:57.440
a cow walking around but okay whatever they didn't call it oh fistrofidone

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:04.679
yeah it's a word for snake okay next next slide please

00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:10.919
how did The Phoenician letters appear on the Greek mainland the Palace of Cadmus if Cadmus is an historical figure has

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:16.980
been discovered in Thebes and may be roughly dated around 14 to 1200 BC and

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:22.919
letters were found in it but they were not of Semitic origin take it down that's in the Journal of American

00:20:22.919 --> 00:20:28.260
Journal of philology right now we're getting philologists I'm going to quote a few philologists here tonight because

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:34.080
this is the stuff that turns them on this is all you do with it you're trying to figure out where his language has come from

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:41.400
that's why anybody who forbids you from speaking a language that's a bad bad dude bad dude

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:49.380
yeah needs to be stopped yeah um so we're talking early on 1600 right

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.400
next slide please

00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:01.200
thank you Chewie now Linus they say compose an account in plastic letters the Deeds of Dionysus

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:07.200
and the other mythical Legends and left them among his Memoirs in the same manner whoops we've had this but please

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:12.840
go on please go on yes um here we go I want you to see here further

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:18.780
further in there is a cave let's just go to the cave we're walking around sorry that was a little Herky jerky but we're

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:25.080
walking around with um the pulaskians and their religion and

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:31.760
we're going to their religious sites and we're going to look at their gods um all this

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:37.620
that sound is uh Pulaski and sound isn't that nice you see it in things like

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:43.620
chords yeah so there are pulaskian Roots all over

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:50.580
the place in the Greek world in the Greek world and there they talk about the pulaskians are all over the sources

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:55.799
you can go look them up right um uh and you won't you'll find in the

00:21:55.799 --> 00:22:01.679
historians you'll find them in the playwrights uh them Sophocles there's we have some great information from from

00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:08.340
Sophocles believe it or not yeah Isn't that cool um anyway it looks like they were they

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:14.640
were considered to be the ancestors right they considered to be the

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.880
um Greek sometimes they're described as Greek yeah and they're ending up in a lot of

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.400
old old Greek religion coming out we're going to look at one that shocks you

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:32.820
tonight from the from the Septuagint believe it or not it's buried in the

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.919
Septuagint Isn't that cool all right um bring up that next one here we go

00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:44.760
further in there is a cave circular and shape of marvelous size and Beauty just get the cult context going in your head

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:51.419
for above and all about it rises a Crag of immense hype formed of rocks of different colors for the Rocks lion

00:22:51.419 --> 00:22:58.500
bands and send forth a bright blame some like that purple which comes from the sea for the entrance grow marvelous

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:05.640
trees some fruit bearing others Evergreen and all of them fashioned by nature for another end and to Delight

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.980
the eye take it off and to open it

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:21.419
yeah to open it coming from the side was the expression yes yes okay next same slide good now to

00:23:21.419 --> 00:23:28.280
this cave the account runs almond came and brought the child who's that child that is Dionysus you mean

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:35.100
Dionysus is a child of Ammon yes he is and gave him into the care of Nissa one

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:41.760
of the daughters of aristeas and he appointed aristes to be the guardian of the child he being a man who excelled in

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:47.580
understanding and self-control and all learning the duty of protecting the boy against the plottings of his stepmother

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:53.580
Rhea he's signed to Athena who was short while before had been born of the Earth

00:23:53.580 --> 00:24:01.260
and had been found beside the river Trident good good that's why we call it tritonian

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:06.360
nice we need to find the location and a place for this we need to zoom in with

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:12.299
the language we need just to let the language carry us to that place

00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:17.340
we're keeping our hand on the rope in the cave as we go through it as we go

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:23.820
through it good next text yeah I'm not going to read all this I

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:30.000
just want you to see um when the Valor and fame of Dionysus became spread abroad Raya angered at

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.100
almond strongly desired to get a nice Dionysus into her power okay I want you

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:42.120
to realize there is struggle going on and that you see the word Crete right as for Cronus then this relates

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.460
after his victory he ruled harshly over these regions which had formerly been

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:53.780
almonds okay take it off yes the father of the first

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:59.840
Dionysus the father of the first Dionysus is usurped

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:06.659
by the Saturn yeah okay all right so that should put

00:25:06.659 --> 00:25:11.900
you in some context take out your everybody pull out your augers now

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:17.700
right right you know where we are sun moon and stars okay hit it with the next

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:24.419
please we're running for the time tonight go ahead yes since the libyans a set of Dionysus

00:25:24.419 --> 00:25:30.120
before the battle that as the time when amen had been driven from the kingdom he had prophesied that's what I want you to

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:39.240
see Amman is the prophetic God there is a reason that that cult is

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:45.059
spread throughout the Mediterranean and always has that oracular

00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:50.539
um current to it always has that oracular current to it

00:25:50.539 --> 00:25:56.940
the dedonian prophecy that is so important to the

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:03.000
Greeks right everybody goes to do Donna right that's just the way it is it's one

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.740
of the big big oracles and um that's pulaskian

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:15.720
yes yes so you see the operation people say did this come from Egypt did this

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:21.000
come from what about this settlement what about the Phoenicians there were no Phoenicians around they only call

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.080
themselves Phoenicians because of what the pulaskians were doing in the name Pulaski in

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:34.799
as a classical philologist looks like it comes from the word for

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:42.179
purple the purple dye yes yes the purple dye do we have that

00:26:42.179 --> 00:26:49.679
bring bring us up yeah palaki I'm right right relating to the Sea right palladio's in the Greek

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:54.840
we're following the Romans here right sea muscles go back to that please see

00:26:54.840 --> 00:27:03.980
muscles look at that seed muscles follow the way down the page to Roman numeral number two and look at B pelagium the purple color

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:10.440
are pulaskians are originally

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:16.320
of the purple the Phoenicians who take their gramata

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:23.100
who transmit that gramata to the Greeks or calling themselves the

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:30.059
purple people the Purple People we're talking

00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:35.640
pre-history right prehistory is where this is coming from

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:42.539
so don't try to tell me how it is that some antinomian got

00:27:42.539 --> 00:27:47.760
involved because he doesn't exist for thousands of years

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.760
yeah your Christianity and your Judaism

00:27:53.419 --> 00:28:00.140
they're just been non-existent they don't exist but the oracular

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:05.460
saturnian religion that they're promoting

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:13.559
this chance to have ionic life this thing is

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:22.799
very real and very much out of this old prehistoric people please next

00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:29.360
slide wonderful Egyptians I see you're Egyptian I'd raise your plastian

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.620
OS yeah look at the under a just look at

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.700
the first word in Greek

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:49.740
the seat of Pulaski and dodona look on the second line down I told you Donna

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:56.460
was big right that's he said by the way look at and right away you say wait a minute the

00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:01.980
pulaskians were the torsenoi yes yes

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:09.779
wait I know the the tarcinians also called by the Greeks the tyrenians

00:29:09.779 --> 00:29:16.080
that they were those people that the Romans with their Venus's

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:23.039
tongue called the Etruscans yeah

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:28.440
yeah fantastic so

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:36.140
um if you look at etroscan you're gonna find out it looks just like the old pulaskian right which

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:42.120
Scholars and classical philologists will have sat around for decades a century

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:47.820
this debate two centuries debating what the origins of these words are

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:54.360
some people say oh it looks like it's related deathration and trying to trace it right where it comes from originally

00:29:54.360 --> 00:30:00.960
yeah and it always goes back through the river of the Mycenaean Greek

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:07.080
right it's one of the places that it just made it's made its currents now give us another

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:13.320
um yeah and Cersei so coming to the Etruscans brings us to Italy and it

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:20.039
brings us to Cersei and Cersei the daughter of Helios hyperion's son love steadfast Odysseus and more Aries and

00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:27.240
latinus oh wait a minute what latinus that has the word Latin in it

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:32.760
who is faultless and strong also she brought forth to logonus

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:38.220
by the will of golden Aphrodite white golden Aphrodite that's a cult title

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:43.620
that's the Aphrodite Who's involved in the production right and they ruled over

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:51.240
the famous tisinians nice next next you see the cult is really the cult is

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:58.140
really what's pushing and driving everything and this is the area you see the the libyans in the South we have

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:04.140
Carthage there we have Sicily where diadoris happens to be from and the

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:11.039
terrainian power here this is this is a pulaskian power this is an early power

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:17.279
in the cult go ahead oh it's gorgeous next please

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:23.880
what are these people they are autoxon they're of the sun you don't call their

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:29.700
Zeus Zeus you call them a thonian

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:35.640
Zeus yeah a thonian Zeus

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.740
yeah nice deck guess what

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:48.600
yeah guess what it's so beautiful the language so it's just like Amber it just traps that precious bit of the past and

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:55.860
just kind of keeps it preserved for all time you can never take this stuff away uh next please

00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:02.340
yeah Pulaski and Aryan Medea so let's just look next slide

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:08.880
the first Dionysus was the son of almond yep

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:14.700
and look at this little tidbit right um some Georgian Scholars including

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:20.279
these Georgian Scholars connect the pulaskians with the ibero Caucasian

00:32:20.279 --> 00:32:25.679
peoples of the prehistoric Caucasus now into the Greeks

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:30.779
as Culkin's all right we're going right back to the

00:32:30.779 --> 00:32:38.700
garden we're going right back to Adam where those four rivers meet

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:44.820
and you're saying wait a minute I'm doing this but I'm doing it in a way that comes through the late Bronze Age

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:50.279
but I know that this is actually um 3 000 years previously

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:55.980
yeah three to five thousand oh my goodness yes that's where we are we're

00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:01.919
seeing the focus come through that medwa

00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:11.520
yeah please to blow it right to bring the end

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.860
of our search to its culmination right here we

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:22.500
are in the cave and we've been looking for that source for that origin

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:29.580
you thought you thought that Adam was a Hebrew name

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:35.120
it is not it is not neither is Eve

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:42.120
and you say how can you say that how can you say that it's contrary to

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:49.740
the last two thousand years yes it is but it's a fact let me show

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:55.140
you chewy hit him with a chart this is gonna blow your mind look at this look at the

00:33:55.140 --> 00:34:00.779
Linear B we have the Latin us nice and then we have Greek

00:34:00.779 --> 00:34:06.659
isn't this gorgeous who is this guy who is the Adam where

00:34:06.659 --> 00:34:13.500
right who is the Adam West who is that Adam

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:20.398
so when the sibling Oracle stand up and they tell you that Adam is Greek

00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:26.220
and it was based upon a religious practice each of the characters in his

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:34.679
name represent the action of quartering of quartering if you know Adam you can

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:39.898
quarter it's north south east and west and it

00:34:39.899 --> 00:34:47.339
goes back through the bronzes through it's captured in the Mycenaean Linear B

00:34:47.339 --> 00:34:53.240
which is where these people are it's why almond is in Crete

00:34:53.700 --> 00:35:00.960
yeah that's why ominous and Crete gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:07.800
nothing is the way you thought welcome to Almond's cave nothing is the way you thought I'm

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:15.180
offering you some of the most beautiful distilled reality that you can possibly

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:20.220
make and it drips from the ceiling of this cave

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:26.460
of the pulaskians the place where that virgin

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:33.839
becomes the Oracle that's why we're stealing everybody yeah Pirates man Pirates get dragged

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:40.619
into this right oh my God it's gorgeous absolutely gorgeous so

00:35:40.619 --> 00:35:47.940
um as we're trying to look at Dragon tongue we're trying to see how to decipher it we need to get serious about

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:54.060
its roots and we need to see the connection between the orphic letters

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:59.780
the pulaskian letters and the performance of the mystery

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:06.660
Dionysus is the son of Bacchus is the son of Alma right Bacchus is the son of

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:14.400
amla yeah yeah that Oracle was a bock

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.400
establishment

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:27.480
is not a native Greek word yeah it turns out it's pulaskian

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:33.480
so where do we go with the origins of Christianity which started with a man

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:39.540
getting arrested in a public park with a naked boy at 4am with stuff on his face

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:45.000
screaming about being thirsty and no I'm not a child trafficker

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.599
how do we get to that point is through this pathway

00:36:50.599 --> 00:36:56.280
through this pathway and how are we going to find this place again where

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:04.079
these this is our history right there's nobody here that doesn't share this history this is human history

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:11.280
yeah and um we need to find it we need to find it we've got people coming on do we have do

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:19.619
we have people in the gallery tonight yes we do we've got Rob I want to say a few words before we start in I seekonius

00:37:19.619 --> 00:37:26.220
and I see Snappy and I'm waiting for where where is is the Gnostic informant

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:32.300
we're waiting for Gnostic informally because he's going to announce something tonight he's gonna announce something he said

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:37.680
maybe give him a minute to pop in come on come on Neil if you're not going to

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:43.740
make your announcement I'm going to make your announcement for you but that's no that's looks that's I

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:51.180
don't want to do that all right let's start off with her just a response to the material that we're talking about with the pulaskiens Rob you've got first

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:59.160
shot what do you think about pulaskians and Dionysus my favorite part was uh

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:05.160
in the Egypt arrange you were Pulaski I really like that I'm gonna have to learn how to say

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:12.240
Pulaski in correctly and I'm going to use that one that was an excellent presentation again

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:19.140
that um I'm gonna have to catch up on you you're on fire you know you're on fire at the

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:25.140
minute thing you're written as hard with information because you know now there's there's some there's some way for it to

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:30.240
go a beautiful info on the orphic fair classmates because I'm sure they'll

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:37.440
appreciate that um I'll I kind of like the aristais part because if I'm right if I remember

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:43.200
rightly is the son of Apollo and the father of octail if I remember

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:49.320
rightly and that that means just little bits to me but for this to go all the way back

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:55.619
to its roots in the in the language and so see that in their Linear B is

00:38:55.619 --> 00:39:01.460
phenomenal and mind-blowing and rather conclusive in my opinion

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:09.078
fantastic fantastic um Snappy your response

00:39:12.619 --> 00:39:19.380
I'm I was really Blown Away by your lecture so the plasgians are something I've been interested in a while so a

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:26.760
philosopher I love is this guy here Linwood cloggis he wrote a book that I'm reading called cosmogonic Eros and he

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:32.400
uses the palazzkians as an example of sort of primordial culture and like

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:39.060
returning to like a a an original base for the Bronze Age and then he connects

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:45.540
that with the Bronze Age mystery rights in India and in other places and I just wanted like there's just so much cool

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:51.060
stuff he talks about here about how the scent the center part of of the

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:58.140
pulaskian society was almost taking care of the dead and the rights for the dead they'd be buried under the stoves in the

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:05.339
houses and right in the center of the home and everything was centered around these cycles of death and rebirth and

00:40:05.339 --> 00:40:13.940
they would wrap them in purple cloth it's uh really powerful stuff so we're getting somewhere really interesting hmm

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:20.579
fantastic fantastic and snap and uh thonius clonius give me your take on

00:40:20.579 --> 00:40:27.180
tonight I uh I thought it was amazing the the pulaskins being the root of the purple

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:32.820
and finding their origin of the language the the Linear B from what I take it I

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:39.960
think it's amazing and uh I think that they might hold the key to all the ingredients and how you said that almond

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:46.940
is the father of Dionysus blew my mind and you said that Kronos usurped

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:54.180
dionysus's first father and it makes me wonder if the only almond that I've I've read

00:40:54.180 --> 00:41:00.140
about is in the hermetica and I I just you blew my mind tonight

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:07.980
fantastic you have to you have to love uh you have to love the fact that years

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:13.440
later people would come along and take little bits of that and preserve it and

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:19.859
protect it and pass it on like Obama yeah and and

00:41:19.859 --> 00:41:25.560
um uh let me let me just ask sonis you were you brought in

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:30.599
oh some psychoanalyst I think his name was

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:36.359
young young you've been looking at some young does any of this stuff

00:41:36.359 --> 00:41:42.960
um have to do with young at all what you've been seeing well uh from what I've what I've been

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:48.180
reading about young is that he from what I understand in the red book

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:53.579
it it's like he is trying to mimic what Zeus did he's trying to go into the

00:41:53.579 --> 00:42:00.540
abyss and talk to Nicks and to know all things and and it it's it's it's it's kind of

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:06.359
it's kind of onto that I'm sorry I lost my train of thoughts no that's exactly that's exactly what I

00:42:06.359 --> 00:42:12.180
meant right he's putting it into it don't you don't you think he's practicing the mystery I mean he's he's

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:17.400
even getting responses about the future and from other people who are telling

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.800
him who are bringing him elements of the future that are are shocking him yeah

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:28.140
it's the operation of the mystery uh love it snappy I mean love it funniest

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:33.780
that you're doing it he even said that he got the settler he went down there and he pulled out the scepter from going

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:40.940
into the abyss and talking to the Oracle basically of night just like Zeus did in the Divinity papers

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:47.700
yeah yeah and now the question is was he doing that because he was drawing on

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:55.680
that reality right or was he doing it because he was reading it and recreating it well we

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:01.260
know with the with the boy that he was talking to at the the young man that he

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:07.800
was talking to at the um um who was inside the you know um place

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:15.180
where they kept people they didn't want running around um for whatever reason he was talking

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:21.359
about the future right he had never seen the this you didn't know about the release of this material he didn't know

00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:28.980
about um what it meant within ancient religion yet it found him within a person

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:34.140
right right gorgeous love love exonius Snappy

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:40.920
do we have any do you have any impression of the more easterly

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:47.160
a working of the pulaskians through caucus and through you know is there are

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:52.819
we getting over do you want do you smell India any in any of this

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:03.420
whoops I think you muted oh definitely so when I when we're

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:10.020
looking at uh Mycenaean culture you can compare a lot of this to what's happening in uh harapa in the Indus

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:17.400
Valley and there's a lot of key things like we're seeing the presence of the Bulls we're seeing the um the bull

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:22.920
wrestling Motif we're seeing these same horns in these horn figures and then

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:29.579
we're also seeing predominantly is that mother goddess figure with the snakes you know and then we know that they're

00:44:29.579 --> 00:44:35.579
both cultures are using cannabis are using the mushroom and they're engaged in this purple trade because we have

00:44:35.579 --> 00:44:42.300
traces of the purple and harappa but they're not producing it so they're getting it from somewhere right

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:49.619
and then there's also these seals that look a lot similar so there may be even a connection between uh the Harappan

00:44:49.619 --> 00:44:56.280
language and what's going on with the uh the Mycenaean gorgeous gorgeous and you know all

00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:03.300
there's so much of a frontier there for people to figure out put it it's like a puzzle to figure out where the

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:10.740
influences are coming from how the languages are being pressed on the civilizations and you mentioned the the

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:18.540
snake goddess right why is the snake goddess so prevalent right I mean it seems like a strange thing but there you

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:24.300
go you have it right and it's gorgeous it's at the very center of the cult the

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:31.200
use of these Venoms yeah oh it's an it's amazing we'll end up with Rob Rob you

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:37.440
have the last one you have the last word I think I think some of this mic is on if you guys can

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:45.300
mute rob you have the last word you have the last word I want you to say something please about Anastasia

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:51.780
Anastasia about China stage you very educated as

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:58.619
far as I could tell there's a very impressed with him with their abilities to um

00:45:58.619 --> 00:46:04.380
watch the messages as they came in as well as engaging a quite a a deep

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:11.099
engaging conversation and to do that take some she she could answer every question with eloquence and it got quite

00:46:11.099 --> 00:46:17.220
a great deal about it I just won't go to the snake goddess though because I

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:23.520
discovered something that I found profound that you know the snake goddess and she's holding the two snakes

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:30.660
that's that's the image we all see what I found is I found out is that's the votive that's the votive to the snake

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:36.000
goddess the snake goddess doesn't it doesn't she's she's the snake goddess of

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.640
course she's um was it but she isn't holding two snakes and I found that very curious and then I'm gonna go too

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:48.240
