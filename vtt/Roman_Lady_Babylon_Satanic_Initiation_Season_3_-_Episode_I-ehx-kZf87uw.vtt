yeah there's a diagram in that you know we're gonna see this that diagama most

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:03.480
people go ahead and bring me out most people think of the diagama from the Mycenaean Greek that's going back to

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:11.100
about 1600 BC yeah that Mycenaean Greek is the um

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:19.980
carrying that dicama but people refer to that as the origin and that the Romans cross the Adriatic

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:26.040
they really picked up through the Etruscans this association with the

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.980
diagama but there's a pulaskia note in this and the pulaskian culture we're

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:38.880
talking about older older do we have that math there you can show some people with references we'll

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:46.200
get there we'll get there in the sources yeah or here we go look oh this is trippy what's going on look right here

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:51.540
that's fine look here I am above the world and look at all of the places that

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:57.000
they have gone look at the Pulaski and culture these are all references right

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.500
so you got them heavy we also have them here we also have them right here oh that's nice Lesbos you know they call

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:10.800
the Island of Lesbos um pulaskia isn't that nice the land of

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:17.100
the pulaskians and this is the same thing we're getting in Northern Italy

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:24.180
through the Etruscans um the tyranoi right the atrocities didn't call themselves Etruscans man

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:30.600
that's never how it works out historically right that's what somebody else called them right the tyrannoy or

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.660
the tearsenoi um have a pulaskian

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:42.600
root so this is an older culture that's Bronze Age Bronze Age when you're

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:49.740
thinking Mycenaean you're thinking getting into late middle late bronzes you're getting into the late Bronze Age

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:57.899
boom you got this explosion of the of this right this mystery right so this is

00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:04.320
really going back to the origin um yeah even the sea remember the the C

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:12.480
we're gonna see the sea in a minute and we're going to see it through the purple this is oh my this stuff is okay buckle

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:30.779
buckling this is gonna be good okay let's get let's get another uh reference up fantastic yeah oh this this is um

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:36.959
um Juno yes asking Cyprus right

what is he he's carrying a quiver right my Cyprus yeah and um let that we are

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:56.880
all go see that last word on the second line that weirago is a that's Eve that

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:02.700
we saw before that's how we translate Eve in the oldest of the um Latin

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:08.040
versions right and so yes the only one that works that means

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:13.620
um lead from man right like the text says it's the only one but that we're

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:20.940
ago is that old Etruscan Minerva it's that some people would translate it

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:27.620
virgin but um what is she she's she that's a special word used in cult

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:35.399
and that means she who carries the diamond that's the inspired one okay so

00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:40.760
we're talking about a weirago which is a um

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:46.740
a you typically described as a manly

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.899

she is the one who brings the Abomination the anti-religious

00:28:36.179 --> 00:28:42.840
religion that is the oracular

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:50.279

00:29:39.779 --> 00:29:45.380
yeah so this is who Juno is seeking right this you and him

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:51.600

um but uh when the Pirates show up we're talking about child traffickers is what

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:47.039
we're talking about we're not we're in a we're in a different place so when Jesus is yelling about himself being a

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:54.120
Buccaneer he's not talking about the swashbuckling type that you might want to have dinner with he's talking about

the um type that or stealing children for

00:30:59.159 --> 00:31:04.980
the sake of the sex trade yeah which is not funny but when you

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:10.620
think of Jesus in that context it kind of gives you like an ew like an

00:31:30.179 --> 00:31:39.000
with Medea you're dealing with you're dealing with the bucket cult yes yes during her existence as she

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.080
walked around she was called Diana right it wasn't her

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:52.340
being named after the god it was her

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:59.399
she was the source she she was the source of dianic worship

00:31:59.399 --> 00:32:06.679
all right she has the right to kill The Stranger

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:13.380

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:20.940
stuff I'm telling you the drugs don't worry the drugs will ground us that's our Salvation these drugs will ground us

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:26.820
because they're going to show up here in the text in a minute you're gonna be like oh yeah a lot of people tell me

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:32.580
that all the time they're like oh I didn't think you actually met or I didn't think that there was actually

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:37.860
support for this or I didn't think that there was you were actually right right

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:43.559
it's not about theories and it's not about writing books and keeping your

00:32:43.559 --> 00:32:48.720
position and establishing a hoo-ha bruja it's

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:54.299
about those texts and about our integrity all right the translation of those texts

00:32:54.299 --> 00:32:59.340
that's really what matters here so let's go back let's let's keep

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:05.640

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:24.960
I recognize secrets that's Medea talking

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:31.620

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:38.000
polls do you know who she is do you know those poll Lords

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.640
SI morbus edit if there will be disease

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:50.220
if war is undertaken if it rains and

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:56.940
floods everything out or if the sky

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:02.340
is blazoned with the horns

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:08.398
of the red flames kurusket in Latin is a great verb it

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:13.980
actually does it it it's the image of horns driving through something love

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:20.220
that and yeah look at the last this is a really cute I mean this is the most

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:27.599
hilarious thing I've seen this bottom line here at Tu medium crazy yasan

00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:32.700
right so she's addressing that first that first um

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:39.720
you could say rapist um and not be wrong because he's a dude

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:45.419
on a boat who sails in a town abducts a woman and

00:34:45.419 --> 00:34:53.700
sails away right so look at what look at what the medwa

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:58.740
has to do right and he's just the first

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:03.900
he's just the first the dude comes in and he takes for the sake of sexual

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:09.180
purposes yeah he abducts

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:14.540
for the nymphising of the virgin

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:20.339
yeah yeah now it happened to be and we're

00:35:20.339 --> 00:35:27.240
going to get into that with the dragons that um uh remember that Medea is involved at a

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:34.500
very high level of late Bronze Age Society she is a queen and eventually

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:40.619
she ends up um um with what you could call as the the

00:35:40.619 --> 00:35:45.839
origins of the medo-persian power yeah

00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:51.660
yeah as a matter of fact we call them medes because of her name

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:57.420
yeah Medea right the medewa

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:02.880
the dewanasa yeah or the deewana

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:09.480
yeah nice it's gorgeous a lot more of it's coming through the Latin than you think right everybody's been emphasizing

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:15.920
and I have for the first two seasons I've been giving you all Greek sources

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:21.660
well as any philologist and this is what separates when you're out there shopping

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:27.660
around and somebody's telling you this is the Mysteries blah blah blah right

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:33.839
ask and they say Greek blah blah blah you can test them if they

00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:40.880
can't do ancient Latin sources good ancient Latin sources then

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:46.020
uh don't believe them because their Greek wasn't gained through the Avenue

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:52.440
of classical philology yeah right and every classical philologist

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.740
takes for granted that these two cultures

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:03.420
produced languages that interacted with each other

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:08.700
and that hide the the real goodies

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:14.820
the real goodies right like what's the difference between a Greek guys right

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:20.640
and somebody a Marcus uh and from the Latin tradition yeah what's the

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:26.040
difference this kind of thing is important anyway more tax somebody bring

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:32.099

under their Viper teeth under their Viper teeth

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:48.119
these anguists you know a lot of Greeks bring it back up because now I'm gonna

00:38:48.119 --> 00:38:53.220
look this is inevitable you're gonna get this there's conflicts and Antiquity

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:59.339
right linguistically there's conflicts and people will argue they'll tell you no no this is a Greek word of Greek

00:38:59.339 --> 00:39:05.400
origin and the other side Romans would be like no no there's a Latin word Latin origin here but most of the time you can

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.500
tell pretty easily but sometimes they fight over the concepts

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:16.079
and um that's what you're going to see here but bring up that text again

00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:21.720

plus boule C plus Boule the Greek which means Council and C is the tyrannian

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:14.660
or Etruscan for those Gods thank you John

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:22.040
so is there an Etruscan connection there was C Boule perhaps

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:28.079
these whisperings the civilizations

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:34.040
right are associated with oracular cult

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:40.859
the Civil who is that serpent I mean they're calling her for Frick's sake uh

00:40:40.859 --> 00:40:50.220
pythia [Music] Medea is the one that started this

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:56.040
if you don't believe me ask pindar who provides her in a fourth pythian out

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:03.180
he provides her prophecy that came from her mouth when she was on the island of

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:08.300
pharah it was preserved

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:13.380
by the pythian Priestess

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:21.599
that was in wrapped up in what uh pandar was describing so anyway I'm good

00:41:21.599 --> 00:41:27.359
stuff no let's get come on more more we're almost we're almost through it you gotta I just want to see it Lucifer's

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:33.960
there fantastic right fantastic there we are Lucifer right very important Aurora

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:40.980
that's why he saw Aurora before because you know that what family are we in we're in the family of the dawnbringers

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:48.720
right these are the dawnbringers okay oh look at this okay now for those of

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:53.760
you who think you're so smarty smart here is something

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:59.339
out of her lips right so we're within cult we're looking

00:41:59.339 --> 00:42:04.980
at imprecation right that's coming from her

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:13.160
it's coming from the source of the burning purple she says Soul testis hours

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:22.079
grandfather son Witness yeah sun is an s-u-n right soul

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:30.480
and for those of you who don't smell Rome yet you should start to now because the worship of soul is very important

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:37.400
this is her aus her grandfather

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:47.940
oh do you like that do you like that Percy's and mithras oh that's me if you

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:54.240
don't love that you're in a bad place guess where this is coming from guess

00:42:54.240 --> 00:43:01.500
where Mithra or Mitra is coming from is coming from the dawnbringers

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:07.140
right Luna deck was noctis Moon

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:15.660
that beauty of night Fourier the furies wait a minute yes Medea who

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:22.920
is the Priestess of the right

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:28.619
the right to murder The Stranger she's that Priestess

00:43:28.619 --> 00:43:34.680
and she is invoking her grandfather

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:41.940
mitras beautiful and we have the furies right because

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:49.079
this is the abominable right we thought it was over but when you

00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:55.140
stand before those Gates it turns out the universe strains you

00:43:55.140 --> 00:44:01.319
Pro serpina and pluton oh this is a death cult this is an underworld death

00:44:01.319 --> 00:44:06.960
cult yeah you're right that's why it's wrong for the poet to know this

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:13.859
wrong for the poet to profane but how is Medea described as the profaning

00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:21.200
Priestess are you beginning to see Lady Babylon

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:30.680
's Animas yeah receive the souls radiating Sun

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:37.880
you the bodies Luna the nutrient of the Soul

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:44.160
um lovely um at the very last the line look at the

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:51.119
last word this is a gorgeous word umbras uras

00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:59.280
umbras it means shades Shades those shades of those who came

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:06.900
before us right the leader of night

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:12.660
will bring those forward death

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:19.020
the dead shall rise again can we get a little less of the background I hope that backgrounds

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:24.359
that's not creeping in let me know in the chat if you're picking a background

00:45:24.359 --> 00:45:29.520
um fantastic um one more let's get another let's get another one please

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:35.400
um I just wanted to see Moses is here [Music]

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:41.640
right but here he is right we dug up Moses tonight and he don't be surprised

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:47.760
you saw the snake thing you saw a fact that he made a little tent where you

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.980
could walk into it and if you didn't pass out you could hear the voice of

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:58.859
Jehovah you heard that right he's the Muse baby right this is uh by the way

00:45:58.859 --> 00:46:07.020
this is a pretty contemporary stuff you know what I mean so um Moses it turns out was one of the

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:12.780
earliest Corruptions of Medea's mystery

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:20.400
yes Moses isn't that neat Jesus came later and added another Corruption of

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.920
the right and for those of you who need it more directly Judaism and

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:31.500
Christianity are both The Offspring of pagan mystery

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:37.500
a thousand years before either of them had anybody on the scene in diapers

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:44.640
yes this is wonderful let's go another one yes um she she has a chariot right she

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:50.339
has a chariot which is a fearful thing and um these dragons

00:46:50.339 --> 00:46:56.160
right they offer up to her right they they give her their necks

00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:03.300
yes these dragons who carry her song it was dragons that showed up

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:09.300
the night that she burned let's turn the we're gonna we only have like two quotes

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:16.200
left so we'll get to those but I want you to know the night I'm going along I'm sorry the night that she burned

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:21.240
right so get this in your head she is a queen

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:28.500
in Exile and she is

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:37.740
um she one night she Burns the princess and her father to death in

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:45.839
a wedding that was with the yasan premise first first Jason and for those of you

00:47:45.839 --> 00:47:53.160
have made the connection yet to Jesus it's the same name it's not Hebrew it's

00:47:53.160 --> 00:48:02.420
the same name in Greek yazon is a title within mystery cult

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:07.680
just like Christos yeah

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:16.980
that's interesting so this guy that got arrested in a public park called Gethsemane at 4am with a naked boy

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:21.980
and was calling himself a child trafficker

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:29.460
um he was using a title within a mystery quote that had to do with the

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:35.400
transmission within the blood um of the new life

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:43.619
yeah yeah the mystery is not a question it's an operation it's a performance

00:48:43.619 --> 00:48:48.960
yeah and we know that's why that naked kid was with him right there were snakes and

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:56.099
stuff he had to bring up the snakes but let's get to this last for those of you who doubt who doubt that our snakes are

00:48:56.099 --> 00:49:04.200
so important here even after we dredged up old Moses and forced him to lift up his staff with

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:10.319
a snake on it he could turn this thing into a snake you know what I mean

00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:16.380
gorgeous um even after that if you don't believe me I'm telling you um they're they're

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:22.319
working on this medically with dotes and antidotes and let's look at some why the

00:49:22.319 --> 00:49:27.480
snakes why the snakes people are gonna you watch within a within a period of time people will

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:33.240
catch on to this in Classics and history and they'll say what about the Venoms

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:39.359
used as drugs right it's just the way I started spouting this

00:49:39.359 --> 00:49:46.980
um years ago trying to get people's attention but nobody reads these tags dracontius they're

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:52.440
who reads dracontius nobody like bring him back up come here

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:58.079
buddy get up here bring him another uh another jacontius

00:49:58.079 --> 00:50:01.500
yeah auspicious

00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:18.240
you hear a little bit of the this is a couplet right ah ellijayak couplet it's got a line of

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:24.200
hexameter and line of pentameter it loses a foot

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:31.800
somewhere in the middle anyway um you can hear a little bit of it there kind of probably set the no Rhymes

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:36.900
because we don't rhyme it's more sophisticated right it's meter

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:44.579
anyway um let's translate this right so your ass

00:50:44.579 --> 00:50:51.660
can kill you right but your your snakes also are medicines right they also have

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:57.660
medicines this says right your vipers you know oftentimes help

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:05.460
right and oftentimes they kill they kill it look at this here is the

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:13.380
here is the um here oh yeah I feel like glow can you feel like look warm it's

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:19.520
like around this midsection it's like a a bottom glow we'll call it

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:25.319
yes right no offense Sir With It

00:51:25.319 --> 00:51:31.740
um yeah now I forgot where I was look what happened I'm lost

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:37.380
um here we are the Vipers can help and um they can kill right so this whole

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:42.720
idea of this balance between the doubt and the antidote don't think that it's

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:47.880
not there it's it's the central heart of the mystery

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:54.000
um is there one more give me one more quote here I'm sorry oh this is gonna wrap it all you guys are gonna love this

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:00.180
I'll try to talk again kind of more seriously delicious

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:06.000
[Music]

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:20.339
oh isn't that nice conkula yeah that shell that little creature

00:52:20.339 --> 00:52:26.540
brings us the Delights and the death

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:32.280
from that deep deep wave

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:40.200
yeah she brings forth the true riches

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:44.838
of the burning purple

00:52:45.559 --> 00:52:52.740
in that second line of the couplet padalaji is a word that you can use to represent

00:52:52.740 --> 00:53:02.099
the sea or specifically the sea mollusk that gives us the purple

00:53:02.099 --> 00:53:09.540
that is our Phoenix our Phoenician power

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:15.480
yes you should see it and that's why that Phoenician princess

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:22.559
what is your name what is the name she's royalty she's the Priestess of a start

00:53:22.559 --> 00:53:28.920
right I think you call her Jezebel Jezebel

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:37.740
love it love it lady Babylon what does she have on her forehead

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:43.579
she has one name she of a thousand names has one name

00:53:43.579 --> 00:53:50.640
mystery it was hers historically she started it

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:57.800
it was only uh it was only accessible through her

00:54:00.119 --> 00:54:06.960
is that is that our final that's your final quote right good um I also there's a lot

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:15.000
um from dracontius over the next uh six weeks we are going to

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.640
focus on the Roman side we're going to focus on

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:26.880
yep on the this being the first week for the next six times that we meet we're

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:35.160
going to focus on that burning purple and upon finding it and looking at the

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:43.619
um the right as the exercise of regenerating the

00:54:43.619 --> 00:54:49.160
oracle so lady Babylon

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:55.980
can be made visible that's what they call it

00:54:55.980 --> 00:55:02.880
making the invisible visible yes it's it's gorgeous and

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:09.059
I will be bringing out little bits of draconthius here and there that are at the point that I think that would be

00:55:09.059 --> 00:55:15.480
most appropriate um but I do have a game plan for this third season

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:22.079
and we will be jumping into some rich rich Waters that you're not going to get

00:55:22.079 --> 00:55:28.740
if you want to sit around listen to people's theories right we don't need theories right we don't need to sell

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:34.740

00:58:01.079 --> 00:58:10.980
verse sorry yes yeah it's verse yeah and it's in the verse that is used by the

00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:17.880
um oracular Cults it is the dactylic hexameter and um so when of course

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:24.599
winonas who's writing his great epic of Dionysus he's going to use the same

00:58:24.599 --> 00:58:32.579
um way of poetry the same Melody right the same marching uh order that

00:58:32.579 --> 00:58:39.900
um the priestesses who are performing these rights that they're using right so

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:45.480
there's a level of authenticity to what dracontius is doing and honestly some of

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:50.760
the vocabulary that he uses is just it's incredible it's it's

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:57.540
um um you can see the influence of the Etruscan right it's right right there

00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:05.940
out in the open and um the richness of this bronze this early Bronze Age cult you know which if

00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:11.400
you can get just a glimpse of it you're a good you know you're in good shape but that's what the language does it brings

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:18.980
us that um uh let me ask Snappy Snappy how's your um

00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:25.140
project of interviewing going I mean I've I noticed that you're getting

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:32.460
you're kind of getting more focused what are your interviews going to start kind of what do you want to focus on

00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:38.040
um well right now I'm I'm focusing on interviewing people who have been connected to this and I've been enjoying

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:43.140
the conversations here uh tomorrow I'm going to be talking with uh Nick

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:50.280
cathonius who uh it's the joint Fight Club winner that should be good tomorrow night but really what I focus on is is

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:56.760
magical practice and how we actually utilize these this these Mysteries and

00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:01.799
what you've been showing us and what we've been doing here like there's been so much discussion about things like the

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:07.500
sortes and necromancy I really want to explore those Topics in depth and I want to have

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:15.540
um additional speakers who know about that kind of History come on as well ah see how see how that sounds good yeah

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:21.240
no that's see that's alluring that makes me wanna oh yeah fantastic Rob what are

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:28.140
you what are you doing for the world Rob Landing Greek at many that's why that's

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:36.839
where my focus has been but um we need somewhere where we can go and meet and we're kind of restricted

01:00:36.839 --> 01:00:42.180
at the minute so I'm not going to go into details but coming Wednesday I think we might have a

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:47.940
well we will have a solution there'll be another Discord going live on Wednesday

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:55.140
and I'll give the address out and and I'll be prepared and ready for it but

01:00:55.140 --> 01:01:02.599
um it's rather focusing on these episodes this episode is like the epitome of what

01:01:02.599 --> 01:01:09.180
this Discord will be about the sources And discussing what's what's

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:18.559
in them and what's in the episodes strictly the episodes that's all I'm really here for and that character

01:01:18.559 --> 01:01:23.760
let me ask you this question let me interrupt and ask you this question I'm trying not to Interruption I'm trying

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:30.000
not to scream into my mic anymore these are these are things that we notice as

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.359
we're watching a former season so I'm gonna try to try to be more professional this way

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:43.500
um Rob you're just tell the group you're you were not a classicist you didn't you

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:50.420
didn't study this when you were young you're coming at this new and yet you're

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:55.559
diving into the language and I'm gonna make you dive into the Latin now right

01:01:55.559 --> 01:02:02.040
which is great because I get to spank everyone I love it but um tell tell the

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:08.460
group you know what that means to you like because you know it's something come back you know in the middle of your

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:15.000
life to come back to something that's totally new like this but you see that there's there's a reason for it um tell

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.160
us like you know what motivates you it's

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.859
it's comp I'm compelled every day each and every day see

01:02:25.859 --> 01:02:30.900
bye bye this morning I woke up and I've come

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:37.980
down and I've made sure that I can remember all the declensions for the nouns and I want to write this all out

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:43.040
but what what where that comes from is um

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:50.280
it's just a fascination where where I'm coming from and I'm

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:58.500
going into something through you that is it's it's just compelling fascinating

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:03.839
and drives every each and every day at the minute and

01:03:03.839 --> 01:03:09.299
um it's only increasing because you're saying now Latin is going to come to the

01:03:09.299 --> 01:03:15.119
front and then keeping up with everything is is hard

01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:22.980
work it's hard work but I don't I can't come away from it there's no coming away from it that episode is just

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:28.799
shown so many ends up for I knew it'd be good I knew

01:03:28.799 --> 01:03:36.540
that episode would be good and I I hope people go back and watch it again because there's so much in it and draw

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:42.240
out what the what what is in it because it's pretty damn

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:49.099
conclusive what the the path of the Ark you've just took it on has taken us to

01:03:49.099 --> 01:03:56.400
any covers all the research I've been doing for the past two years and it's coming

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:03.359
from a Latin a Latin source and he's giving you the diagram which is the

01:04:03.359 --> 01:04:08.880
indication and it it's the it is showing you where this is originating through

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:16.319
the language and that to me is is Magic

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:23.700
well we've got to get sweaty and in the pit with the uh with the Romans yeah

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:30.180
we're gonna get naked in the pit with those mythrake um officers yeah we've got to get in

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:35.299
there I love this and um there is

01:04:35.339 --> 01:04:45.299
there is so much that I want to share with you um that it is uh you know that allows us

01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:51.059
to build that scene better so that we can just see what's the freaking reality right none of us we're not here to start

01:04:51.059 --> 01:04:57.359
cold somebody was asking me um about uh what kind of people do you

01:04:57.359 --> 01:05:04.680
want listening you know do you want participating um I want all kinds of people I don't

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:10.260
care what you are you know um I don't care what your uh what your

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:17.700
religion is I don't care what group you're in I don't care where you go hang out and you know wear jackets I don't

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:24.059
care about that stuff um none of that stuff is important and here we preserve the Integrity of the

01:05:24.059 --> 01:05:29.760
Muse we go right to those texts and we work with those texts if that can help

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:35.819
you to break into the reality that look Jesus Christ was a dude who got arrested

01:05:35.819 --> 01:05:40.859
by the legitimate authorities um in a public park with a naked kid

01:05:40.859 --> 01:05:47.579
okay calling himself a a sex pirate right okay

01:05:47.579 --> 01:05:53.220
um what happened in that picture right there's a reason to this right it's not

01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:59.099
the fairy tale world that's what I want is uh and I'll end with this by asking

01:05:59.099 --> 01:06:06.660
snappy snappy are we break talking through to um to the reality uh is this

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:13.020
productive or you know what you I'm giving you the last word yeah I mean it

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:19.740
it's beyond productive like I don't understand how people can't see these things we have these titles we have

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:26.400
these positions like it's explicit now when we when we see what Eason is doing

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:33.539
right and then you look at all of these other characters it's almost like laid bare and why this is so important is

01:06:33.539 --> 01:06:41.160
because there's been a cover-up there's been an orchestrated effort to remove this kind of magical connotation and to

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:49.319
whitewash and sanitize Jesus and everything he's about and it doesn't know we can't allow that you know

01:06:49.319 --> 01:06:57.319
I could not I could not say that better hail Satan hail Satan

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:04.480
[Music] [Applause]

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:07.869
[Music]

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:17.599
