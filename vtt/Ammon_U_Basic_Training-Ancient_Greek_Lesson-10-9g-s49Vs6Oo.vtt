child you see in Antiquity it wasn't a

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:54.800
question of a mother's capacity to bring life and bring death

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.079
it wasn't a question of that

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:08.720
the Earth the prime Oracle I'm talking about a woman now right in case you didn't

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.399
notice Greek history was heav in Mediterranean history was heavily heav

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:20.480
Egyptian history was heavily heavily influenced by mother

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:26.279
Greek and that's why we have all of this right it's the language she's the

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:33.199
true Queen and that's why you need Tower of Babel to come through her because she

can you possibly end up slaughtering children sacrificing children just like

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:21.839
you would the lamb do you understand what this

00:41:21.839 --> 00:41:27.760

let me show you the sacrifice don't get nervous I know you got nervous like oh God what is he gonna okay let me show

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:40.079
you the sacrificing the Greeks say that

00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:46.760
Kronos right Saturn he drank down his children he

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:53.599
drank them down drank them down drained them dry they're fluid and why did he do

00:41:53.599 --> 00:41:59.000
that so he could give them back

00:41:59.839 --> 00:42:06.520
protected invulnerable yeah you thought the whole

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:13.160
eating of the children thing which by the way when a mortal

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:19.599
sees this happening it's quite creepy yeah especially when they do the

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:24.800
putting them in the fire putting them in the fire you know where this you know

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:34.240
where this magic right went it went all the way from here from taking a child and purifying it protecting it with

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:40.640
magic it went all the way to the Christian side of what are they doing on the

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:48.480
Christian side they purify the boys with fire how do you purify a boy with

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:57.680
fire according to the kesis that we have um you first of all strip them naked

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:04.040
and you tell them don't worry it's it's okay that you're naked because Jesus was naked on the cross

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:11.000
[Laughter] Tada then you what do you do with them then then you oil them up and this is

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.599
after you've been having them uh retain keeping food from them right you starve them for a couple of weeks you'd be

00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:23.839
surprised how malleable people are with drugs when they've been starved as a matter of fact you cannot enter the

00:43:23.839 --> 00:43:31.119
Mysteries without a process of fasting it's part of the deal and you know

00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:36.760
there's probably a ton of people Shaman in South America would say oh that's because that's how the drugs have to

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:43.400
work blah blah hooa and they're right they're right so um okay give me the

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:49.400
next one what else is she give me oh I want to put up some magic words

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.200
here are you ready atleta

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:06.000
you can read it backwards and forwards all you want because that's what they

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.599
do um this is a famous phrase made famous by a very religious person named

00:44:12.599 --> 00:44:18.359
escalus escalus was a big a big respector of the altar of

00:44:18.359 --> 00:44:24.599
justice and he writes about the woman are you ready um this is this is the

00:44:24.599 --> 00:44:31.440
Byzantine person who's using this phrase to refer to the Oracle to refer to the

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:36.480
mother who eats her children the drama of the mother who eats her children

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:42.760
right and what is she she is the one who

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:48.800
bears that which is unbearable she's the one who

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:56.480
suffers that which is you're incapable of suffering it's so weighty that's her

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:03.160
okay that is why you sacrifice your children

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:09.200
don't pass your children through the fire says the text why because people

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:14.680
are passing their children through the fire as a

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:20.000
right it is a right meant to bestow

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.839
immortality they called it burning off your mortality and it's very painful when the

00:45:25.839 --> 00:45:31.000
kid yells and you know it's being fumigated while all this is happening

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.559
and they're putting christing it oh my God what do you do right get your oils

of that very strange working of the Muse so what is happening now with the

00:47:53.800 --> 00:48:03.040
release of aus the Mist the death Mist that is around you and will dominate you that

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:10.319
death Mist produces a new work of the Muse and that is what the

00:48:10.319 --> 00:48:16.440
Antichrist is here to do did we see the Antichrist passage again it's coming up

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:21.920
it's coming up where did he where did he go where did he

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:29.880
go where does media where what does media not

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:36.520
do he's very specific their Byzantine author is very specific he she doesn't

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:41.880
sacrifice the child The Offspring to her

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:48.680
stomach that's not what you're doing when you consume the child it is an act

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.720
that is not meant for yourself it is an act that is meant for

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:59.200
your Offspring the Earth the prime

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:04.640
Oracle gives us what she gives us for the

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:11.960
sake of all of us not for herself isn't that gorgeous so the original Savior and

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:17.960
that's what he's going to do he's gonna have us confess for salvation right this because they're in a tri it's not a

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:24.520
trial anymore it's a woman who's eating her children who's talking to um talking to a

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:33.559
Confessor yeah um I forget there's a title for him it's in the first couple of lines um something DK it's got dek on

00:49:33.559 --> 00:49:41.000
the end of it justice Minister of Justice like anyway um let's go to the Bible because is this whole child eating

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:47.920
thing and sacrificing thing in the Bible of course it is because the Bible is written in the thir Century right and

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:55.280
it's reflecting things that are going on around it so watch this faking of History what you're about to

00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:03.000
see is part of the biggest lie of History what is the biggest lie of history that the Bible was written like

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:09.440
8th Century 7th Century no it wasn't it was written in the 3 Century right and

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:16.480
so what is going on in the thir Century it's influencing the Bible watch the story gets who is this this is from the

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:22.119
Book of Judges this is chapter 11 this is yea

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:27.720
and what does yea do he sacrifices his daughter

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:33.839
his child are you ready to watch him sacrifice his child why would this judge

00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:39.480
of Israel in this fake history because right when about the period that he's writing about none of this stuff

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:46.240
actually happened there's no archaeology for it right and it's obviously a

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:52.119
fake right it's a fake watch watch how they they follow um he sacrifices his

00:50:52.119 --> 00:50:59.200
daughter why does he do that why does he do that watch this here's the passage message um who is he after all who is

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:09.400
this judge this judge who is he this judge of Israel is the son of a

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:14.880
prostitute and it turns out um her son

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:20.720
was from a dude who you know he was well off had a lot of things and he had kids

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:27.559
from his wife and his wife and his kids got together they're like you got to get out of here you're the son of a

00:51:27.559 --> 00:51:33.319
hooker you got to get out of here okay now who is this dude look at the next

00:51:33.319 --> 00:51:42.040
verse 29 at the top what does he do and yeth did what he gets the spirit of Kuru

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:49.559
he does what he enters into that spirit that PMA where the prophets enter into

00:51:49.559 --> 00:51:57.079
and he makes a deal with Yahoo he makes a direct deal with him if you let me

00:51:57.079 --> 00:52:05.839
kill the army of Ammon because that's who they were fighting at the time in the story right

00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:13.040
why would they be fighting that by the way for the for the Jewish people out there I want to liberate you tonight

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:19.440
that stuff was invented in the 3 Century your actual history is way more interesting and you come through Creed

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:27.040
did you know that you come through crate yeah yeah it's fantastic it's

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:33.240
fantasttic they knew that in Antiquity right why didn't we just read their Works try to figure it out because the

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:38.359
monism that is the modern religion of Judaism is no different from

00:52:38.359 --> 00:52:45.119
Christianity Islam or what they came up with when they woried aten under

00:52:45.119 --> 00:52:50.839
aanan who did they stop worshiping when they came up with the monism they

00:52:50.839 --> 00:52:56.559
stopped worshiping the ogdoad the eight what what is huh the

00:52:56.559 --> 00:53:03.559
eight was led by Ammon and they are the basic rulers of the

00:53:03.559 --> 00:53:10.520
cosmos it's a physics that's no different from the physics of the practics it's no freaking different the

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:17.000
mechanics are all the same and what did the what did the monists do they said we

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:24.200
no we're gonna have one God and everybody else is dead that's all there is to it it's dead right and we're going

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:30.200
to make up history about this one God right it's the same

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:35.440
thing they all do the same thing aanan group did it right 1300 years before

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:42.079
this right or a thousand years before the Bible was written aanat was doing the same thing he was a king a pharaoh

00:53:42.079 --> 00:53:50.319
who was coming up with a new system that was a monism that could exclude all of his enemies right that's that's never

00:53:50.319 --> 00:53:55.440
going to work it's tyrannical right polytheism is inherently

00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:02.359
democratic monism is inherently tyrannical why do you think they're all talking oh Lord

00:54:02.359 --> 00:54:09.160
we're your slaves blah blah who didn't you recognize the Tyranny remember what the Oracle said

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:14.599
straight from the devil man I I'm telling you you'll find no help in your

00:54:14.599 --> 00:54:20.400
wealth for what you're about to endure you find nothing for it why your greed

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:28.680
man your greed has ruined everything it's ruined everything give me the next one there always like that what happens

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:34.440
with this guy um he he swears an oath he swears an oath with Yahoo and he says

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:41.880
look if you give me so that I conquer this Army of Almon what I'm gonna do is

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:48.640

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:07.760
genocide and what is he doing and why is it a genocide because monism promotes genocide okay you look at the

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:13.480

Israel perform this ritual

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:13.839
morning this is why they perform this Festival this is why they go up in their bucket groups I just told you to the

00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:21.400
Jewish audience out there not only are you originally Craton right

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:26.839
but um you're participating in bonic orgies

00:58:26.839 --> 00:58:33.920
bakic orgies yeah your religion is originally

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:39.359
bakic and I'm not the only one who says that Plutarch says that straight up

00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:44.720
Judaism is taken from the worship of bacus and then he starts to Rattle off a

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:49.960
whole bunch of for this reason this re he goes through all the symbols and whatnot and all the Priestly stuff

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:56.760
that's going on um so cool cool that's your real Heritage you were not

00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:02.559
monists and by the way that's how it works for the um Arab Community as

00:59:02.559 --> 00:59:09.440
well yeah no you guys were worshiping bakas and Aphrodite long time before you

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:15.760
the the concept of a monus Divinity ever came about remember it was only after

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:23.440
that monest Divinity came about who was a dude that you guys got the 70 virgins you didn't have 70 virgins before that

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:31.200
right that don't you think that that's not in the makeup right just listen to yourself listen to your inner reasoning

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:36.440
on that one right think about that for a minute I thought we were supposed to

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:44.920
throw the acid up no no no right no logic that is your Pagan root isn't that

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:52.880
interesting what we've done tonight isn't that interesting somebody comment on this we just said the Jewish

00:59:52.880 --> 01:00:01.039
people and a particular group group of Muslims were originally from the same

01:00:01.039 --> 01:00:08.280
religions wouldn't that shock you wouldn't that shock you to know that they were originally

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:13.960
polytheists right oh my God oh my God

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:21.160
it's only when the monism comes to the surface that all of a sudden people got to be put in cages and you can't do this

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:26.680
or that and by the way porn is going to be illegal again right do you know how

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:33.640
hard it was for my generation in the 70s and early 80s to access that do you know

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:40.079
how hard it was because the pressure exerted by the monis was so strong they

01:00:40.079 --> 01:00:46.440
had every aspect of your life wrapped up you couldn't even see it nudity oh my

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:53.880
God we had to worry about looking at ancient statues can I show these pictures to my students can I show that

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:59.720
was a problem right we're going back guess what we're going back there and by

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:07.000

01:01:57.079 --> 01:02:03.200
you're kind of on the extreme now you know what I mean kind of getting misogynist you know what I mean kind of

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:11.119
going that direction historically um that tends to happen historically watch the misogyny and the

01:02:11.119 --> 01:02:16.960
culture be a reaction by Ultra and it's why you've

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:23.480

yes because of her eotic flesh remember I told you if you'd been

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:22.760
in the mystery you would have understood this already right you would have seen it take place it would have fried your

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:28.160
mind your eyes would have been open and you'd be walking around saying now you know the best thing I ever did best

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:33.880
thing I ever did was go to that mystery initiation best thing ever and you the

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:40.039
other person would be like well tell me about you really can't right it's a thing you got to go through it they got

01:04:40.039 --> 01:04:47.200
to train you right this is going to be a work of the Muse that is

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:54.480
completely Athlon athletically driven completely athletically

01:04:54.480 --> 01:05:00.839
driven okay okay this is no The Muse doesn't mess around this has got to be

01:05:00.839 --> 01:05:07.520
done right give me the next one give me the next one um that was the last one yeah so oh by the way this eonic flesh

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:16.279
what do you do with it you eat it right what is what do you do with flesh you eat it so you quote unquote eat the

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:22.640
Flesh and drink the blood and his question is here we're asking the we're

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:30.000
asking the woman who's been eating her children um what how can you do this and not

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.559
die how can you eat this flesh and not die remember what Jesus said I'll give

01:05:36.559 --> 01:05:41.680
you that death inducer and it won't kill you you're remember what happened in

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:47.279
Eden their eyes were opened all right that's where you're

01:05:47.279 --> 01:05:53.319
gonna go into death and back and when you've been into death and back you can

01:05:53.319 --> 01:05:59.880
tell all your friends oh don't worry it's for this reason and this reason right or you can tell your friends holy

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:07.440
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know what I saw oh you've got to stop this or that right you can't we've gota we've got to change things

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:13.200
that's the right that they're performing boom and what do we say what do we ask

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:21.079
this one how did you do it did you have any assistants who knew the EOS look at the second to last word Eon did you have

01:06:21.079 --> 01:06:27.359
any assistants who knew the poison and let me tell you what she says you want you know why I can tell you what she

01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:33.839
says because I'm going to translate this now is a good time to reveal the drama

01:06:33.839 --> 01:06:40.880
now's a good time to reveal a drama are you ready look I'm using the Greek to speak for me it's like automatic writing

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:46.440
or something I love it why are we doing this in order that you may

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:52.079
escape the three OS in the day of judgment what do I need

01:06:52.079 --> 01:07:01.440
to escape three umos what is that it's a hym to a to who

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:08.440
bacas why do I need to escape that because if you hear that you're G to die if you hear that it means they're

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:13.559
coming for you orus and they're going to take your head

01:07:13.559 --> 01:07:21.760
off okay this is what you need some sort of Pardon from this day of judgment you

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:29.000
mean it's talking about the day of judgment that's a pagan thing yeah it is a pagan thing most definitely and um

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:37.200
what is she daring to do so she says look um you got to do this stuff you got to have some kind of anthropo

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:44.000
tonus anthrop oous excuse me in English it would be anthropus you've got to some

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.880
have some kind of assistants who know about killing people right you have to

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:57.079
if you're going to eat your own child you gotta have to know how to kill them

01:07:57.079 --> 01:08:02.799
okay do you understand we're taking these children we're subjecting them to

01:08:02.799 --> 01:08:08.119
rights that that have chemicals involved and we're putting them into

01:08:08.119 --> 01:08:13.200
death to bring them back why would you do that to bring them back

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:19.719
Immortal because once you've been across you bring back with you the

01:08:19.719 --> 01:08:26.560
memory who's the mother of the Muse the memory of what is reality

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:34.040
you are covered by a fog a fog of confusion and the only way

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:42.640
for you to come to an understanding of your true reality is through this

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:48.920
right if it's good enough for cisero you know what I mean if it's good enough for

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:56.080
Cicero maybe it's good enough for me give me the next one give me the next one who are the Servants of this great

01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:03.600
Priestess okay I've shown you I've shown you a goddess tonight that you didn't realize she is an Amazonian

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:09.520
goddess I've shown her to you you're on Lesbos where they founded colleges for

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:14.719
women for women why didn't they teach men because men are

01:09:14.719 --> 01:09:22.278
stupid men are stupid didn't you realize that okay imagine a

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:27.480
world where the bias is

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:33.278
against men because of their lack of intelligence they're not biased because

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:38.318
of their phys physique and by the way anybody who's watched the Olympics holy

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:43.640
mackerel where was that weightlifter from where was she from De you it Italy

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:49.159
I think it was Italy was it Italy yeah oh my

01:09:49.159 --> 01:09:57.520
God I I watched her lift and I thought this is this is what it's supposed to be

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:04.440
this is like the potential is that why the Olympics are so fun because they show you the potential right because you

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:13.880
know you and I'd be laying on the sidewalk huffing and puffing we can't go there we can't go there right why

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:21.199
because we stopped we stopped worshiping the gods right it's okay though because you

01:10:21.199 --> 01:10:27.000
lost the formula you lost the recipe without the recipe there is no Priestess

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.400
it's got to work through her and that's it it's why it's why what's his name

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:38.400
that rich guy who's the rich guy Mr brain imp plant what's his

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:46.040
name oh Elon it's why Elon never finds historically that Fountain they never

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:53.679
find that Fountain it turns out you can't have it you can't buy it you can't create it you

01:10:53.679 --> 01:11:00.600
can't recreate it it's got to come through the Muse it's got to be

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:06.600
organic completely organic it's an organic process that is a the formation

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:13.760
of what they call a new or strange work of the Muse and this Muse is the dark

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:19.600

that cannot be born they cannot be endured because of their force and that

01:11:39.639 --> 01:11:45.040
word for Force there is the same word for force that is used

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:50.679

okay friction do you see the friction that's caused

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:46.679
historically we're talking about rights that are chemical and sexual part of a

01:19:46.679 --> 01:19:52.760
culture Christianity reacted to itself when it

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:59.960
cut this off of its own body because Christians followed the Mysteries and

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:07.920
that is what this text is saying the reason it's Enlighten is the dude doesn't want you to understand what it's actually saying it's a way to hide it

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:15.320
it's a way to hide it and you know what he says here he says here that's okay I'm tiny he says here at the time that

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:22.080
we all celebrate the passion of the Lord you know they bring the girls into

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:29.440
this specially designated area oh God he starts you know this is going to be terrible to talk about right and any

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:38.120
sort of light is going to shine on this act they get rid of that light right this is all done in the darkness all

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:45.080
done in the darkness and what do they have they have a flti test you know

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:52.239
there's a real ftium going on what they're doing is they're

01:20:52.239 --> 01:20:58.719
allowing those people to express that

01:20:58.719 --> 01:21:05.920
desire do you know how to keep people from becoming the RW that none of us can say

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:11.880
with an IST on the end of it a banana IST right you know how to keep people

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:17.920
from becoming that train them train them sexually

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:25.360
train them chemically you know it's not just the lce it's not just the icient traders in

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:31.880
the purple who were also trading sexual slaves it's like Jesus it's not those

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:38.280
people alone who understand the use of drugs in the sex

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:45.639
trade they weren't the only ones who understood it right today look at what's going on today people understand that

01:21:45.639 --> 01:21:53.280
today the use of drugs to mold and shape and groom a person is a

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:59.400
reality what they are doing in Antiquity in all sorts of places all over the

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:09.600
Mediterranean is they are using drugs and sex to shape people they will burn off

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:16.760
your mortality they will open your eyes and when you have seen what is floating

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:24.080
around you perhaps you'll figure out a way to use it yeah because you'll be awake

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:30.440
otherwise be asleep like everybody else I don't care I don't care right who cares the

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:36.679
invisibility around you who cares the oracular the prophetic who cares right

01:22:36.679 --> 01:22:42.920
as long as we get the history do we care do we have an obligation to these

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:50.440
texts give it to me I want to scare people I've got text will scare people are you ready on the expiry of 9 months

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:57.440
when the unnatural progyny of an unnatural seed is about being born they meet again at the same place and on

01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:02.600
the third day after parition tearing The Wretched infants from their mothers and

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:09.199
scarifying their tender flesh with knives they catch in basins the dripping

01:23:09.199 --> 01:23:17.920
blood and casting the infants still breathing on the pile consumed

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:24.800
them still breathing you're a mother and you're watching you're still

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:32.760
breathing infant child be bled and burned now the question

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:41.960
is the burning doesn't kill so what's going on what kind of burning is

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:47.760
this they catch in basins the dripping blood and casting the infants still breathing on the pile consume them

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:55.400
afterwards mingling their ashes their ashes

01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:00.480
what are these ashes because actual ashes don't do

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:06.760
Jack right what kind of ashes are these mingling their ashes remember the mother

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:12.280
as she saw this being done to demophon she's like stop stop now you know why

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:18.280
she was saying that some horrific stuff is happening in this little

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:25.280
right right and it's got to be done by the mother who's willing to kill her child afterwards mingling their ashes

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:31.159
they make a sort of horrible compound with which secretly defiling their food

01:24:31.159 --> 01:24:37.120
liquid and solid like those who mix up poison with Meade you know those people

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:43.040
what is that a Bill Cosby reference right right seriously what is that

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:49.039
sudden reference to like you know those people who put poison in your

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:57.040
drink um not only they themselves partake of these Vines but others also who are not privy to their secret

violence when you're brought you are an instrument of

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:50.760
Justice when you are tuned to the violence imagine there's a capacity did

01:31:56.679 --> 01:32:03.239
of demonical practices through a certain Vagabond African who bringing him by

01:32:03.239 --> 01:32:08.440
night to a mountain isn't it funny they always have the same setup Jesus is with

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:13.560
Mary and the kids he's like well let's go out to a private place right so here

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:20.360
he goes up to his mountain and what does he do he causes him to partake of a certain herb right then he spits into

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:27.639
his mouth and anoints his eyes with a certain unle look how many drugs are involved enabled him to see a host of

01:32:27.639 --> 01:32:33.199
demons you know what happens when this dude does this to you you can see him

01:32:33.199 --> 01:32:38.320
you can see him from among which he perceived a sword of Raven fly towards

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:44.800
him and down his throat into his stomach and all the shaman in South America

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:50.239
Central and South America are like yeah that's how it works right it's nothing

01:32:50.239 --> 01:32:58.520
new it's not new technology people she and her find it now we're going to switch really quick to somebody who is

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:04.000
in that space of of consuming their child she in her confinement was very

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:11.320
ill and raved okay she's been through it right she's been through it the purple has been involved she's been through it um

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:17.320
and she's what is she doing she's tearing her bed ground bed gown she's muttering a sort of barbarous tongue

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:23.159
it's what they always do right Jesus on the cross is all oh sabach th he starts

01:33:23.159 --> 01:33:28.600
yelling out magical Gods they're always doing that in a low murmuring tone tone

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:36.480
nor could the bystanders comprehend what she said but we're in a state of perplexity not knowing what to do she's

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:42.760
in there she's in that zone and what happens give me the next one oh

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:48.360

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:06.440
be sent against us by whom the mysteries of our worship will be persecuted and

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:16.400
the mysteries of our service abolished right so people keep it

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:23.040
secret for you to access the reality that's around you for you to have your

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:28.239
eyes open opened people keep that a secret because other people are always

01:34:28.239 --> 01:34:35.400
trying to shut it down and Jesus knows this it's why he's

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:40.440
saying you know he's got 12 boys right it's why he's saying they're gonna catch

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:46.840
me they're GNA catch me and they're going to crucify me right why did he say they're going to

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:53.520
crucify him because that's what they do to people like him right he was crucified between two other people just

01:34:53.520 --> 01:35:00.600
like like him this is how it works and what's going to happen here

01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:06.040
somebody's going to come and they're they're gonna drive us out of town right they're gonna catch us they're gonna

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:11.560
scandalize us I don't know how many times Jesus Christ said um uh don't talk

about this you're gonna scandalize me and nobody turned around and looked like what's up with the Son of God dude he's

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:24.679

full of goodie um fantastic let's go I want to take you to another did we I

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:12.400
hope these are yeah here's some exercises here's some exercises I know I told you any order is fine but here's

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:17.599
what I really want to show you first I want to show you um the optative and the

01:49:17.599 --> 01:49:24.159
subjunctive moods the optative and subjunctive moods are used in specific

01:49:24.159 --> 01:49:30.560
types of constructions like conditional sentences if then types of sentences um

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:36.560
or purpose Clauses in order that we went to the grocery store in order to buy

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:44.960
food that in order is what you call a part of a dependent clause the main verb

01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:50.159
is I go to the store the the dependent

01:49:50.159 --> 01:49:58.360
verb is to in order to buy food right in order to buy that food so um this is

01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:04.560
what you use this is um this is why you use optiv and subjunctives is because

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:11.000
you're not in the world of simple declarations simple either somebody's doing something or being that's the

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:18.480
indicative what we have now for verbs is you can attach a different ending to that stem and you can come up with a

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:26.000
subjunctive or an optative let's start with the optative this is a an optative and the endings are o o

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:32.920
o o pretty straightforward if you get oi you're in the optative in the present

01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:38.960
optative oi notice this the same similar endings it's just um vowels are changing

01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:45.599
here well what about the arist Optive you've got two tenses of the optative and the subjunctive that I want you to

01:50:45.599 --> 01:50:51.360
learn you're going to learn the present which is here's the present optative and then you're going to learn the aist

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:58.840
Optive and why is that because when you're using the Optive and subjunctive you

01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:05.159
need to pay attention to aspect aspect is everything remember the

01:51:05.159 --> 01:51:10.639
verb has an aspect to it it's got a tense and it's

01:51:10.639 --> 01:51:18.000
got an aspect it's got a time that it reflects whether it's the

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:24.840
present the future or the past right and it's also got an aspect how do you do

01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:30.480
what is the aspect of the verb just by way of reminding you that is whether an

01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:37.480
action is being done continuously whether it's a simple action or whether it's an action that's

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:43.239
already completed that's the perfect aspect I have gone to the store right

01:51:43.239 --> 01:51:49.840
now in the present I am in a state of having gone to the store it's already completed I already went there it's over

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:56.880
so aspect is important and with the opt and the subjunctive you reflect aspect

01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:02.800
through the present and the aist and that aist is that single action that

01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:08.440
simple event they call it whereas the present is a

01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:14.520
continuous Progressive event right love it can be something

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:20.840
that's habitual something you always do oh you always do that I know because it

01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:27.679
works okay now what about the the arist did I put the aist optative in there let me show you the aist optative it's an oi

01:52:27.679 --> 01:52:33.119
yeah give me that one maybe that one there's the arist stative it's an oi in

01:52:33.119 --> 01:52:39.880
the present what is it in the arist it's an I look at how the vowel changes remember I told you the vowels are just

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:45.239
tuning the words right here it's happening again

01:52:45.239 --> 01:52:50.440
we're going into the arist and arist is heavy on the alpha we saw that with our

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:56.800
regular third principal part that arist we saw its ending

01:52:57.199 --> 01:53:03.560
a heavy on the alpha well it's the same thing with the optative only we got to

01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:12.719
include the Yoda too so the oi becomes I I me ice I I an I toon and those the

01:53:12.719 --> 01:53:18.599
standard endings and there's three look at the second person singular third person singular and third person plural

01:53:18.599 --> 01:53:25.360
see the AOS a and Aon those are all turn it you know those are those are endings

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:31.520
that you may also see that happen to be it's just a different ending um look

01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:38.920
what happened we're playing with the vowels look how it's ice becomes AOS AOS what are we doing we're really

01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:46.679
playing with the vowels right I becomes a right okay fine fine fine fine fine I

01:53:46.679 --> 01:53:53.000
becomes Aon all right all right that's the aist Optive now there was one more I

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:59.400
want to give you the subjunctives and the subjunctives are on one chart it's probably there probably

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:05.719
there the subjunctive you're GNA have a present subjunctive again and an era

01:54:05.719 --> 01:54:12.320
subjunctive that present subjunctive is going to be based on the first principal

01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:18.400
part that era subjunctive is going to be based on the third principle part and

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:25.199
what are their endings o AC a omen a to O now you're lucky what is this going on

01:54:25.199 --> 01:54:33.119
in front of you it's just the same endings remember the present indicative endings O A om

01:54:33.119 --> 01:54:40.159
USI these are the same endings only the vowels have been

01:54:40.159 --> 01:54:46.400
lengthened so we get Omega for the first person singular lengthened vow it's the

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:53.280
second person singular Ace a Yoda Sigma Ada Yoda Sigma make sure you see the

01:54:53.280 --> 01:55:01.079
Iota subscript Ada eota Sigma instead of Epsilon eota Sigma it's Ada eota Sigma

01:55:01.079 --> 01:55:07.520
so I tell all my students the real Mark of the subjunctive is that lengthened

01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:15.639
vowel that you're going to see in the ending o a omen a to O look at how amen

01:55:15.639 --> 01:55:22.440
a with an Omron changes to Omen with an Omega in the subjunctive that

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:27.960
lengthening of the vowel for some reason in their minds with that shorter form of

01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:35.520
the vowel you're doing things concretely with a lengthened vow you're

01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:41.000
getting into imaginary world because none of this stuff in the subjunctive is

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:47.560
real right it's not a simple declaration it's a possibility it's a potentiality

01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:54.360
let's go to the store is not we go to the store right let's go to the store

01:55:54.360 --> 01:56:01.400
right now you're outside of the indicative mood so that's what's going on you lengthen those vowels and all of

01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:09.320
a sudden you're in la la land you're in the world of possibilities conditionals oh if we had

01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:15.840
done something we would have been happy right some kind of conditional it's a

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.920
fake World perfect okay um give me now these sentences I want to run over some

01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:27.119
sentences look that is the grammar all the grammar from first second and third

01:56:27.119 --> 01:56:32.360
units and I want to give you the first couple first couple of exercises and I

01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:37.880
just want to go through them like I would go through them with you if I were tutoring you personally I would first I

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:41.158
would have you read it in

01:56:45.719 --> 01:56:48.719
greekos

01:56:51.079 --> 01:56:58.840
hon okay okay I would have you read it just like that so be practicing so that you can read out the Greek and then I

01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:06.400
would say okay give me a translation give me a translation the people will

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:17.560
sacrifice to the Gods on the roads in order that they may stop the war Okay

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:26.440
now what's going on with that sentence the first verb the verb of the main Clause is thus it's a third person

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:32.679
singular future active indicative it's future

01:57:32.679 --> 01:57:38.800
future right where's the subject hos the people hos thus the people will

01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:45.679
sacrifice then you get this date of to Theo who are they going to sacrifice to to the gods and where are they going to

01:57:45.679 --> 01:57:52.960
sacrifice you get a prepositional phrase intio on the roads

01:57:52.960 --> 01:58:00.800
on the roads right they got little shrines little shrines to Mercury and he's got a phus sitting there telling

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:06.880
you which direction to go right let's make an offering here I say we burn some

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:13.079
down definitely um and what happens um you get a result Clause at the end of

01:58:13.079 --> 01:58:18.119
this henna henna as you read right because you're reading these these units

01:58:18.119 --> 01:58:26.360
H is with is indicates a Purp purpose Clause purpose clause in order that in

01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:33.280
order that what in order that they may stop Palin the war that's a subjunctive

01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:39.840
look at that Palin that's a subjunctive what kind of subjunctive is that if you

01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:47.159
know the principal parts the first principal part is poo so the root is po

01:58:47.159 --> 01:58:53.079
does that what we have here no we have P plus the ending o in the sub ining osen

01:58:53.079 --> 01:59:02.320
third person plural so what is the pal oh that's the third principal part of pow po

01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:08.760
paloa that is an arist right it's an arist root doesn't have an augment on it

01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:14.679
none of the subjunctives in the arist will have the augments right why because they're

01:59:14.679 --> 01:59:21.199
subjunctive bro that's the way it is okay Palos sin Palos you only give

01:59:21.199 --> 01:59:29.199
augments to indicative modes come on man um Palos sin right Palos sin in order

01:59:29.199 --> 01:59:36.719
that they may stop now um let's get a little bit nerdy and

01:59:36.719 --> 01:59:45.040
say what kind of verb is your is your main verb thus we said it's a present

01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:50.880
present tense right third person singular present active indicative what

01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:56.920
kind of verb is it because it's the present tense it's a primary

01:59:56.920 --> 02:00:05.480
verb your present your future and your perfect are all primary verbs you're

02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:12.440
imperfect your arist and your PL perfect are all secondary verbs you'll notice

02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:18.719
the secondary verbs all have Epsilon augments now why am I telling you that

02:00:18.719 --> 02:00:24.159
because these are two families primary and secondary and when you have a verb

02:00:24.159 --> 02:00:30.560
in your main Clause that is primary tense your purpose Clause following it

02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:37.199
must have a subjunctive when you have a prime when you have a verb in the main Clause that

02:00:37.199 --> 02:00:43.520
is a secondary verb an imperfect an arist or a PL

02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:50.760
perfect your verb in your dependent purpose Clause must be

02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:58.920
optative that's to be in the optative mood so you use subjunctives with present future or

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:07.719
perfect and you use optative following imperfect arist and pl perfect

02:01:07.719 --> 02:01:15.960
primary and secondary verbs they call that establishing primary sequence and

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:22.719
secondary sequence why because classical philologists are nerds right and they have to have some kind of offic language

02:01:22.719 --> 02:01:28.800
that pushes their science along okay so that is the first sentence if you're

02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:37.320
going to analyze that sentence I want you to see you've got a main clause and you've got a purpose Clause that is a

02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:43.679
dependent clause following it it depends upon what came before it it hangs on

02:01:43.679 --> 02:01:49.719
what came before it right okay good Fantastic look at number two we've put

02:01:49.719 --> 02:01:55.199
our purpose Clause up front hos ton poon

02:01:55.199 --> 02:02:02.000
P right you see that Hos Hos and hna work the same way in a purpose Clause

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:09.040
they just both mean in order in order to or in order that right so we've put our

02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:15.920
purpose Clause up front in order that where's our where's our main Clause

02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:21.520
hos T the th what's our main verb th

02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:27.480
it's a present active indicative third person singular he sheer it sacrifices

02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:36.000
where's our subject hodos that's in the nominative it's got to be the subject the people sacrifice Ty Theo to the gods

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:42.639
who have vaginas those are feminine divinities see the article

02:02:42.639 --> 02:02:48.360
TI remember I told you Theos is a word that can be masculine or feminine the

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:53.840
concept of God I know that when you say God you think

02:02:53.920 --> 02:03:00.960
dude right the oldest uses of Theos are feminine they you said God to them and

02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:06.960
they thought this is the lady that gives you birth isn't that glorious imagine if

02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:13.159
you worshiped a God that was your mother seriously right and not only that but

02:03:13.159 --> 02:03:19.840
just like edus found out she is sexy yeah she a sexy

02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:25.719
mama wo what are you going to do what are you going to do it's going to change

02:03:25.719 --> 02:03:31.599
the way you look at people it's going to change the respect that you have for people and people that you don't respect

02:03:31.599 --> 02:03:37.000
it's going to give you more respect for those people stop being a dumb misogynist it's only because your

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:43.320
religion is monest that you're a misogynist oh God takes so long the

02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:52.360
people sacrifice to the gods H in order that PO they might stop tonon the War

02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:58.400
excuse me did I say might I meant May and why did I mean May because I should

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:04.440
be using the right sequence what is my main verb th it's a present I have to

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:11.000
I'm in primary sequence I've got to have what do I have to have I have to have a subjunctive following primary sequence

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:18.239
and I'm going to translate that subjunctive as May in order that they may stop the war good give me the next

02:04:18.239 --> 02:04:24.719
set I'm going to go through these quick and I want you to do this this so you can play it back to yourself and you

02:04:24.719 --> 02:04:30.800
know if you haven't done these yet or if you have you can correct them this ways too this way too but look at number

02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:38.559
three let's read it in Greek Angelus exas

02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:48.079
hoos um where's our main Clause here let's look for verbs do you see any

02:04:48.079 --> 02:04:53.239
verbs I see Epson right up front Okay that's a nice indicative looking verb

02:04:53.239 --> 02:04:59.239
that looks like an arys third person plural indicative active to me it does

02:04:59.239 --> 02:05:05.119
it does so okay I'm just going to translate my verb then my main verb epon

02:05:05.119 --> 02:05:10.480
they sent they sent now okay let me keep reading is there any are there any

02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:16.719
subjects here for the they yeah there are hooi the strangers that is in the

02:05:16.719 --> 02:05:23.119
nominative case it's got to be the sub the they of the verb The Strangers sent

02:05:23.119 --> 02:05:29.559
Angelus Messengers where' they send them ex auras out of the

02:05:29.559 --> 02:05:36.679
aura now we get our purpose Clause hopos because guess what hos and hopos all

02:05:36.679 --> 02:05:44.520
mean in a purpose clause in order that so what why did The Strangers send

02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:51.719
these Messengers out of the augra in order that they Lucan what is that that

02:05:51.719 --> 02:05:58.480
that is an arist optative arist optative why is it

02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:05.199
optative because in a purpose Clause if the main verb is in the

02:06:05.199 --> 02:06:11.760
secondary is a secondary verb or in secondary sequence and is this one yeah

02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:18.480
because what is it what is it Epson it's an arist that's secondary so

02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:25.840
we're going to have to have the optative and we're going to translate it as in order that they might not that they may

02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:31.520
but in order that they might as soon as you start talking about something in the past you're gonna have to switch from

02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:37.760
May to M good that's isn't that nice teaching teaching ourselves proper

02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:44.440
English too that's nice okay um so they sent those Messengers out of the

02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:52.880
marketplace right The Strangers did in order that they might dissolve the peace

02:06:52.880 --> 02:07:00.599
in order that they might break the peace good look at number four now this is essentially the same look what we got up

02:07:00.599 --> 02:07:07.159
front we've got the same direct object on Gus those Messengers and then epimp

02:07:07.159 --> 02:07:13.400
what is that that's an imperfect that's an imperfect and we know it's first person singular or third

02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:19.400
person plural so we can try both right let's try third person plural they sent

02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:24.440
Messengers Petty t around the island hos

02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:31.760
in order that may Lu in order that

02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:40.599
they excuse me o o o which one is that that's second

02:07:40.599 --> 02:07:48.679
person plural in order that you might not destroy the peace in order that you

02:07:48.679 --> 02:07:54.559
plural you all might not destroy the piece good do you see how that's working

02:07:54.559 --> 02:08:01.360
your your sentence is talking to itself and when you have dependent clauses

02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:08.040
they're going to be talking to the main clause and saying oh wait the main Clause is all the way in the past so I'm

02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:13.880
gonna shift to that same region and I'm going to turn myself into an optative

02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:21.960
and I'm gonna say in order that you might not that you may good look at number five again we can put the

02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:29.800
purpose Clause right up front hna Loman right in order that we may destroy

02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:36.800
we uh here release let's try release here in order that we may release Homer

02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:43.159
P oh what is that it's a third person plural perfect

02:08:43.159 --> 02:08:52.119
they have sent gifts right they have sent gifts in order that we

02:08:52.119 --> 02:08:57.239
May release Homer and you say wait a minute they have sent that sounds like

02:08:57.239 --> 02:09:06.320
it's in the past it's not they have sent is in the present right now at this point in time

02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:11.639
they are in a state of having sent they already sent

02:09:11.639 --> 02:09:17.639
it but we're talking about the present right the perfect tense is actually

02:09:17.639 --> 02:09:25.719
referring to present time so is the future going to be surprised so is the future the future is just a possibility

02:09:25.719 --> 02:09:33.040
it's that which has not yet come to pass but possibly will right it's kind of a

02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:40.119
weird way it's that which is about to be you see they look at the future they call the future in Greek the that which

02:09:40.119 --> 02:09:47.239
is mellow or melis that which is about to happen right

02:09:47.239 --> 02:09:54.800
constantly you are if you're referring to the Future you are in a St of referring to what is

02:09:54.800 --> 02:10:00.760
about right what is about to happen what is potentially there that can happen

02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:09.280
that's where you are right but that's a present time you're just in the present there there is no future right they said

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:17.440
the future is never actually happens that's why it's the future if it actually happened it wouldn't be the

02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:23.719
future do you understand oh love it love it okay let's get one more couple of

02:10:23.719 --> 02:10:29.079
sets of exercises love doing this yep give me the next one this is numbers 8 n

02:10:29.079 --> 02:10:34.159
and 10 I just want you to see I'm going to read it to you real quick tus men and

02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:39.520
I want you to notice there's a Min here and a de that follows it near the end of

02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:46.800
the first line second to last word death in Greek when you you don't really translate the men and the death the men

02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:53.559
is there telling you I've got one thing on this side and the de is telling you and I've got another thing on this side

02:10:53.559 --> 02:11:01.040
the Greeks ancient Greeks love to make constant comparisons and contrast they

02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:07.840
love to contrast and compare right on the one hand so that's why in English we usually translate this on the one hand

02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:14.599
something happens on the other hand something else happens on the one hand men on the other hand death right so

02:11:14.599 --> 02:11:22.079
what does he say here um on the one hand the gods did not guard

02:11:22.079 --> 02:11:27.360
the eyes of Homer okay on the one hand the gods

02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:37.280
didn't guard the eyes of Homer on the other hand right they have well guarded the

02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:43.760
books of homer which are about the virtue of people right about human

02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:50.159
virtue yeah so on the one hand they didn't guard his eyes which is a terrible joke because Homer was

02:11:50.159 --> 02:11:56.520
supposedly blind right so on the one hand they didn't guard his eyes on the other hand right

02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:03.760
they very well have have have guarded his uh his work his actual works his

02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:09.480
songs right and we got another men and dead number nine on the one hand what

02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:17.199
eluc son eluc son yeah on the one

02:12:17.199 --> 02:12:22.559
hand they what what are we going to do how are we going to do this

02:12:22.559 --> 02:12:29.520
Luc what is that is that from the what verb is that from luo let me see Lu luo

02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:34.719
elusa leuca oh look it's got

02:12:34.719 --> 02:12:42.599
lukai right um uh plus and it's augmented right so on the one hand they

02:12:42.599 --> 02:12:50.599
had um dissolved the piece by means of some kind of speech or word right logo

02:12:50.599 --> 02:12:56.239
on the other hand they did not do it ooh it's just got the negative they didn't

02:12:56.239 --> 02:13:03.360
do itoy indeed in word in spirit they did it but

02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:09.760
in deed they didn't do you see how that men in the de is working and the de you

02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:16.920
can just put the de there and it's assumed that you're going to be using this very same verb the very same verb

02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:26.840
look at that beautiful beautiful beautiful PL perfect of luo El Luan third person plural they had

02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:33.639
released right they had they had okay look at number 10 now I wanted to give

02:13:33.639 --> 02:13:40.199
you this one because this is a question it's a question and what is the word that indicates it's a question ARA do

02:13:40.199 --> 02:13:45.880
you translate ARA no ARA is just telling you uh I'm a question now can you ask a

02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:51.960
question without having a in Greek yes yes you can

02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:59.280
right and you'll always you'll never be uncertain about this thanks to the editors right the this isn't in the

02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:06.840
original ancient Greek but thanks to the Byzantine editors we get things like the semicolon for the question mark so see

02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:14.800
the semicolon at the end of that sentence that's a question mark and it's because some stinky Byzantine Garian

02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:21.119
monk who's who's under ging stank cuz he

02:14:21.119 --> 02:14:27.559
never washed them um you know because they didn't know B Byzantine monks always stink you have to understand that

02:14:27.559 --> 02:14:33.040
why do you think they go out in the desert right okay anyway um you thought

02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:38.679
it was a mental thing no um

02:14:42.119 --> 02:14:46.960
a h there's our purpose Clause

02:14:47.159 --> 02:14:56.239
h p right it's a question right so graes grapes what is that

02:14:56.239 --> 02:15:04.000
that's our verb that's our verb main clause and what is it it's from grafo grao it's a

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:14.280
future from the second principal part second person singular will you write pent bibl five

02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:21.800
books Pon about the sacrifices to to the Gods

02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:27.920
H in order that now jump to your verb in order that what pimpo men pimpo men what

02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:33.559
do we get there we get a present subjunctive a present subjunctive third

02:15:33.559 --> 02:15:39.760
person uh first person plural present subjunctive why do we get a present

02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:47.480
subjunctive um because our aspect is continuous right and we have to have a

02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:55.599
subjunctive because our main verb grap is a primary verb it's in primary

02:15:55.599 --> 02:16:01.119
sequence right so following a future we're going to need a subjunctive and

02:16:01.119 --> 02:16:07.480
we're going to translate in order that somebody may not might in order that

02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:14.480

02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:20.400
present or future might past think of it that way okay good good good good now

02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:25.599
when we get to the the sub independent subjunctives or subjunctives of

02:16:25.599 --> 02:16:31.880
potential um we're going to get there'll be a little bit confusion there because we're we're g to translate a verb as

02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:38.518
both may and might it's going to get a little confusing a little confusing okay
