under a is pindar's pithi and O number four and that

00:23:55.679 --> 00:24:00.840
is a Pres a preserved Oracle from

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:08.279
Antiquity given by the great medwa media the one we call Media it was given by

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:14.960
her and she said within a certain number of generations this dude is going to go to this place and he's going to found a

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:20.679
colony and he that was handed down to the delic Oracle this is all historical

00:24:20.679 --> 00:24:28.960
there is no myth this is historical recording

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:36.120
via which is cool via the oracles people think the oracles were song and dance because everybody here and here's the

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:42.080
whip for everybody tonight everybody is bad

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:50.080

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.520
see here is is that pindar's piy and OD preserves this

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:41.240
vocabulary um and it does so in a kind of an elegant Way by preserving the Oracle you thought history started with

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.720
Herodotus right you thought oh he's the first dude to sit down dude and write

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:52.120
out his stuff and say it on the porch of the temple he'd be Dude tell his stories

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:33.480
top one so his logic would be like circular it it may cause a little in his brain you know what I mean

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:40.520
just a little like like a some some circuits we just like nope overheated

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:47.640
boom love it go back to the passage what does she do she Christ him with that

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:54.119
Ambrosia and she inspires him and then we get this fine this last uh oh and it

00:39:54.119 --> 00:40:03.119
says o as if he is the Son of

00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:09.400
God as if he is the Son of God what is she doing she's crising him

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:18.800
with Ambrosia as you do with the sons of God and there were in those

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:27.520
days the sons of God and the daughters of men and the sons of God because they had

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:35.760
had their mortality burned away yeah they taught those Daughters of

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:42.480
men they taught them how with the drugs that's what it says Enix says anyway

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:47.640
love it let's go back do you see how it works now is everybody getting it nah

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:55.400
right people are always riding to me saying oh now this makes sense did you know X Y and Z exactly right Clicks in

00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:03.839
as soon as you see the reality of the text and the anthropology of the culture that that thing is submerged in oh God

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:09.440
it just it's glorious but then we get this last phrase so she christs him with the

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:16.119
Ambrosia as a Son of God and she inspires him with this sweetness and

00:41:16.119 --> 00:41:23.839
then she has or possesses him in her

00:41:23.839 --> 00:41:29.200
culo now cpose colpos is an interesting word and here

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:36.560
it's in the plural what does she do while she's crising him um she has

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:42.560
him in her plural cpos and what is the what does the cpos mean here the

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:48.880
definition um we're gonna get back to that one don't worry what is the cpost definition here look at this no that's

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:56.560
this one that's nope not above that no oh yep that's it that's it a bosom or

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:28.599
you have we entered a sacred place because that's the only we got got to step back for a

00:42:28.599 --> 00:42:34.440
minute got to step back what does that mean there it says especially and then

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:39.920
there's a word probably I don't know maybe that word will get me thrown off

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:45.920
uh uh YouTube so maybe I can't say it beep it out myself but biologically it's

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:52.559
the vagina right you have a penis on the mail you have a vagina you didn't know this was educational T night did you you

00:42:52.559 --> 00:42:59.920
have a penis if you're a male and you have a vagina and those are um organs you used in reproduction and various

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:07.559
activities that are involve bakic ritual and celebration and sometimes the

00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:13.400
consumption of of uh communion between two

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:19.079
people yeah interesting there it is blow it up and look who the source is on the

00:43:19.079 --> 00:43:23.599
end the source is a guide name

00:43:24.119 --> 00:43:29.960
soranus now that's his name really he's writes about Gynecology he should have

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:36.480
changed his name if anybody needed to change his name it was Sor anus give me that one look at this here's the verb

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:42.240
here fromes and I want you to notice look what they've done now this is a level

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:48.040
that um this is at a level that we can start to appreciate as Greek students

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:54.680
look at the last two letters it's Sigma and Kappa right whenever you have that Sigma and Kappa attached to a verb like

00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:00.720
that it means something special give me the next slide look what happens to it

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:06.319
um she's not just christing him she's christing him with an

00:44:06.319 --> 00:44:13.440
iterative an iterative yeah yeah um Homer and herius use them right and this

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:19.200
is a homeric hymn so it only makes sense right and um what are those all about

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:24.839
look at the end of the second line they denote a customary or repeated past

00:44:24.839 --> 00:44:31.480
action it is customary to Christ this is what they do in the right

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:38.359
people that kid is being exposed you know what that kid is doing that kid is screaming right the kid's not sitting

creating that transformation if she hadn't stopped the

00:49:04.119 --> 00:49:13.000
process that boy would have understood who he was he would have seen

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:20.200

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:23.960
intelligent people across the Atlantic in the across the pond who were

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:31.520
sitting there and um following the Traditions that the Brits made with the

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:36.760
Oxford Greek Lexicon the lsj Alice have

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:42.119
those people there and what do they say they're they're him and Han baby why do

00:53:42.119 --> 00:53:49.960
we have to say one thing is another just come out and say what it is it's too Victorian Purge the Victorian blood you

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:56.839
people in England this is for those you know when I was in Newcastle and that group of

00:53:56.839 --> 00:54:03.280
Saucy ladies of the evening came surrounded me pinched my cheeks um this

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:08.400

pastes that's their way of getting around saying well tell me what is a pastes then I'll play your little game

00:54:22.799 --> 00:54:29.040
it's a lover of boys mostly in a bad

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:37.359
sense don't does it sound like a dictionary that you would read in the

past the Christ who is in the position of opening the

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:18.520
eyes that Christ is the pederast this is a direct

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:24.480
link between the definition the classical definition of a

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:31.920
Pedas and the performance of the Christ mystery yes now why is this remember she

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:38.480
D is a kuros what does she do she nourishes the

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:43.720
kuros and sexuality is part of the

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:50.000
process because she is the pyop she is the one who expresses the

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:56.799
love for the kol Ross oh okay the great mother right

centuries oh God this is there's 1500 years before this when these rights are being performed right before

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:21.400
Christianity before Moses was ever a figment in the imagination of the

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:27.599
helenistic um person who created her the helenistic author who created him sorry

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:43.480
gonna switch gears now I'm gonna I'm gonna stop with what I showed you and I just because this is making such a

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:52.119
splash I want to um reinforce this because this is one of the points that I bring up that have gotten people just

00:56:52.119 --> 00:56:57.760
crazy mad and you love it you love it don't you you love it it but um

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:03.000
apparently there's a lot of people who are very upset at the idea that the

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:10.200
Torah the Jewish holy writings were originally written in Greek apparently that's a that's you know it's quite

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:15.760
undercutting to the whole narrative right it takes Moses and Abraham and it

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:22.520
turns them into fictional characters from the 3D Century that are using the

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:30.000
culture of the mystery to create a monest reform of

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.640
religion yeah AKA Judaism 3rd Century BC

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:41.440

00:58:04.039 --> 00:58:09.440
the Hebrew translation of the Greek is right tonight they're making up words

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:15.440
just to be able to suit Greek right it's hilarious watch this this is Genesis

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:20.799
this is Genesis chapter 11 yeah a and what's happening we're

00:58:20.799 --> 00:58:26.880
around the time of you know we're looking at Babel right right uh oh God

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:36.240
and a man said to his neighbor de get over here P soman pus let's fire some

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:41.440
Bricks now watch this people let's fire some bricks just think about that just

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:48.039
think about that simple little statement let us fire some

00:58:48.039 --> 00:58:54.200
bricks okay cool because they're going to build something there's nothing there's nothing look what the Greek does

00:58:54.200 --> 00:59:00.440
look what the Greek does look at the end of the second sentence pman and then the beginning of the third

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:08.039
sentence pen thus do you notice that those have the same rooting them the Greek loves to do this and has been

00:59:08.039 --> 00:59:13.960
doing it for a long time by the time this document comes up and because this

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:20.520
is helenistic the helenistic Greeks were trying especially who associated with the museum they were trying to kind of

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:26.480
elevate the Greek back to what it was right they're trying to they're bring a

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:33.760
lot of vocabulary that's highly highly specific but they're also stylistically trying to hearken back to that old

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:40.440
fashioned way of doing Greek where you take two words put them right next to each other that have the same root

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:46.359
usually one is a verb and one is a noun or an adjective right it's just the way it's

00:59:46.359 --> 00:59:51.559
just what they like to do dude it's their style right and so you PL theum

00:59:51.559 --> 00:59:57.520
and you you prepare a brick or fire a brick and what do you find firing pus

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:03.599
those bricks right oh what just tell me what

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:09.319
do the Hebrew do with this what does the Hebrew do with this watch this people the fact that people can say the Greek

01:00:09.319 --> 01:00:14.960
is a translation of the Hebrew is a total joke this a total joke look at the first word up here I just do the the

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:21.520
making of the bricks right leban leban let's see what that is

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:26.720
what's see are they by the way uh um are the bricks related here right is the

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:32.720
baking related let's see let's see if it's from this what's going on how what kind of terms are they using to

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:40.920
translate this right look at to make a brick or to be made or to make wider

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:47.280
okay so the Hebrews using a word for the baking of the bricks that's a primitive root to become

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:54.720
white okay okay um to make bricks are they doing the

01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:04.039
thing where you've got the same let's see what happens the same base give me the next one so um what is the word for Brick

01:01:04.039 --> 01:01:11.200
wait a minute leban you mean this thing just like the Greek is using the same

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:19.039
root this thing Labon which means to be white but also a brick which by the way

01:01:19.039 --> 01:01:26.760
who seriously seriously you guys I I know you don't I I I know you know this

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:32.079
is not the best work I know you do look at this look at the linguistic laziness

01:01:32.079 --> 01:01:37.880
give me the next one this is terrible whoever is doing this they need to be they need to be told you know take a

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:43.520
look at how classical philology works right now what's a problem here so it

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:50.760
does have the same root the brick and the brick making but look what happens the word for rock that he's about to use

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:56.960
it also has the same root and it means a stone

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:05.119
okay okay what's going on now we've us we've used three um words with one root

01:02:05.119 --> 01:02:10.680
in them what is going on H what's it mean at the

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:16.920
bottom what is the word for stone it's the word for it's used for a charm wait

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:23.880
what Cornerstone death oh my God this is a madeup word

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:29.640
look at how many places they plugged look at how many holes in the wall they plugged with it differing weights

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:37.319
hailstones Jeweler you know there's about 50 words in Greek in there right lapis lazuli a plum line a plum what

01:02:37.319 --> 01:02:43.240
what is it a brick is it a rock is it a plum line am I Charmed is this witch G to hit me in the head with a brick or

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:50.880
something where am I what you're seeing here is one language inventing itself in

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:58.000
order to translate another and that's the secret of Greek in Hebrew Hebrew is

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.520
an attempt ancient Hebrew not modern ancient Hebrew is an

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:12.319
attempt to translate Greek it's an attempt to legitimize itself through the

01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:20.799
Behemoth that was there dominating with its 1.5 million over

01:03:20.799 --> 01:03:26.160
8,000 it's the history of the world man and it's gorgeous you see this is the

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:31.240
one point there's one point I can make out there tonight it's that we look at

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:37.240
history through the wrong um with the wrong direction you know we look at it

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:42.680
the wrong way we should have been looking at the languages we should have been looking at

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:50.240
the languages because the languages preserve that reality and this is the reality that's here ancient Greek has

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:57.279
the close you're right you're right Jesus Christ SI Jesus 6 chist six I

01:03:57.279 --> 01:04:02.559
don't know what that means I don't know what that means it's scaring me go to

01:04:02.559 --> 01:04:09.279
the next one go to the next one here's here look another brick another title that's fine go to the go to the next one

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:16.680
there's the word for burning I was going to talk about that a little bit that's okay I I don't I don't need to the point has been made go to go to right here

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:23.279
here's the um by the way there was there was something in this process of making the bricks you got to have some kind of

01:04:23.279 --> 01:04:29.960
stickiness put them together right some kind of mortar to put them together and the grece says you got

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:37.640
asaltos right wait asaltos does that sound familiar yeah it

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:45.640
does what is it it's asphalt by tuman kind of petroleum it's pitch Right comes

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:51.760
from spallow the very word from it comes from a Greek word and it's just got the alpha privet on the front swall to

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:59.680
deteriorate and a would be to be not deteriorating not being destroyed it's

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:05.240
asalt now give me what the how does the Hebrew come off give me the next one and

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:11.200
I just want you to see look at this chart people this is all the different um this is asphalt with all the

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:18.079
different manifestations of it look at how common this word is in ancient right

01:05:18.079 --> 01:05:23.400
that includes Co look at how common it is look at how many different it's got

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:29.039
holy maate all comes did some say

01:05:30.279 --> 01:05:35.640
trial love that stuff you know that stuff there's a well oh never mind you

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:40.920
Brits will get that give the next one they didn't say I was smart that's the

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:47.520
point watch this people what does he do what does this word mean what does this

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:53.520
Hebrew word mean that they're translating as asalto for Umar right and

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:59.240
what did they say it's bin that's is B tumin is the Roman word for

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:07.799
asaltos right and then they just put asphalt are you kidding me are you

01:06:07.799 --> 01:06:14.200
kidding me yeah this is amazing people right

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:19.960
right in the definition you want to know where this word comes from there's two classical words there to explain it to

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:28.640
you and it's being used for centuries before the Bible is ever

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:36.119
written now people like Dan will tell you Dan and Kip they will tell

01:06:36.119 --> 01:06:41.720
you um there's a wall of separation between Christians and everybody else

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:49.319
and these words will not come across right oh God right this is why they don't make

01:06:49.319 --> 01:06:56.240
classicist here's one last example I just want to throw this to you um look at verse seven come on now

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:02.720
let's go down and what let's confound their tongue let's

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:10.760
confound their tongue it's in the singular right everybody Strokes for everyone says God this is God right he's

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:18.400
pissed that humans are cooperating right so you know that's never good so

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:25.720
they can't hear each other they can't hear their own voices let's go down and sunen them their tongue and what do that

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:32.920
mean to Sun cat old people just look at this third line down to pour together to co-mingle or to confound now you think

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:39.799
that sounds odd like an odd group to be putting together they have a word that means to kind of bring

01:07:39.799 --> 01:07:45.880
together and in doing so to confound you know what an epileptic seizure is it's

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:53.880
when your timing is all brought together it's when those nerves start firing off in unison you get a little storm in the

01:07:53.880 --> 01:08:00.279
brain and that's an epileptic easier right oh God do you understand

01:08:00.279 --> 01:08:07.839
what they're grasping now watch this Give me the give me the uh next one which is the Hebrew um here's look those

01:08:07.839 --> 01:08:13.880
are those three words now watch this hit that definition here's a Hebrew word which oh

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:20.159
my God happens to me mean exactly the same thing that an already established

01:08:20.159 --> 01:08:24.440
Greek word is meant for centuries

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:38.400
what are you looking at you were looking at proof that Hebrew is constructed around

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:46.400
Greek did you hear that did you hear that oh this will make them so mad this

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:52.560
will make everybody so mad don't you love it it's gorgeous

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:59.238
isn't it we're creating words now that are the exact mirrors right we're taking

01:08:59.239 --> 01:09:04.480
culture and why is that because this is the culture that the Jewish people or

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:13.120
person we don't know how many authors there were it doesn't say right that the Jewish people who created the

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:19.400
Torah um those people were trying to um

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:25.480
borrow from the power of the Greek language they were harnessing that power

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:31.318
to bring it in to create and that's why it's in the beginning where Gaia and

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:39.758
uros right two Gods two helenistic creation Gods right up top it's the

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:45.120
language of Greek that is the origin of the Hebrew

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:51.040
Bible yeah give me the last one this is gorgeous um this is silliness look what

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:56.280
happens oh look what they do they start talking about Arabic

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:03.960
Arabic right well in Arabic this root means this and right because they want some sort of Semitic connection right

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:11.360
and you would think if you look up what's where where's the oldest Arabic from um they'll say oh 8th Century 8th

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:16.600
Century BC oh really show me what does it say oh no no no no no it doesn't

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:22.320
exist then we don't have any surviving right we just think they wrote are you

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:31.360
kidding um are you joking me when is the first written Arabic it's in the 500s

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.719
anod Domin do you see what the linguists were

01:10:36.719 --> 01:10:42.320
doing this is incompetence this is complete

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:48.920
incompetence but it is driven by a powerful desire just like you have the

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:57.080
numerologist it's driven by an extreme desire to justify

01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:03.560
the language itself to say look this language is legitimate and the claims the text make

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:11.040
or legitimate right it's an attempt to create legitimacy wow but it's a creation

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:16.640
nonetheless the sacred Hebrew is attempting to reflect the

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:22.719
Greek of the original isn't that gorgeous okay let's um let's round this

01:11:22.719 --> 01:11:29.880
