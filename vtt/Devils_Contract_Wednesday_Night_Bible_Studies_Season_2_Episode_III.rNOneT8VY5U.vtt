with marvelous Deeds Sir John of Salisbury says that when God permits

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.340
witches can with the help of demons shake the elements together and alter

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.180
the true appearance of things this is quantum magic this is not fairy

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:05.580
tale magic this is quantum Magic they can foretell much of the future

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.699
can anybody smell where we're going this is fantastic they confused the Mind

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:18.060
of Men with dreams oh and by the way these witches aren't

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:25.639
all female as he's about to say these are men that we might call a mage

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.259
yeah okay yes and merely by the potency of their

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:38.000
charms drugs can cause death Etc

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.259

north practiced unheard of Wonders with various illusions

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:03.120
yeah what kind of Illusions and could so skillfully deceive men's eyes that they

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.699
hid their own features and those of others on various phantasms you have

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:16.139
just stepped into Pythagoras okay this is not medieval Magic

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.660
this is ancient Magic yeah ancient

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:28.220
quantum physics the manipulation of thought

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.020
the visibility the rearrangement

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.600
in order to create okay

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.680
here's where we are we're Landing here okay can you can we just tell us a couple more things here yeah and um they

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:54.120
obscure the the true shape of things yeah they did other marvels of those which we have already told of Simon

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.120
Marcus thanks thanks okay yeah I get it I see where we're going Pythagoras made

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.400
his thigh appear to be golden why would he do that

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.520
and by his spells tamed an eagle with which he often conversed oh yes of

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:19.380
course right he's one of those that talks with the eagle fantastic

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:25.080
yeah okay so here's what I would like you to do

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.740
um Mr witch hunter could you please tell me

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:37.199
what is this thing that we call The Pact with the

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:43.740
Devil what what where is it it's because I think it's

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:50.180
with Jesus I think so tell us

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:58.699
the packs formed between a witch and the devil may be either expressed or tacit

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:04.740
the expressed pact and by the way for those of you who are in a legal language Department

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:11.220
watch keep an eye on this the expressed pact consists of a solemn

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:18.379
vow of fidelity and homage made Fidelity and homage

00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:23.400
yes proskinesis bending the knee

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:31.080
yeah okay in the presence of witness

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:36.440
and what we we have witnesses right

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:42.599
it's to the devil visibly present in some bodily form

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:48.180
that is an expressed Pact yes

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:54.899
expressed now the tacit Pact for those of you who choose that path

00:08:54.899 --> 00:09:04.260
involves the offering of a written petition to the devil and may be done by proxy

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:12.120
proxy what is a proxy yeah someone endowed with that Authority

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:18.660
okay through whom that deal can be made through a witch male or female

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:25.260
or some third person when the Contracting party is afraid to see or to

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:32.519
have speech with the devil are you afraid to talk to the devil how many of you have talked to the devil I sent you

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:42.540
to the devil right okay Brian calls this a tacit Pact

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:50.180
yet although it is made with another person than the devil it is expressly made in the devil's name

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:57.300
important contractual as is clear from the examples he gives

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:03.899
perhaps we should class as an Express pact that rather rare insistence of a

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:10.380
German woman who jumping backwards out of the out of her tub said that example

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.600
of a German woman who jumped out of her bathtub and said quote as far

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:23.180
as I thus sleep away from Christ so near may I come to the devil

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:28.740
but there are certain matters common to all their packs with the Devil and these

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:38.360
may be arranged under 11 heads that's a lot of legal lingo

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:44.100
it makes you wonder but this

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:53.100
is what stands between you and the performance of The Magic

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:59.160
a pact tacit

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:09.360
we tacitly make a pact in this Temple where we are awaiting the

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:17.480
return of Lady Babylon we make a pact

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:27.899
first they deny the Christian faith

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:34.500
looks like many of us are there withdraw their allegiance from God

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:40.079
anybody out there withdrew Your Allegiance they've repudiate the

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:48.420
protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary keeping the vilest insults upon her and

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:57.839
calling her harlot and the devil arrogates honor to himself

00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:03.600
as Augustine notes boom there's your Source you smell that whiff

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:09.420
Augustine always look at who the sources are when

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:15.240
you're casing this crime scene and you're working in the direction of

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.240
showing someone of bringing someone so that they can see

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:29.120
that their religion and their morality are built upon a pedophile

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.040
a child raping pedophile

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:40.320
yeah who are the sources here it's Augustine that's who he's

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:45.540
digging up so if we want to put ourselves into his Lane you can see it as it builds in

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:51.120
history [Music]

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:57.000
therefore Saint hippolytus the Martyr writes that the devil compels them to

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.040
say quote I deny the creator of Heaven and Earth isn't that fascinating

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:11.279
there is Uranus and Gaia once again

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:16.620
can you swim those channels in that cave no you're gonna follow Some solid rope

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:23.660
through that dark cave to the other side yeah or you're gonna die

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.160
yeah so follow the Rope reason right gets us there

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:34.680
I deny the creator of Heaven and Earth I deny my baptism I deny the worship I

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:41.639
formally paid to God I cleave to thee and in thee I believe

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:45.259
how many of you have done that

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:54.360
from my conversations with you

00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:00.360
um many of you are beyond that already

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:07.880
you've already made a pact with the Devil you didn't realize it

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:14.459
yeah nice nice second

00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:22.519
he bathed them in a new mock baptism

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:31.260
do you remember where the launch pad is the launch pad in the son of God's

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:38.899
Ministry is the baptism of John

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:47.279
John V and if you'll notice

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:52.740
he cracked open Uranus

00:14:52.740 --> 00:15:00.380
yeah the Greek is very explicit it's ripped apart

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:07.820
through which this Spirit comes

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:14.660
and compels him into thee

00:15:16.579 --> 00:15:23.459
solitary confinement where he is

00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:30.000
approached by the master himself

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.399
yeah the ruler who sits upon the throne the

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:40.980
bringer of dawn with let those of you with ears to hear

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:48.779
hear yes we sit upon the throne because of The Mark

00:15:48.779 --> 00:15:56.060
of Cain yeah yeah

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:07.339
third they forswear their old name and are given a new one

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:17.519
then example is given fourth he makes them deny their Godfathers and godmothers

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:24.420
both of baptism and Confirmation

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:31.560
and assigns them fresh ones we all get new names isn't that nice

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.600
fifth they give the devil some piece of their clothing

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.480
for the Devil is an eager is eager to make them his own in every particular

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:49.380
of their spiritual Goods he takes their faith and baptism

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:57.000
right you had that stripped at the door when you came in here you know you know

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.420
yeah

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:11.480
of their bodily Goods he claims just their blood

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:22.500
as in the sacrifices to Baal if you're going to perform the magic

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:29.160
if you're going to crack open Uranus and enter this place

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.799
yeah you got to be a son of God

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.280
so

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:49.320
the pigment how are the Pigmen doing the one thing the Pigmen learn

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:55.980
is they learn the respect of the queen all right this is a place for lady

00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:01.919
Babylon yeah a holy place

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:07.620
so the Amazonian that now runs the room I hope everything's going well to you

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.720
Cersei hope everything's going well please give people a chance

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:18.120
right give people a chance before you know maybe around with the alabastran

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:25.799
you know what I mean then you know when they go over line there have at it feast

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:31.440
Feast those who don't respect the queen that's what um that's what happens you end up

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.200
getting eaten which must be a marvelous thing to do publicly

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:43.200
publicly can you imagine eating not running down somebody and

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:51.019
and turning them into some sort of kebab

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:59.940
yeah yeah it's uh yeah um third uh uh fourth he makes them deny

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:06.600
their Godfathers yes fifth give the devil some piece of clothing in the baptism six they swear allegiance to the

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:12.660
Devil Within a circle yeah they swear Legions to the Devil

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:19.380
Within a circle yes hail Satan right hail Satan

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:26.280

it's not me I'm just the proxy right authorized to bring this to you

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:40.949
by saying Isidore at Corp [Laughter]

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:48.539
um seventh they pray the devil to strike them out of The Book of Life

00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:54.299
and to inscribe them in the book of death you didn't realize there was a

00:19:54.299 --> 00:20:01.140
difference did you yeah no because this is not something they play up when we talk about the book

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:07.140
of life and there are a few of you out there who will know what the book of

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:13.020

during the Bible studies and we also need to talk about Victoria's Secret

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:43.140

and sometimes it's in certain places it you know it's

00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:49.799
a little on men

00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:59.100

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:24.539
will go into a community and pick up certain people that are suspected of

00:25:24.539 --> 00:25:30.360
certain things using certain substances magic it's the

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:36.419
sorcerers you know what I mean those those people are dangerous yeah

00:25:36.419 --> 00:25:41.580
um it's been observed by these investigators who by the way you read through the list of these investigators

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:46.799
and it's it's sad because they're all involved in like major slaughterings of

00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:52.080
people this one guy was like 900 the whole group of women and children

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:59.880

the very thing that they're broadcasting right

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:56.460

I'm speaking to allow lady Babylon to feel comfortable

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.059
and remember the templum is a trap it's a place to open up

00:29:27.059 --> 00:29:33.080

what is going on we're with Jesus right after he meets with John and all John's

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:28.940
boys out in the baptizing wilderness that's where we are

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:36.299
and he sees that spirit and that Spirit compels him into the eremon

00:30:36.299 --> 00:30:40.700
into that place of Solitude

00:30:42.659 --> 00:30:48.179
yeah yeah where he's tempted go ahead give me the

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:55.559

on his hair that white Woolen hair there's a reason all of the vocabulary

00:31:46.919 --> 00:31:53.700
is connected yeah look at the context here now we're back in first century okay here we are

00:31:53.700 --> 00:32:00.840

Baptists in the room your Baptists in the room you evangelicals yeah you just know that

00:32:45.539 --> 00:32:52.679
that baptism into death is an ancient mystery now you didn't

00:32:52.679 --> 00:33:00.240
you're part of a fairy tale yeah yeah the original is so much more interesting

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:08.520
it is seriously seriously okay we were in the we were in the aramon with Jesus

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:16.620
after he's with remember John's got these glasses that they use that are called the glass phallus

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:22.440
yeah with the boys right this is Hercules we're there oh

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:31.260
did I tell you that Hercules is always always always associated with a young boy lover just

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:35.000
like Jehovah is

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:41.880
by Joe if you say yeah maybe that's why I kicked out his

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:47.460
wife maybe maybe that's why Jehovah kicked out his wife

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:52.580
it could be cause trouble

00:33:52.620 --> 00:34:01.200

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:06.840
don't have to be smart to see that Jesus's

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:12.000
a perv and a garden that for I know I'm telling them

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.200

00:34:42.599 --> 00:34:49.099
the Christos was raised

00:34:49.099 --> 00:34:55.320
necrron from that place where all the shades are from the dead

00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:01.440
from that place it's analog remember the analog here please don't get lost

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:10.320
yes brilliant yeah and um through the doxa of his father what

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:19.520

to walk in this new life

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:36.240
you are hearing the mystery you're hearing it again we are in a

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.460
death and Resurrection code yes

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:47.820
perhaps like the death and Resurrection Cults that involve the use of drugs and the use of witches

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:54.240
who have to give these drugs to induce the death that guazo is telling us they

00:35:54.240 --> 00:36:00.599
can induce wonderful where is your Mark of Cain

00:36:00.599 --> 00:36:07.320
yeah this is fantastic I love this okay let's keep going back to the text back to the text we're with Jesus right we're

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:12.480

is from onago and you have onago should we bring up onogo yeah look at this

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:35.220
people look at this if it's if you can see it real close real close here yeah to lead up from a lower place right

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:42.119
as opposed to cartago cartago is to push down upon right this one's to lead up

00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:48.599
wait a minute do I smell Resurrection do I smell Resurrection look at number four

bringing up especially from the dead a spouse into the light

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:02.880
it's the transition it's quantum physics from the ancient mind

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:10.079
those of us who bought what the Sybil said about analog we're able to follow

00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:16.200
those of you who don't have ears to hear blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:22.020
yeah okay let's go back to the back to the Greek let's hurry up because the devil's

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:41.339
nights and um the one who's who's doing the trial comes and he says to him if

00:37:41.339 --> 00:37:47.280
you are you know here it is you know we're at Monty Python's Bridge right

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:54.599
if you are the Son of God um it's time to prove it this is formulaic this is formulaic it's no

00:37:54.599 --> 00:38:00.200
different than what you're going to see with Heracles

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:07.200
get your Victoria's Secret get your Victoria's Secret on

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.900
right Heracles needs to stand up are you the son of God

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:18.180
let's see what happens if you're a Son of God what speak you

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:27.500
wanted the magic Here Comes speak so that these rocks become bread

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:40.920
the trans take it down the transmutation

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:47.040
the realigning The Binding that brings

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:56.480
matter transfer is based in frame in mind

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:02.099
wow that that straight up Pythagorean crazy talk

00:39:02.099 --> 00:39:08.160
right totally okay anyway back to our text

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.680
um and then give me the next one and then the devil

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:21.540
um took a hold of him grabbed him by the collar and sent him to the to the um Holy City

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:27.720
and put him on the spire yeah put them on the top put them in the

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:33.300
wings this is what it says depending on the construction be a different part of the

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:41.119
building anyway put him up there Boop transport look what he did transport

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:50.579
yeah transport cross time and space that's gorgeous love it

00:39:50.579 --> 00:39:56.160
and anyway he uh said to him if you're the Son of

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:03.420
God here's number two that was strike one if you're the Son of God by the way for

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:11.520
those of you who realized that we're just reading the Bible right now you'll realize that Satan is indeed in control

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:18.599
Isn't it nice Jesus get gets yanked around question and yanked around

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:24.540
is he worthy of the throne is he a son of God this is what happens when you mingle

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:32.160
with the daughters of men yes it's gorgeous yeah it um yeah go ahead

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:40.320
um if you are the son of God throw yourself down now and then the devil goes on the quote

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:47.940
and he's just using a quote that he would be familiar with because if you are the son of God

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:54.540
then this will happen you won't be able to kill yourself

00:40:54.540 --> 00:41:01.260
you won't give it a shot yeah and Jesus backs again he doesn't

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:08.160
take it strike two right do you see the magic

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:14.700

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:21.660
and then the devil took him to a high mountain and he showed to him

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:31.040
what did he show to him it's on the next one no next one uh yep that's yep we're good

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:39.380
uh look on line number three what did he show him he showed him

00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:46.079
and if you have noted in Greek

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:53.280
a bossy Leia can be a King Dome but it's the same word for

00:41:53.280 --> 00:42:01.440
Queen it's funny yes we don't say Kingdom in Antiquity we don't say King Dome

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:07.320
we say queendom now

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:14.220
please I just want I want to send a message

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:21.180
cross time and space into the mind into the mind of Mary beard

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:30.180
I want her to be wherever she is just maybe she's sleeping probably sleeping right now I want her to wake up

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:38.760
I want you to wake up Mary and I want you to have been here with us and I want you to have seen

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:47.660
the the very power in antiquity has a female root that women were not

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:53.700
staying indoors uh

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:59.280
it's called the queendom not a kingdom for a reason

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:05.400
logically because we have Queens oh well that explains all the ancient Queens

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:10.880
yeah so much for the staying indoors

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:17.640
we can't tolerate garbage here in this Temple

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.299
