tonight we're gonna have to dig deep and uncomfortable I can tell you right off from comments that I've been looking at

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.220
this is not going where you think it is going you see I don't take that common

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.459
path that the religious historian from Yale does I don't take that path

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.620
we're going to go to some sources and look at some of the most hardcore Greek

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.860
on the planet hardcore we're going right into the middle of it but before we do

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.520
it I need to pass on a message the message is I've been talking I've been talking

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.180
to you preachers preachers out there I know in my audience I know

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:41.160
there are several of you preachers who have come out preachers who have seen the light and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.220
died again yes I would love for you to come on the show

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.660
I would appreciate it if you would come on and stand up and give your give your

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.180
thoughts perspective for the rest of us if you were a priest

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.800
or who has lost the faith or if you are a nun who's thrown away the habit

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.800
I would love to talk about your experiences in order to come

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.140
same rules for everybody set for us by Lucian either you cut your hair

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.560
completely off or you present yourself in public to honor Aphrodite

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.860
and how do you do that I think you're adult enough to figure that out

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.080
or you can come on as a challenge for a fight club in which case you just have

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.739
to be wearing beautiful ladies lingerie and a platinum blonde wig

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.280

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.879

Paul uses this Paul uses this expression

00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:46.980
it's our tool of Glory does it make sense for all you seminarians listen up

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:55.860
does it make sense that this would be roughly at the same time as Paul would be writing

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:03.720
now is it stylistically similar that first testament coin a

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:09.418

you ex-pornated what does pornello mean it means to have intercourse

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:59.220
or to engage in religious worship you mean their word for engaging and

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.860
what you and I and people who are part of The Sisterhood and frustration whose

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:13.500
faces will crack at the slightest bit of sexual emotion yes yes do you know what

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:18.840
do you know what they were doing they were worshiping but their word for

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:25.260
worship is the word for intercourse the word for worship is the word for intercourse

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:32.820

Health it is wrapped up in the cosmos if you don't want people to be running out

exposure and you were baptized or dipped or died in the blood and you lived okay

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:23.280
pull up that right away what you just had described to you from the Bible is

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:30.480
the right of the child sacrifice and when I say sacrifice I say Lucia the

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:36.419
burning of the incense that is the Greek sacrifice are they

00:25:36.419 --> 00:25:43.260
killing their children are they killing their children do you really think do you really think

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:50.460
you're going to take all of these new mothers and they're just going to step forward and follow the fairy tale that

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:57.059
Christianity has taught you that there's this great statue of Molech and we take

00:25:57.059 --> 00:26:04.980
our children it burns man the mother comes in they sacrifice to their gods no that's a

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:13.140
fairy tale people he just described to you what the ritual is they are burning off the mortality of a child by

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:19.620
subjecting it to this process of fumigation

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:27.240
do some of the children die in the process yes it's sad to report that some of them do

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:32.940
okay this is not what you've been told

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:40.320

appreciate everybody's attention I'm going to make it in time tonight um yeah and uh so and what happened when

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:53.159
all of this was taking place there's a great evil that was behind it and what

00:26:53.159 --> 00:27:00.900
is that evil um you've built what did you do you built places for for go ahead and bring

a place of prostitution is the Temple of Aphrodite you've built your society

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.900
around this you've built it okay interesting interesting that

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.940
Jehovah is so pissed about Society building

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:33.000
wow that's something perhaps we should all live in a in a tribe somewhere

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.480
right Jehovah's got terrible advice for those of you who haven't finished the Bible Jehovah's advice is always

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.840
terrible and he's the very first liar so oh my god let's bring up that same

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:53.880
text again I'm going to finish it off I just want to make sure at the bottom look at verse 26 and you ex-pornated

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:59.880

the flesh as the Flash I'm gonna cut you to the flash we have

the ancient Greek saying bring it up one more time I'm going to cut you the flesh I want you to look look oh my God it's

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:46.580
that fleshy desire your your sexual desire

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:53.220
is in that organ when you think of that organ

00:28:53.220 --> 00:29:00.059
that organ contains that desire that overwhelming

00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:06.840
drive that's what it contains you went after big meat

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:14.100
literally big meat yeah shame on you I guess I mean good

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:23.340
for her that's the problem when your vocabulary is only 8 000 words long right eh you

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:29.100
know it's like uh it's not big enough you know what I mean it's just not big enough

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:36.000
the devil will tell you the truth the devil will tell you the truth you can see what you see how big it is

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.440
yeah these are the Megalo these are the ones with the big ones right okay fantastic let's go to the

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:49.559
next passage we're getting to the abortion for those of you who are waiting who have come here sickly

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:54.779
looking for the abortion yeah don't ever make an agreement with your neighbors he

00:29:54.779 --> 00:30:01.980
says don't anybody around you don't make because you're going to end up explanating with their gods

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:08.159
and what's going to happen they're going to invite you and you're going to end up going and you're going to end up what

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:15.539
does that last line say you're going to end up eating look at the second to last word Greek students hi maton hi mattone

00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:21.480
oh my God you're gonna end up eating blood you're waiting for the virgin

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:28.760
right you're waiting for her how do we get to the abortion how do we get to the virgin's abortion

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:38.240
we get there through the blood that blood of that virgin savior

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:46.260
that has the power to open your eyes that is what we call the aqua we tie the

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:53.580
Water of Life okay or do you hear the cult right it's through that what are they

00:30:53.580 --> 00:31:00.240
doing what are they doing with that virgin they're administer administering to her

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:06.899
drugs that are verifiable abortifacions a lot of these work by Contracting the

00:31:06.899 --> 00:31:13.620
muscles in the uterus forcefully expelling the fetus

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:21.320
now of course the fetus in ritual with the Virgin doesn't exist yet

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:28.860
we partake of that life essence through the process of drinking her

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:36.260
blood in Ritu fantastic fantastic let's keep going

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:42.779
boom what's the next one fantastic pull that down um I want you to notice I just

00:31:42.779 --> 00:31:49.140
translated translated that as blood and if you will look at the last line of all these translations they will invite you

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:54.179
and you will eat their sacrifices there's no word for sacrifice there

00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:59.279
the New Living Translation and you will go with them with sacrificial meals

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:03.799
you're going to eat sacrificial meals together

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:09.720
interesting well that certainly civilizes it okay what about the third

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:16.679
one you eat the sacrifice now why are they all saying sacrifice because children

00:32:16.679 --> 00:32:25.020
a thousand years ago there was a lie that altered our timeline

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:30.720
and that lie said this is the holy

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:37.440
language of this text only it wasn't the holy language of that text and that text was

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:45.059
the original it's not a translation and I'm about to show you how this can't be a translation are you ready are you

00:32:45.059 --> 00:32:51.539
ready let's go back to the um go ahead hit it yeah um this is why they all say sacrifice

00:32:51.539 --> 00:32:59.640
because they all looked at the LIE the oldest text we have is the Septuagint of the Bible and it is a

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:05.640
native Greek don't believe the fairy tales follow the

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:11.299
evidence ask somebody please from the devil here's the word of the devil

00:33:11.299 --> 00:33:16.740
anybody from a seminary who starts talking to you or from a church who

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:23.100
starts talking to you about the sacred Hebrew ask him how many Hebrew medical texts

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:30.299
are there and when they tell you there are none ask them again bombard them how about

00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:36.539
pharmacology how about astrology how about any of the things that were in the museum there aren't any why because

00:33:36.539 --> 00:33:41.760
they weren't being written and why weren't they being written because the

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:50.480
language was dead the language was dead and had been for many hundreds of years

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:56.039
fantastic let's go back to the living language that captured it that's all I'm

00:33:56.039 --> 00:34:03.600
saying let's go back to what the evidence has for us now you can see why all the people who make such a big deal

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:08.878
out of the Dead Sea Scrolls you see why they do it do you know how many Scrolls

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:16.020
do you know how many pieces of parchment how many pieces fragments that we've got a papyri do you know how many of those

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:21.658
are in Greek for straight up Greek oh my God there's so many that you would drown

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:26.878
if you threw them all in the swimming pool all these papyri fragments you could drown in them

00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:32.158
yes the Dead Sea Scrolls the Dead Sea

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:40.320
Scrolls I'm going to tell you right now there's an entire Museum to them in Israel and yeah and I'm gonna have to

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:48.179
tell you this um they are translations of Greek texts that were with them

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:57.780
oh my goodness somebody was trying to resurrect the liturgical dead language and we because of our position looking

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:04.680
through history think just the opposite we see ourselves as in a mirror we are

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:09.720
the reflection isn't that great we're not isn't that you're not seeing yourself for who you

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:14.820
are you see a reflection let's go to it I love this let's hit the next text hit it

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:22.619
minute drive right we're taking these things back right and what else did they do because you're my haunted yeah you

00:35:22.619 --> 00:35:27.780
yeah what is my my heart oh my heart oh it's translated as to have sex or before

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:35.160
my idolatry wait a minute I thought you said that was what pornello is yes yes

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:40.740
yeah you mean they have two verbs that we have to describe by a whole set of words

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:46.380
that means something about sex and mystery something about sex and the

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:52.500
practice of religion yes and we identify them the same way and you know that's

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:58.560
bad you know that's bad it means our people cannot express what they were

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:04.020
expressing let's go see how these texts are explicitly Greek okay um and what

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:09.480
did you do you you got you got the blood all over your hands right you got the

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:17.599
blood why do they have the hand why do they have the blood in their hands what are they doing with the substance there

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:24.780
you even entered into a union of the things of the Mind the intention the

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:30.780
passion you entered into a union of that and what happened when you did that back

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:37.740
to the text what happened when you did that yeah you you what Diego going you

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:43.560
led your children through the impuron bring up the next through the

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:48.900
imporon look at it take a look at it oh I love

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:54.900
it getting scorched did you ever get scorched did you get the mortality burnt

00:36:54.900 --> 00:37:01.859
off you did you get scorched you see this is not the fairy tale BS this is

00:37:01.859 --> 00:37:08.839
not mothers bringing their children to be killed this is mothers

00:37:08.839 --> 00:37:14.480
participating in a ritual that drives itself

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:20.599
from the midwives this is a process of bringing your baby

00:37:20.599 --> 00:37:26.160
to a place where it can survive and what

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:32.640
are you doing when you're amplifying this child you're introducing this child to the invisible

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:39.780
to the invisible oh my God and if you don't do this to your child don't expect anything

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:47.040
immortal you mean that chemical has that much power you mean that that group of drugs

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:53.220
has that much power you can take a child and you can develop think about that for

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:59.400
a minute people they took their children they're newborn children and they

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:05.579
developed them with drugs sometimes it killed them but you know sometimes the

00:38:05.579 --> 00:38:10.920
oracles died too yeah

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:15.960
yeah sometimes the oracles died too let's see somebody taking this stuff

excuse me on the uh on the cutting

00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:07.680
out of the embryo and on the hooking out

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:13.920
one of these These are both ways to remove go ahead and take it down these are both ways to perform abortions this

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:20.640
is not the type of abortion that we are performing in Ritu in Antiquity this is

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:26.400
the type of abortion that we are performing at the request of women who

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:34.560
need this surgery and they would use embryo tomes what's an embryo Tome it's an instrument for cutting out a fetus

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:42.060
we don't have to worry about that we don't have to worry about that on the

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:48.839
cult side because our abortions on the cult side is there at an early stage of

00:43:48.839 --> 00:43:53.940
development yeah and it's they're chemical abortions the chemicals do for

00:43:53.940 --> 00:44:01.319
us what the instruments do for the midwives and doctors right the chemicals do that for us and

00:44:01.319 --> 00:44:08.640
we're consuming that anyway so um thank yeah interesting let's go to the next one next one that I just want

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:13.920
to give you a glimpse of that abortion abortion yeah fantastic so here's a text

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:19.560
I'm going to flash it up here and then I want you to take it down it'll be our final text for tonight

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:27.359
I want you to see that the title there is Perry Toxic Petty toxic coup

00:44:27.359 --> 00:44:32.640
yes and what is that go ahead and take it down this is on the drug called

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.859
toxicon this is from a Byzantine physician which I know none of you have

00:44:37.859 --> 00:44:43.440
ever read I'm talking to the so-called Scholars now the devil hates you by the way

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:50.819
um yeah he told me this is your punishment I was like are you sure this is the punishment of the scholars he's

00:44:50.819 --> 00:44:59.119
like dude it's my prison right who do you think he hates most he hates the purveyors he hates the sellers most

00:44:59.119 --> 00:45:05.700
fantastic devil has had such high ethical standards it's amazing amazing

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.859
anyway this is from a Byzantine physician you're not going to see him

00:45:10.859 --> 00:45:16.560
repeated elsewhere and I don't believe that there is a translation into English

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:22.920
of Paul a vagina I may be wrong I may be wrong I haven't seen one in years so I'm

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:28.680
gonna have to bring this to you from the Native Greek don't don't be

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:35.420
worried it's pretty straight up sixth Century Greek it's not you know it

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:41.579
difficulty wise it's not too bad and because it has a lot of medical lingo in

00:45:41.579 --> 00:45:48.240
it I've been exposed to that stuff so you after a while you kind of learn how to talk the talk so go ahead and pull

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:54.359
that up and I'm I'm I can't tell you how fortunate I am that I'm able to have access to these things blow that up

00:45:54.359 --> 00:46:02.099
should we that I that I'm able to have access to these texts we should all be thankful for this yeah yeah so it seems

00:46:02.099 --> 00:46:10.079
that the toxicon and remember the toxicon is a drug that's described by scrivonius largus as being so bad being

00:46:10.079 --> 00:46:17.220
so bad that the people who get it speak in tongues yeah they Babble they Babble

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:24.380
these people speak in tongues and for some reason their tongues are on fire

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:32.339
tongues of fire they say the lips too this doctor says the lips too okay let me translate this thing to you so it

00:46:32.339 --> 00:46:38.160
seems blow it up please it seems that the toxicon is named

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.800
from the the act of Christ in the arrows

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:50.579
yeah performed by the bottle right performed by the the non-greek

00:46:50.579 --> 00:46:57.240
speakers they're talking about these people up around the Black Sea is what they're talking about right so um but

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:03.960
notice on that second line wait a minute this isn't the word for anointing in the

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:09.599
soil no it's not it's the word for Christ in something why because when

00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:14.760
you're using a drug as we already saw in euripides you're christing

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:22.859
when you're sitting in a gymnasium you're getting Anointed The christing has to be there in the

00:47:22.859 --> 00:47:30.599
case of the application of mind-altering drugs it is the drug that brings you the

00:47:30.599 --> 00:47:36.420
fury Fury you look it up that's all it will say announce the fury

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:41.520
yeah love it love it okay bring us up that passage again let's let's keep

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:49.020
reading what this doc says so yeah what is this thing well he says um it's very bad when people drink it

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:56.880
and it causes their lips and their tongue to be inflamed it says that they

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:02.040
get a form of mania a form of mania

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:09.720
and it causes them to see many varied types of vision

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:15.540
yeah cosmc and they're tough to treat most of these people don't make it but

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:21.240
when they do right it's um he says first of all it's necessary

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:28.380
as they're coming through it and then he reads off this giant look this is okay I gotta read this it's necessary to treat

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:36.440
these people by binding them in Chains and compelling them to drink sweet wine

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:43.800
with rose oil in order to throw up or vomit right so that she's trying to get

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:51.480
him to vomit the stuff that they've eaten then he says then you take the seeds of this plant along with some wine

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:59.280
and you drink it and then you do this every day you're TR you're applying the roots of so and so the blood of so and

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:05.520
so and by the way the blood of so and so there's specific types of ingredients right the semen of Helios is an

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:11.220
ingredient right the sun semen right they're not talking about actual the Sun

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:16.680
an actual semen right so okay it's it's called speak what else are you going to

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:23.339
be using it could be using these substances including the sidonian apple and when you're gonna be administering

00:49:23.339 --> 00:49:32.460
this stuff right with all of these wonderful plants you're going to be doing it in the wine and after much time

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:38.220
if the person manages to come through the danger I'm translating if the person

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:43.680
manages to come through the danger they're gonna be bedridden for a while

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:48.839
and then when they try to get up and move around and assume a normal life

00:49:48.839 --> 00:49:54.619
what's going to happen to them they're going to be constantly frightened

00:49:54.619 --> 00:50:00.839
constantly take it down under stress right constantly frightened it has such

00:50:00.839 --> 00:50:08.520
a profound mental effect on you this arrow poison has such a profound effect on you that

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:15.619
it changes the way you react to people around you after you've been born again

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:22.800
have you seen what's there I'm going to give the call right you know I want preachers to to

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:29.819
write in I want these bloodsuckers I want them I can give the call the word of the

00:50:29.819 --> 00:50:37.560
devil now do you hear it do you hear that call you want to see the Unseen there is a world

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:46.980
around you there's a world around you functioning alongside and contrary to your own

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:53.400
Dimension there is another dimension that exists and that Dimension impresses

00:50:53.400 --> 00:51:00.420
itself upon yours as the guys at MIT are now fond of saying you are the

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:08.760
reflection through that event horizon of the actuality that is on the other side

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:16.559
you are the reflection of the actuality through the Event Horizon all the space

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:22.260
around you is filled with that world

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:27.839
you interact with it every day you smell it you taste it

00:51:27.839 --> 00:51:35.579
you live it you experiencing it those acts of passion those acts of

00:51:35.579 --> 00:51:40.680
passion are because of those interactions between the scene

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:47.520
and the Unseen right those of you who have eyes to see

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:54.599
like the dragon the dragon through it's from the Greek word for seeing

00:51:54.599 --> 00:52:01.020
but we know the dragon is blind so why did they name the

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:08.400
The Seer as the blind one um it's because that invisible dimension

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:15.240
around you cannot be perceived except by entering

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:24.059
into blindness you have to become like children you have to be able to come from a state

00:52:24.059 --> 00:52:29.160
of being unaware to a state of awareness

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:37.020
yes interesting that's quite a cult thing you've got going well it's Bronze

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:44.099
Age right old old stuff uh health health and drugs

00:52:44.099 --> 00:52:52.020
yes and now intercourse and how do we keep our oracles from becoming pregnant

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:58.680
we give them the burning purple it is that burning purple that Mary herself

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:06.900
had access to that she had in her culpos right it's that burning purple that the

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:11.940
Midwest said whoa burn in my hand all right something's

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:21.059
wrong yes it's that cult power that allows the Virgin to bring into the

00:53:21.059 --> 00:53:26.880
world the Son of God and all of a sudden you know we're right

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:34.140
back at home we're right back at home with the Giants we're right in that culture of drugs

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:40.920
none of this is available to you through the modern fairy tale of Christianity

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:46.859
church history it's not there

00:53:46.859 --> 00:53:52.319
you're not going to find it I'm gonna bring that to you and you can find that

00:53:52.319 --> 00:53:58.619
stuff yourself with the text because this is the age of you got no excuse I used to have to go

00:53:58.619 --> 00:54:07.020
to library right nobody does that anymore it's all going to be online now fantastic fantastic this is a huge

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:14.160
Universe okay we've got uh Gnostic informant who's going to come and he's gonna he's gonna say some strange things

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:20.819
and I'm gonna shut up for a minute and just let him uh hit at it how are you doing Gnostic informant I'm doing all

00:54:20.819 --> 00:54:27.000
right I have some uh little allergy bothering my eyes look a little red itchy but it's okay I'm all good

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:33.119
um so I that was fascinating by the way and I was um like I always do when I

00:54:33.119 --> 00:54:38.280
come on here I I listen and then I start thinking of stuff to pull up to bring to

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:45.480
the table and I'm thinking about the the time period in which the Greeks

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:51.660
started to move to Magna Gracia which is it which we know is southern Italy they called it the mag little or greater

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:57.420
Greece right Magna gratia and a lot of these Greeks came from what

00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:03.480
was Asia Minor modern-day turkey and a good book on this that I learned a

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:09.059
lot from with Peter Kingsley he uh in in the dark places of wisdom he right he

00:55:09.059 --> 00:55:15.059
gives you all the sources of really well sourced primary sources showing pictures of like archeology [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I love it I love

00:55:15.059 --> 00:55:21.780
it well here's what I want to connect with what you said he talks about how like Parmenides and Pythagoras they

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:27.839
would come to to Italy and they would set up the first thing we do is they would build a temple to the muses and

00:55:27.839 --> 00:55:35.099
then you so they'd build this Temple they they built it a certain way certain Dimensions certain ionic columns it

00:55:35.099 --> 00:55:41.819
would be like rectangular it would be up on a hill and you'd go inside there and you would find on one side of the

00:55:41.819 --> 00:55:48.240
whatever north side I'll say there is obviously Apollo golden Apollo with this

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:55.020
liar and this particular Apollo that was worshiped by parminities was Apollo

00:55:55.020 --> 00:56:00.059
ulios Apollo the Healer and this place was a multifunctional place where the

00:56:00.059 --> 00:56:06.119
people would go and they would uh deliver births there it was like a hospital there was also a temple so you

00:56:06.119 --> 00:56:12.240
had your you had your doctors you had your your Magi you had your priests you had all your you know your your you had

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:17.400
your poets you had your Scholars every this was the place right it was the temple the muses this is the place is

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:23.099
where everything's at but on the other side of the Temple

00:56:23.099 --> 00:56:28.380
you're you're thinking what is it Zeus what is it who uh nope the goddess

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:35.819
themus the most important thing ever is to have a statue of the Goddess themus

00:56:35.819 --> 00:56:41.160
the goddess of Justice I have a a screen that I want to share thank you for that

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:46.260
Chewie's on point by the way Themis is the Titan goddess of Divine Law and

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:52.859
Order of traditional rules of conduct who first established by the gods prophetic goddess who presided over the

00:56:52.859 --> 00:56:58.020
most ancient oracles including Delphi and uh

00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:03.119
um famous is referred to Divine Law she is the early bride of Zeus often

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:09.720
represented seated beside his throne advising him she's that wisdom you know what I mean

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:16.440
she without without think about this without Justice what do you have people people I get comments on my Channel all

00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:21.540
the time your social justice Warrior [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah I am hell yeah thank you for

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:28.800
that compliment I they think they like got me on that one that's a yeah I I am a warrior for Themis of course I'm a

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:34.619
warrior for theme is why wouldn't I be that's the that's the Divine way that's the you're the one that's off you're the

00:57:34.619 --> 00:57:40.500
one that's uh uh on the on the off course not me so but I might but I want to get back to

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:46.500
the medical side because that's that's all cool and important oh by the way you're probably wondering if Themis is

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:53.940
the earlier wife of Zeus Hera must be very jealous no Hera actually called her

00:57:53.940 --> 00:58:01.140
lady themes and looked up to her as like a motherly figure there was no beef between them weird right Hera is always

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:08.099
mad at all Zeus's other girlfriends she wasn't mad at Themis she loved themus and called her lady themus and respected

00:58:08.099 --> 00:58:13.319
her anyways put that aside for now I have a um so that's not all though

00:58:13.319 --> 00:58:19.140
because he would go down a pathway because you know the Greeks weren't stupid they knew that you couldn't just

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:24.540
put all the sick people in one room certain people had to be separated they had to be quarantined they knew this

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:29.700
stuff I think the word quarantine is even Greek not mistaken but I could be wrong it could be Latin or something but

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:37.380
anyways um they would go they would take him down his path and they would go like I don't know half a mile a mile away and

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:44.040
they would bring him down to the shores where there's a caves and in these caves they set up these well first of all they

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:49.500
had a grow for Dionysus down there they always have the Grove of Dionysus outside the temple not in the temple for

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:54.839
some reason Dionysus always was outside the temple they have The Grotto of Grotto of Dionysus you kept going and

00:58:54.839 --> 00:59:01.859
it's called the plutonium the caves and in these caves they would take really really sick people that are

00:59:01.859 --> 00:59:09.240
about to die or put them on or if they're on some sort of drug incubated and they put them asleep into a coma

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:15.599
they would bring them to these caves and then they would uh they would come back from these caves and Report their dreams

00:59:15.599 --> 00:59:20.940
and oftentimes these dreams were considered to be prophetic and the priests would be waiting the priest

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:27.900
would be waiting for people to wake up and say tell me what you saw I'm writing it all down right now this is serious this is this this is the Oracle this is

00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:36.359
the Sybil you you have to by law tell me what you saw and they took the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] seriously this is no joke well anyways I

00:59:36.359 --> 00:59:44.579
have a primary source about where these originated from Because by the way I mentioned these Greeks came from from the East to Magna Gracia this is a

00:59:44.579 --> 00:59:50.940
this is a uh this is a a thing that goes back to the times of Medea's Kingdom

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:56.160
remember talking about the ancient Medea Kingdom the the area known as Nisa you

00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:02.700
know in Asia Minor where Dionysus the god of Nisa Dionysus means dionisa god

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:10.079
of Nisa that's where he's born there so I got a source from strabo I'm gonna pull this up on my screen right now this

01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:15.780
is the last thing I want to say and then I'm done this is gonna you're gonna love this you're gonna love this so this is

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:20.940
from strabo from geography and what you're about to what you're about to hear right now well I'm going to read it

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:26.220
and read this whole thing it's real short is the the the the origin of these

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:31.260
incubation caves they're called plutoniums here we go

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:38.640
on the road between the trailions and Nisa is a village of the nessians not far

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:44.400
from the city uh akaraka where there is a plutonium remember I mentioned what

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:50.700
those are those are these These are these caves with the costly sacred priests sacred priesthood and a shrine

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:56.880
of Pluto and Quarry and also the coronium a cave that lies

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:02.880
above the sacred Precinct by by Nature wonderful for they say that those who

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:09.180
are deceased diseased and give heed to the cures prescribed I was just mentioning this they're on their drugs

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:14.460
they go to the caves they go to they go in their incubation they go and they go into a coma they're they're prescribed

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:20.280
by the gods to resort to their and live in the village near the cave among the

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:26.119
experienced priest who on their behalf sleep in the cave and through dreams

01:01:26.119 --> 01:01:33.599
prescribe the cures this is mind-blowing this is ancient medicine practice man this is amazing these are also The Men

01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:39.599
Who invoke the healing power of the Gods and they often bring the sick into the

01:01:39.599 --> 01:01:47.400
cave and leave them there to remain in quiet like animals in their lurking Holes without food for many days and

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:55.020
sometimes the sick give heed also to their own dreams but they but still still they use those other men as

01:01:55.020 --> 01:02:00.420
priests to initiate them into the Mysteries what they're getting initiated

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:05.579
the Mysteries here too and to counsel them to all others the

01:02:05.579 --> 01:02:11.700
places forbidden and deadly a festival is celebrated every year at akaraka and

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:17.880
at that time in particular those who celebrate the festival can see and hear concerning all these things and the

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:24.720
festival too about noon the boys and young men at the gymnasium nude and

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:31.559
Christ did that means in the Greek Christ stood with oil take up a bowl with a haste carry him

01:02:31.559 --> 01:02:38.640
into the cave and when let loose the bull goes forward on a short distance Falls and breathes out his life

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:44.819
there you go that's that's the city of Nisa where Dionysus was born and that is

01:02:44.819 --> 01:02:50.940
where these these pre-socratics came from to Italy to set up these temples of

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:57.680
the music they did it they copied it exactly how they saw it over there so this is where the source of that from

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:04.500

gonna tell us this is gonna be a good one yeah are you going to tell us some crazy stuff because there's

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:58.559
in this she's part of the story of of ancient Italy yeah can you imagine he

01:03:58.559 --> 01:04:05.040
was in Italy before any before any of these you know Roman Senators even thought about like medeas that's she's

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:10.799
there first yeah I I you know you wonder why Julius Caesar went to the Temple of

01:04:10.799 --> 01:04:19.200
Venus genetrics Venus the mother the producer of our people and he hangs up a

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:24.480
portrait of Medea by some famous Greek god I don't remember who it was but yeah

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:29.760
famous portrait of Medea love it they've got her name is and people don't realize

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.799
Neil think about this um you and I have talked about this but

01:04:34.799 --> 01:04:43.079
she is famous all the way from Babylon to Northern Italy how in the late Bronze

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:49.500
Age with their technology with their technology how is it that one person can

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:55.079
have such a broad power base and they end up in Athens and they end up in the

01:04:55.079 --> 01:05:00.780
Kingdom of Corinth and oh my God the entire entire people's will give you an

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:08.640
example the Aryans they were called the Aryans they changed their name to the medes to be named after her so when I

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:13.920
think of this when you think of like worldly famous people you know Alexander

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:19.079
the Great Julius Caesar uh Genghis Khan you know who whatever there's a lot of

01:05:19.079 --> 01:05:26.339
them she was the first she was the first world famous Queen before any before Caesar before

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:32.640
Alexander the Great it was Medea everyone knew and whether from coast to coast everyone knew who Medea was yeah

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:38.520
she's the exactly she is the inspiration for the earliest Greek literature we

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:46.380
know our sources tell us before the homeric epics there were epics about Medea it's an it's amazing but people

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:53.660
think the most powerful human ever is a man they're gonna pick some dictator from the 20th century or something no no

01:05:53.660 --> 01:06:00.299
Medea created an Empire of the mind that guided all of history that's you realize

01:06:00.299 --> 01:06:05.579
it's her mystery you Christians who were who are who are celebrating a mystery

01:06:05.579 --> 01:06:11.940
it's hers originally yeah right oh God I love it and um last thing I was going to

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:17.220
say um just to highlight how how famous she was

01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:24.240
in Athens in the 4th Century 5th Century BCE there's people writing plays about her

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:29.760
still 600 years later and this is geographic

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:35.339
wise this is a whole this is a three C's away the Mediterranean the Black Sea

01:06:35.339 --> 01:06:42.359
this is two three C's away so why are people all the way on this side of the of the in this in this area

01:06:42.359 --> 01:06:48.240
writing plays about a queen who lived all the way over here 600 years ago that

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:54.000
tells you something that's never been done anywhere else you can't you can't you can't like match that up with another example of someone else you
