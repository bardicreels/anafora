00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:25.680
um I wanted to throw Medea in here just so you could see right who is she she is

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:32.360
Madea and I'm gonna differ with translators here um they use will say Medea of caucus

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:38.339
right but I have seen her address directly as caucus

00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:45.500
so Medea or caucus remember she's the one of the many names the Palm basilea

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:51.540
Medea is the palmbasi Leia when you talk about Hera and when you talk about

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:58.440
Aphrodite and when you talk about the virgin when you talk about Hera and Aphrodite

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.500
inversion the three that we offer the golden apple to

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:13.700
all right she is each of them she is each of them lady Babylon Palm

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:19.500
basilea mustarion she is the source

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:26.540
and in this video I've narrated for you her activities directly from the sources

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:32.940
as the Christ as the Christ remember the Christ is a

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:39.420
woman not just the first person Christ did think about this not just the first

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.880
person Christ did but the person who figured out the

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:51.660
Christ sting yeah this is a single person a single

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:57.360
person through time so you hit us with that Source again I want us to keep going on that second one yeah who is she

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.980
yeah she's the daughter of eet's and what is that third that next word

00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:14.420
she is the most that's a superlative Greek student she is the most

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:21.300
Pharmaceutical she is the most knowledgeable in drugs

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:28.680

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:36.000
ethnic group said we are changing our identity

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.279

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:52.980

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:58.140
production of the moisture the moisture remember this is Aphrodite

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:04.560

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:20.160
Babylon all the way to Northern Italy all through North Africa Medea Medea

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.320
this most pharmaceutic now I want to show you and in just a second I want to

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:31.440
show you a little bit remember we were talking about the translation of

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:41.040
Septuagint I'm reading from a Septuagint so we told you about the translation many many centuries later into into

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:47.820
Hebrew that only has that much capacity you know eight thousand you know you cut

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:54.120
off a lot of that it's just extra space you know you cut off half of that because they're hot pox lagomina and you

00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:00.839
you end up getting just a few unique words as opposed to the Greek the Greek

00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:08.639
which has thousands of years of active vibrant development

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:14.399
Generation by generation through literature developing genres pushing

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:22.079
pushing pushing that religion onto the stage yes the dance is alone

00:13:22.079 --> 00:13:27.920

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:10.980
not swallowing the flood it was a local flood it was this flood

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:17.640

when you are staring the morning star in the eyes

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:55.200

00:28:02.279 --> 00:28:10.740

00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:55.740
in the water together and he looks up into Uranus and he sees the dove

00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:01.020
he sees that spirit that blows

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:08.940
he sees that spirit that flies across the garden Jesus is powered

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:16.799
by this mystery and when he is arrested in a public park at 4am with a naked

00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:24.600
child Mark 14 51 and 52. we know he has a reason to be screaming

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:33.360
I'm not a child trafficker this is a traceable rational cult

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:40.980
we can follow it through the evidence so that he doesn't get away with it
