00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.880
hello beautiful people and welcome to the cult explorers I'm your Hostess Snappy and I'm joined as always by my

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.480
co-host Dion and today we have a special guest in the house Ammon from Lady

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.800
Babylon and we're soon to be joined by our good friend Neil he's just running a few minutes behind but today is a really

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.119
fun episode this is our 33rd episode that we've done together Dion and I and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.440
we wanted to do something special we know that this particular number is a very occulted number it's connected to

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.440
eclipses and it's also connected to Jesus and a lot of this mythology that Ammon talks about that Neil talks about

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.879
and that we talk about here and recently we're doing our Deep dive into the

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.440
eclipse and that really kind of sparked your creativity a Dion and you really

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.000
wanted to dig down this thing so to start with you've kind of given us a presentation so I'm going to turn it

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.240
over to you and uh yeah you can begin well first we got to give a trigger warning in case we talk about piracy o

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.439
Ma's get ready because the season might get rough on this one um trigger warning

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.759
like I said so this is gonna get very violent and very sexual you know this is

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.640
not to be laughed at that warning and and since you guys are expecting some uh

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.680
numerology or gatria number 33 stuff um not too much into that but I do know in

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.000
this mythology that 33 ad at the 33rd

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.159
parallel at the age of 33 years old Emmanuel the Christ was crucified at a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.680
solar eclipse there's some 33s for you in a set of threes and uh I want to talk

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.240
about the night before you know what happened the day before Oh The Last

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.399
Supper you know and and you know before that so they have a last

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.640
supper now you talked about the Last Supper other people in different videos

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.080
now this is called a triclinium and that's a Roman term

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.920
for it's like a u shaped with beds and they recline when they eat you can see the people are laying down and that was

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.560
the normal way to do it and so your last supper would look something like that with people reclining with some sheep

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.599
kins Little Pirates and up in the leftand corner you could see

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.080
is from a tomb and those were the called theop agape love

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.239
tables and they would put mattresses on that and these are in the

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.000
catacombs we talked about this with Ammon before you were telling us that you have text about the Christians hot

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.360
boxing these catacombs and having orgies with these feasts yeah down there in these little

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.680
things goer what what were you gonna say almond yeah no I was gonna say um yeah

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.680
with the getting in trouble with the Roman authorities that's what I like to find you know and you got to remember

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.720
that one of the big clashes that they've got right off the bat is the incest

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.159
right the incest is intolerable so in these agapy feasts they start to break them up and the Roman authorities do and

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:28.439
the charges are they're taking kids off the street and they're putting them um through sexual practices initiations the

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:35.519
Christians uh are doing this right it's not as if it's some Christians today like oh it's you

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:43.799
know a rogue priest but this is the practice right the the initiation involves sexual exposure so that's where

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:51.040
you see them legally getting into problems with the Romans because they're doing it between um mothers and sons and

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:59.360
that's no good for the Romans and um if you just want to believe the Bible instead of you know um any other source

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.840
Paul is writing about this is a problem right so Jude is writing about it we've

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.640
got to get these sexual practices cleaned up right so yeah the Last Supper

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.919
wow so they're at the Last Supper and it's pretty naughty where they take a different

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.960
eucharists we know that they have Wafers they take which people could say they're

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.479
suppositories we know that there's uh alabast which are medicated dildos

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:37.360
we know there's talk of snake Venoms there could have been several things in these cups you have to take a

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.400
cup at this Feast you know also all the accusations

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.759
of the drinking of corpse lure so this is a thing that you see in the Roman texts where they're actually barring you

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:56.919
can still see some of these these tombs that are barred to this day to prevent people from drinking the corpse liquor

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.120
and getting the drugs from these bodies after they had Kade so hey NE how's it

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.600
going good you good welcome to the stream just to catch you up Dion is giving us kind of his

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.039
brief presentation on his idea of Jesus as this pirate figure and then we're

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.919
going to kind of Riff on it from there and just to start we're opening up with the last supper and we're discussing the

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.759
agape love feasts which I'm which you know all about and you look at the Last Supper

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:33.160
you got to have a bed for the last supper that's part of the condition you know that's a big part of it the

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.520
trinium where you would lay down and feast so let's hit the next

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.280
pick that's the garden game I've been there oh yeah and and just to show you

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.680
it's it's an Olive Grove exactly what it is an Olive Grove because that's sacred and that's part of the ritual it's part

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.479
of the anointing with olives there's a ritual uh bath there um you have a

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:05.080
figure in the corner um which is supposed to be John with a cup of snakes

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.599
and you'll find that in a lot of Art and so these this is the uh moments

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:19.319
leading up to the crucifixion the day before you see that building in the background that's that those St those bricks yeah yeah that's a church that's

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:25.319
uh that's an orthodox church it's been there for a while I'm not sure when they built it but it's been it's pretty old

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:33.160
um but when you go inside you can see the they have big paintings of the scenes of the night he got arrested and

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.000
in one of the paintings there is a little boy with a little piece of clothing on running away oh glad you

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.360
said that because you told that part of the story for me so I didn't have to I actually had that in my in my camera

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:51.680
when I went to Israel it's in my collection of images that's amazing yep and so it's because of that

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:59.160
he gets arrested and then we have a crucifiction that takes place like I said 33 ad at the 33rd parallel somebody

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.520
was 33 years old in the saturnian right involving snakes snake venom and little

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:13.360
kids and there was like I said an eclipse and something went wrong you know and so people talk about

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.560
this in terms of piracy the Le days that the disciples were young boys and that

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.440
there was uh themes of them going around snatching boys and not for the church

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.960
but to sell them into slavery or to use in sexual rituals and so I was wondering

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.240
is there any context behind that in ancient times in ancient Rome you know

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:43.599
um or Greece like I wanted to ask you specifically Ammon is odys is a

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:50.560
pirate he's not technically l no um he if anything he's getting trafficked by

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.960
some Pirates like Cersei and Calypso did anybody notice that he's held prisoner

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.759
for most of the 10 years that he's you know doing his Journey yeah I think the

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:06.919
one of the things I wanted to say about that to answer um to say how do we get

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:14.360
into the meet um real I think the entry level is um the age of the Apostles the

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:22.240
entry level those are his ma Thai those are his students his pupils their age

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:28.879
would have been anywhere from 10 to 12 to late teens right these are kids and

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:36.240
these are kids that he is separating from their houses and their families they themselves admit to it Peter says

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:43.399
you know we left everything behind right Peter's not married don't let anybody tell you Peter is married the only the

00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:48.839
evidence they use for that is the fact that he's got an in-law that makes him

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:54.720
seem more like he's a child he's young and he's living with his family but the right but the word that's used the the

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.920
word that's used for in-law is sister-in-law as well as mother-in-law so there's no proof that Peter ever

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.880
because she's never mentioned anywhere that she's got a wife Peter is one of the teenagers just like you know with

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:13.079
the youngest being John probably who's like 10 to 12 right who when he sits on

00:09:13.079 --> 00:09:19.640
Jesus's lap comes up to the middle of his chest you know so the picture of

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:29.519
Jesus with adult male um Apostles is absolutely ludicrous and it does not fit

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:35.120
with the the picture that comes out of his own mouth when Jes when Jesus is

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.399
about to be arrested right the authorities are coming up and they've brought the big

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:46.440
Force he he they go to take him and he screams I'm not a lace right he's trying

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:52.959
he's denying from the very arrest he's denying that he's one of these one of

00:09:52.959 --> 00:10:00.200
these things and what is that lay that lay very appropriately for the B Bible

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:08.399
is working with children in prostitution via drug using initiatory

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:14.360
Cults this is not just a business it's not just a criminal Enterprise you know

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:20.440
what I there are criminal Enterprises that are that's okay there are criminal Enterprises that

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:27.600
are centered around the operation of a mystery and that mystery initiation

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.959
involves the little kid getting drugged and you becoming a follower through

00:10:33.959 --> 00:10:40.839
their initiation so it's uh you know yeah take it for what it is if you guys watched my

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:46.519
last video about dianis I showed the I I translated the homeric him to bakus and

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:52.760
I use that as my intro well in that text they use the term leace for for pirates

00:10:52.760 --> 00:11:00.120
and sure enough this is this was mindblowing when I saw this dianis is depicted as a young boy ad Ence why are

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:07.200
they trying to abduct him if he's just a young boy in adolesence but get this even at the end the end of the when the

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:13.079
story's over dianis spares one person and it's one of their slaves who was a

00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:18.160
young boy so these lay are keeping kids and this must have been a known thing in

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.920
the Greek world that they were doing this oh yeah 100% I was reading some of

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:30.320
Caesar's writing on Pirates and one thing that stood out to me is that when he's describing these Pirates a lot of

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:36.360
them are the children that are being trafficked right it's like a Child Soldier type scenario where they're

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:42.320
taking these kids indoctrinating them and then sending them out to go get other kids you got to think about how

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:48.120
much value how much value a young boy would have in the ancient world you can groom them into whatever you want make

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:55.800
them make them into a soldier make them into whatever it's like that's a lot of value for a pirate to to go come across

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:02.760
we got some numbers for you one out of three in the Roman Empire was a slave one out of five in the Roman provinces

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:09.200
was a slave and you needed these slaves so go to the next pick Snappy and I want to break down a little bit of the Roman

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.519
slavery in the Roman Empire oh well there you go there's Jesus on an

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:21.040
anchor um and part of it I want to get into you talked about Caesar in 75 BC

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:27.040
Caesar was kidnapped by C Sicilian it's a weird word to say Turkish pirates from

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:33.839
Tarsus where Paul was born and they kidnapped him and part of the thing was uh he was held hostage for for

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:41.320
ransom and he even uh talk he got mad at them and said you're charging too little for me you got to charge more than that

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:48.199
you know it's famous in the story so his people go get the money come back and he crucifies him and he had warned him I'm

00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:53.560
gonna crucify you and he played their pirate games with them you know and the

00:12:53.560 --> 00:13:00.000
piracy in that time was big you had the miotic wars with mithi if you know about

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.519
the person who would take the snake venom poison King yeah yeah poison King the yupiter well he worked with those

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:13.000
pirates and he sacked at delos let's hit the next pick I want to break this down real quick because this is your guys'

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.519
wheelhouse so we got Apollo and Artemis born on delos the Island's special there you

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:25.480
know at a certain point they purged all the dead bodies off the island purified it no one's allowed to give birth there

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.760
or have a death there you would have to go to to roads or to another Island um

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.880
and this became the biggest slave port in the world with up to 10,000 slaves a

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.480
day coming through this port tax-free Asylum as well with a Jewish edict

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.639
because they have a special synagogue there where it's not Yahweh but L Elon

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:51.720
is the inscription and as well they had a temples to ball Anubis the Heracles

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:57.079
cave l l Elon is a translation of theop hyos yeah yeah that's what that's what

00:13:57.079 --> 00:14:04.120
on the wall that right there and and their synagogue there and so this is one of the places they were coming to so

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.880
what I did was I looked at all the pirate slave ports in the Mediterranean and some of the main ones were

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:15.480
Alexandria Ty torsus Philippi roads and

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:23.040
you type that in the AI and the word that comes out is Paul those are all the places that Paul goes to Paul the pirate

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:29.440
Saul paus and so let's hit the next pick um one of the versions they had there

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:36.880
was Apollo Mithra Helios an agami and later on the Pirates in the

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:43.199
Roman army adopted Mithra and the Pirates were into Mithra Big Time here's some symbols right there of Helios you

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:49.079
might see the swastika there and Apollo the sun you know and that Island was so

00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:54.240
special delos the slave Island but it eventually got sacked and Tak out by

00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:01.160
mythes took it out to get even with Rome because he knew that was the heart of their empire was the slave

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:09.120
trade and a lot of the slaves are coming from Judea all over you know hit the next

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:15.920
pick boom and one last myth on delos is the birth of Leto how Leto gives birth

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:22.000
to Apollo and emis under a palm tree which is the same thing with the Virgin Mary in the palm tree and in the Quran

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.160
with the palm tree as well as Buddha being born underneath the Salt

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:33.399
Tree and the him them having to touch the tree and so this Mythic pirate

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:39.759
saturnian stuff and you know mythra's father is Saturn and so just saying there's some

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:47.240
pirate uh mythology and Mithra stuff going on this connection with this ancient stuff so hit the next

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:53.240
pick boom so Paul Paul would go around to all these ports these little slave

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:58.920
ports there's a this is acts 20110 when the kids fell out the window what does

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:04.519
Paul have to do Paul has to go down and get on top of him the little boy you can go to the next pick here's a

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:11.399
representation of it that you'll see in art in the turn of century art yep that's him healing the young boy go to

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:17.639
the next one I'm going quick for you guys Elicia the prophet Elisha he has to

00:16:17.639 --> 00:16:24.839
get down to the little boy put his mouth on the child's mouth lays on the little boy to heal him you know so I'm showing

00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:31.240
there's a precedence of pirates slavery messing around with little boys and also

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:36.720
Paul born at torsus were this the capital of the cicilian Pirates was also

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:43.160
a tax report and had Asylum because of the money it generated through the slaves and that's where Paul were

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:51.240
talking about so let's hit the next pick also real quick I think that's a drug reference there he sneezes seven times

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.440
you sneeze when someone puts something in your nose oh so I think there's a lot of that going on in the Bible where

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.920
they're they'll make it look like like it's a miracle but they'll leave a little hint and say well this is actually a drug reference to some sort

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:10.438
of antidote insufflation they call it Neil insufflation um it's one Administration

00:17:10.439 --> 00:17:16.558
route for drugs and Antiquity you can fumigate somebody in a in an enclosed

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:22.839
room right with just burning substances you can put something into their rect

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:30.280
them and get it right into their system that way they they do that um but another way they have is blowing

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:38.320
directly up the nostril so they have these little in insufflation tubes and you just blow it in whatever

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:44.799
plant it is mixed with whatever you want and it ends up um it's a drug route

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:50.400
Administration I want to know Furthermore with Paul to support your um

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:57.480
your findings uh Dion is why is it that he's immune to Viper Venom because the locals

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:03.000
when he shows up um and he's bit by a snake and the snake's hanging off of him

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.400
and it's a little one just like the little ones that Jesus goes to in the

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.880
Aron right remember when the Angels appear to Jesus when he's in the the the

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:19.480
void and he's there with the th on he's there with the little snakes the ones

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:27.559
that they have that Paul gets bitten by and he's immune it's a miracle Praise Jesus he's he's not he's not dead all

00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:33.320
the locals were like oh that guy must have been a murderer because um he's gonna die now he's not going to get 10

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:40.320
steps he's gonna die they knew which one it was the bit of and he just brushes it off and it's no problem there's a reason

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:45.360
that Jesus told those Apostles remember they're kids there's a reason he told

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:52.760
them you can raise up serpents and if you drink the deadly drugs they won't

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.919
hurt you that's that's direct out of Mark that's that it's Central to

00:18:57.919 --> 00:19:05.000
Christian if you are a Christian today let me challenge you if you are a Christian today and you are not involved

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:12.280
in using Venoms and in the rape of children you are not a true Christian

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:17.559
oh so only Pentecostal snake handlers are true

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:23.360
Christians you know you know who the true Christians were so valentinus and you can trace this back you can check

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:29.000
out the evidence there's a lot of different sources that say valentinus his student was Mages but

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.360
anyways Valentine is was a student of thus thus that's the girl that traveled

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:42.120
around the world with Paul he's he's he's literally two students away from Paul okay so what was valentineus why

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:48.799
was he so popular why was he almost he was second amount of votes for the high Bishop of the whole Roman Empire second

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:55.640
he lost to he lost to St eus or whatever his name is the the third Pope on the list or whatever anyways this guy was

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:02.320
doing Eucharist putting drugs in Eucharist and doing with drinking purple [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's in the sources so like you're

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:08.799
two away from Paul and you're still doing that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's what real Christians were doing yeah pretty

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:16.039
Gnostic well you said right the purple's important because the purple was also part of the

00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:21.679
trade it wasn't just boys it was purple as well um that was a signifier you

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:27.840
could see I mean even the Phoenicians were famous for kidnapping you know if you you left your your kids down by the

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:34.679
sea and The Phoenician boat was around you might just see it sailing away you know that was one thing I noticed too

00:20:34.679 --> 00:20:39.840
Ammon I wanted to ask you about is I keep seeing these themes of these pirate Wars between the Romans and the

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:45.600
carthaginians they're both doing the piracy but they're accusing the other of doing it worse you know and they're both

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.600
worshiping Saturn they're both doing these blood sacrifices what's going on there yeah notice the sea power how

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:59.720
important it is in Mediterranean history I mean all of the oldest cultures I'm not talking about anything in the Levant

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:05.120
that stuff's brand new I'm talking about the old calal lithic stuff notice

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:12.880
they're all seafaring cultures the technology that really bursts through is

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:20.360
the seafaring um the capacity to trade goods yeah and the capacity to colonize and

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:26.919
this is a Bronze Age thing they're breaking through the the fact that we have the oldest um reference to an epic

00:21:26.919 --> 00:21:35.400
is the Argon it's supposed to be the Voyage of the first ship yeah right now whether it was

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:42.880
or not let them dig them dig it up at the bottom of the Black Sea right they'll find stuff um but uh this first

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:49.159
ship what does this first ship do just ask yourself this one question and we're

00:21:49.159 --> 00:21:56.240
out of myth now we're in history what is this first sailing vessel do it sails to

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:03.440
culus and abducts a teenage girl there you go there another example

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:10.159
of L yeah yeah J definitely be a pirate if odys isn't but Jason surely is that's

00:22:10.159 --> 00:22:16.279
that's what that's what sparks off the Trojan War was Pirates stealing young women two of them getting trade back

00:22:16.279 --> 00:22:22.679
into they they first it was media and then they went and in retaliation they went and captured Helen then the war

00:22:22.679 --> 00:22:28.279
started they both that's how the war starts two two bad moves happen and then all of sudden it's a war and they also

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:34.440
got Europa don't forget Europa that's what got Cadmus involved and all that kind of stuff right all right th yeah

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.760
again again the fans remember they're developing the use

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:46.559
of the purple and the purple as Dion said is hand in hand with the right with

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:53.679
the child transforming or as you and I would say child rape ritual yeah yeah

00:22:53.679 --> 00:23:00.400
yeah you know so you wonder where where did they get the boats from where could Jes Jesus get these boats in some of the

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:07.159
mythologies they'll say his father is a ship Builder a carpenter he works with wood he's building ships well Mary solom

00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:14.120
may had a fleet of boats it says in the Bible she had more than one it says she was a woman of means a lot of them more

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:19.799
woman means even when Paul goes to Philippi with Lydia you know that's the

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:24.840
purple trade that's that's pirate that's a pirate for wait is a is a tekon just a

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:31.679
wood Builder or is that something else no it's i' I've seen it I've seen it

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:36.720
Neil and I think it's not just a wood worker but it's also a wood worker in

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:43.039
ships oh okay yeah yeah yeah makes sense that's amazing so Mary solom may had

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:49.640
boats um hit the next picture and it's important like we we point out Mary salame is the mother of the sons of

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:57.960
thunder which is John the Beloved and his twin brother James yeah so uh there's there's stories

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:04.960
of Jesus doing the ministry on the boat pulling up on the boat and you see some naked boys right there in the picture

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.320
those that's the crew right there you know and tell me this tell me this why

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.640
after he's crucified the disciples go back out fishing and they're naked on a

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:22.039
boat and he has to put on his clothes to jump into the water yeah you know they just crucified your Messiah but you want

00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:27.240
to go get naked and go fishing by the way I just want to point this out if I don't know when this was made this

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.000
painted by by what school stuff I like the Jehovah right right but I'm say if they know anything about the ancient

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.320
world they would know that a sh a clean shaven face is represents a young boy so that that that could be intentional yeah

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.880
they're naked yeah you know he's clothed and because those colors represent that

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:52.840
no shaving back then you had to be like super rich to get a good razor yeah yeah when Alexander the prophet the false

00:24:52.840 --> 00:25:00.399
prophet and remember he's a real historical guy that we have statues of and representations on coins he was

00:25:00.399 --> 00:25:06.240
super super popular in the same area on the south side of the Black Sea he was

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:13.840
doing the Jesus thing and in doing the Jesus thing he he he came through it

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:21.159
himself as a boy and describes when he was just that kid on the edge of

00:25:21.159 --> 00:25:28.200
ripening when he couldn't you know he didn't he only had peach fuzz on his chin that's when he was being sold now

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:34.080
he to he took it upon himself right and he made the transactions himself but he

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:41.840
grows up to be a lace and and um we're told now this is within a hundred years

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:50.039
is of Jesus himself living and doing his thing we have another guy who's saying

00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:57.919
um this is what a lce day is and this is historically what they're like and what they do and if you notice that lay state

00:25:57.919 --> 00:26:04.360
Alexander is doing exactly everything that Jesus does exactly but he has so

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:10.440
much power that he's able to have other provinces send him their best looking

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.880
boys their best looking kids and he makes it a rule as a lay stays never to

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:21.919
kiss any kid that's over 18 and it's just coincidence that they chose 18

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:28.640
right because they didn't have legal age you consent so oh

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:35.600
can we hit the next pick oh there's that purple right there that that's important

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:43.039
because uh it's like a drug it's like putting two drugs together you know you're compounding with with a young boy

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:50.080
or young girl and these drugs put together you're having chemical reactions that are fused

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.480
in Magic rituals that's where the purple comes from those snails right yeah yeah

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:03.559
we see this being practiced in throughout the ancient Bronze Age right in Phoenicia as well as in um Mia in cre

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:10.720
so you know it's ancient stuff yeah the it's from what I'm from what i' from what I know are the ones who' discovered

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:16.320
it the Phoenicians are the ones that trade it it's always exactly like wine it's similar to how we see the process

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.440
of wine like you were talking about they credit for all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because they're they're the Traders like the alphabet

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:27.960
like who knows alphabet could have been if you look at the alph if you look at that Phoenician alphabet there's a lot of lot of the same symbols that you see

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:35.240
in Linear B so like what's going on there did it did they just invent this office or they use it based off Linear B

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:44.000
I don't know I'm just saying well the Phoenicians the Phoenicians don't forget pH the word phic phos in great just

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:51.720
means purple purple right yeah they're the purple people the purple traders that was even even in their tongue

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:57.279
Kanani means purple too so they like they kind of call unless like they call this is what this is how it works they

00:27:57.279 --> 00:28:02.519
don't call themselves that they are okay with being called that but they would they would refer to themselves as

00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:08.200
sidonians or tyrians whatever city they're from right are slave ports those are

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:13.240
pirate slave ports yeah you know hit the next

00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:22.720
pick oh if you could say that word for me my French is not so good the mat

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:29.480
M you know that was an agreement amongst pairs of European sers met metage yeah

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:35.720
yeah and you'd be mates that's where you get the word mate aoy mate and you would agree to share your incomes and inher

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:43.320
your your partner's property you would fight for each other and there were homosexual unions that was promoted

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:50.480
amongst the Pirates and amongst the ships this is this is the formalized version later on as a term in France as

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:57.799
a legal term because you could go to court and fight and say well my partner died and I get half of the the uh the

00:28:57.799 --> 00:29:05.240
Del bloom or whatever but this is also a Trope we see across um history especially and once

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:11.600
you get into the Catholic era where homosexuality is extraordinarily persecuted a lot of people run off to

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:19.159
become pirates in order to pursue their their that that you know their love you

00:29:19.159 --> 00:29:26.159
know because on the international Seas is a different form of law yeah and you have something that's Maritime sea law

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:31.440
and that was law that came to together for All Ships to trade and come together you had to have a uniform yeah because

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:37.080
you're not going you're not going to a courtroom to decide on issues you decide in the se you got to decide there so

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:43.880
it's a different it's a it's a free world yeah I know I almost feel I'm

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.960
almost I almost get jealous when I think about it like I wish this is a world we had right now I'm just kidding well no

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:54.440
but it's this interesting thing when you study the Pirates across history you see that they're the best of us and the

00:29:54.440 --> 00:30:00.480
worst of us right you know in the Caribbean they're starting these free Democratic societies that have

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.399
constitutions you know at the same time they're running around trafficking people but you know what they were doing

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:11.679
they're looking back at the last sea fairing uh civilization which was the Greeks what did how did the Greeks

00:30:11.679 --> 00:30:18.120
figure this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out they had all these islands everywhere how do they keep it together oh constitutional republics

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:23.399
democracy Senate oh okay that's what let's try that for it's the first hasn't

00:30:23.399 --> 00:30:28.799
hasn't been tried in 2,000 years let's do it and then they brought it back that's what they were

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:34.240
doing you know what if I can change direction a little bit what is the uh

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:39.440
what but I totally agree what um I would just call it Neil civilization right

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:46.640
that's how they looked at it the Greeks of the time and the Romans that was the civilization and the dark Forces of

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.679
Christianity tore that down tore down that Civilization we didn't get

00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:58.919
democracy back until good old you know Tom J and all those guys finally said hey let's bring this old thing back what

00:30:58.919 --> 00:31:05.679
do you do though with that thran pirate guys what do you what do you do with the thian pirate who puts the boy to sleep

00:31:05.679 --> 00:31:14.039
with his drugs and then um cuts off his testicles and turns him into his

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:21.720
dionisis what I mean it's it's a tradition um uh what is that all about

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:28.760
what is that is it is it just straight up pedophilia or is it um some kind of

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:35.039
maturation R what is the significance of this castration stuff I mean you know so

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:40.440
this is something that's personal to me as a transperson and I've gone deep looking into these kinds of castration

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:48.559
rights across history and I think what we're seeing is a later tradition based off of a much earlier Bronze Age

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:55.720
feminine right that would be done between mother and child and it would be a child at a young age who would have

00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:02.279
presented themselves as trans and then went through that initiation you know and this is where you get you're at a

00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:09.080
story you know but it's also important like people like Julian talk about it is that it it's it's a literal ritual that

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:16.279
happens for some but it's also a philosophical mental thing that happens for others within the rights of dionisis

00:32:16.279 --> 00:32:21.919
they talk about this in order to experience the all you have to become the feminine this is where you get that

00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:27.360
dominant figure of like tyresius who's who lives as a woman and also is a bir

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:34.799
at at a time you know so it's like it's all about rehealing that kind of wound returning back to that Fon character you

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:40.320
know before the separation you know he did that gender switching uh uh Snappy

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:45.519
he did it through the um serpent right right that's how they're that's how

00:32:45.519 --> 00:32:52.559
they're doing all the gender switching so there's this thing about gender switching and kind of it's they almost

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:58.080
look at it as education they use the same terms that you would use for

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:06.679
education so it's like a you know it's it's almost like that pirate or that lace that trafficker is involved in a

00:33:06.679 --> 00:33:12.320
system that ultimately takes a boy that's abandoned and gives that boy a

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:18.039
female perspective and an education and it's you say it's no wonder that Phillip

00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:24.320
the Apostle of Jesus Christ um was walking around with um young girls who

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:32.360
had transitioned who he had transformed in the acts of Philip it says into into

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:38.279
boys well this is what I think okay um I think that we have all of these drugs a

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:45.159
lot of this psychedelia a lot of this all of it is coming out of these feminine rights and it begins as a way

00:33:45.159 --> 00:33:51.600
to deal with um period issues hormonal issues and pregnancy which is killing

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:59.480
most women in the in at this time you know and so all of these rights are coming out of this Prim like out of this

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:06.639
kind of good reasoning but what happens is like what happens if you develop a drug that can transition someone into a

00:34:06.639 --> 00:34:12.638
female in a literal sense of course abusive horrific especially at this time

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:19.800
where there are no overarching laws of course abusive people are going to take advantage of this to traffic people you

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:26.520
know it's it's it's a natural outpouring it's like um it's disgusting and shocking but it doesn't mean the drugs

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:32.520
and the rights as they originally were practiced were were wrong or evil you know because I think they're coming out

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:37.919
of this reality that trans people exist and trans people are suffering and you

00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:43.000
know that these women who are looking at their trans children are not going to abandon them they're going to try to

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:50.000
help them you know live that life and we see this time and time again with a lot of these shamanistic cultures where

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.919
trans people non-binary people or B gendered people are usually the Priestly

00:34:55.919 --> 00:35:01.760
cast people you know and this is true of a lot of premodern civilizations across

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:09.880
the world right and that's why they have the gynomorph the Greeks worship the form that is um masculine transitioned

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:15.920
to feminine and they worship that form and then what um would be the polar

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:21.320
opposite I guess hormonally biologically is the woman who has the

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:28.160
full the um who has the full penis and the original statues of Aphrodite and

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.720
Prof this is hilarious because professors look at these and scratch their head oh let's not talk about those

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:40.839
right the oldest statues of Aphrodite they have a large erect penis and you know people look at them

00:35:40.839 --> 00:35:46.359
and they're um guess what they're talking about transitioning in Antiquity

00:35:46.359 --> 00:35:52.280
it but it's within a religious context so that somebody who is transitioning

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:59.800
they enter into it voluntarily um and they go through a process that starts with their

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:08.359
emasculation for boys and then a drug regimen that transforms them into this

00:36:08.359 --> 00:36:15.359
dionysiac um revered and worshiped uh individual right and then they have the

00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:21.040
class that's they have the gynomorph and then they have the class of the Divine

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:27.319
Incarnation what is the Divine Incarnation it's both it's hermaphroditic

00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:33.800
right yeah exactly hermaphrodites were worshiped and in Antiquity with both the

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:41.160
Greeks and the Romans yeah the birth the birth of a hermaphrodite would be interpreted as

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:47.440
some kind of hugely significant um sign of the ages something was going to

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:54.680
happen somebody you see this so much in a lot of the oric text like I just keep thinking about Lucifer and and or or

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:59.720
Apollo and emis right one is the masculine female one is the feminine

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.359
male and they're they're mirrors of each other right they there's that taboo love

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:12.240
of incest that we see also there's like you know and then they relate back to the Fones in a lot of these witchcraft

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:21.119
Traditions like in Aradia they talk about how Diana is ripped into two and she becomes both Artemis and um and

00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:27.839
Lucifer or Apollo you know so there's all of this weird kind of gender play and I think a lot of it has to do with

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:33.440
this mystery of experiencing of the all and this deep understanding and we also

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:39.240
see like it's important the Greeks don't talk about it as much in their texts but we do see the reverse side when they

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:44.440
look at the skians we see skythian women going through a transition they're

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:52.200
they're transforming themselves into these giant Warriors and they're even wearing beards like we had that one um

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:58.119
Warrior who was duing up it was a 17 or 18yearold girl who's over six feet tall

00:37:58.119 --> 00:38:04.640
and wearing a fake beard and buried like an like a king you know

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:09.720
so Egypt Egyptian uh Queens did the same

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:15.119
too they did what was going on in Egypt I think it's either Nefertiti or nefari

00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:20.800
one of those two was um presenting herself as a man when she came out to visit the public she had a beard she had

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:26.119
a fake beard and dressed in men's Garb and they treated her as a regular

00:38:26.119 --> 00:38:31.560
pharaoh like any other male Pharaoh so if you'd like to know a little more about that

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:37.000
um some of the Beards were goat beards that they would attach because of the

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:43.960
goat collecting the mastic the incense the sacred incense

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:49.960
and you got the flail that the Pharaohs hold the crook and the fail yeah and we

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:56.359
did an episode on how the the goats and the goats would collect in the fields through that to that plant makes sense

00:38:56.359 --> 00:39:03.440
and then they would cut off the that and they would attach it and it's like a sacred beard of incense and so it had

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:09.720
multiple connotations and that is it has the sacred incense it has the goat energy as

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:16.000
well yeah it's fasina you know and a lot of this I think is also going to these

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.079
premodern stuff too like we see all of this reflection with um you know like

00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:27.480
these ancient primitive peoples like the Greeks are always reacting to the people around around them and they're

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:32.520
describing all of these piratic cultures you know these people who if you land on

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.720
their Islands the people will rip you apart like there's the Mad women in the

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:44.960
north there's the ski skians on the crimeans there's the Giants the cyclopses like there's hundreds

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:51.960
seemingly of these groups of these weird tribal peoples that practice these cannibal piratic kind of things what's

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:57.200
going on there Neil was just talking about Neil tell him about post Sedonas

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:02.760
with the women on that island yeah so they with their babies this is a crazy

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:08.760
story because all the way somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean he doesn't he doesn't like specify I think it's somewhere near

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:14.280
France or Britain because the reason why I think there's a lot of islands over there a lot of small Islands we think of

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:21.079
like we see you see the map and you see England and you see Ireland but you don't see those little tiny islands and they're big enough to have a little town

00:40:21.079 --> 00:40:26.440
there right the there's a lot of those there's like thousands of those anyway

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.839
one of those islands who knows where it could be a it's like picking a needle out of the hay stack one of those

00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:38.319
islands had a tribe of Amazonian type women who only worship bakus nothing

00:40:38.319 --> 00:40:44.400
else only dianis and they would so they would it was all women so you're thinking how

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:52.480
does how the hell is that even possible how do you have a only women living there when there's no men to make more babies well he tells you how they do it

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:57.960
the The Virgins get sent to the mainland per probably Gul or something and they

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:05.079
would find a man to get her pregnant then they she go back and then when they had a child if it was a boy they would

00:41:05.079 --> 00:41:13.280
rip it apart in a in in a ritual diania Eva Eva yak yak rip it apart eat it and

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:20.319
then if it was a woman they raised it up as their own that's how you get an all female matriarchal

00:41:20.319 --> 00:41:26.839
society wow it's intense there's so much crazy like that's world is the ancient

00:41:26.839 --> 00:41:33.720
world is like a movie right well we we forget right like I also think about like the Cyclops and the Griffins who

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:39.160
are described In Perpetual Warfare over the this some kind of sacred treasure

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:44.520
you know like there's all of these weird tribal type groups that are this

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:52.520
mysterious you know it's really interesting to think about but going back to to to to Jesus and this this

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:59.040
piracy like just watching your video on dionisis you know where it's clearly um

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:04.520
these piratic rights are associated with The Cult of dionisis and orus Diana and

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:09.960
Lucifer um but you see like look like just listen to your video and everything

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:15.599
like how Jesus is dionis you know oh yeah and it's so blatant like you could

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:23.440
go through the whole Bible and half of the stories are taken from other texts like the baky you know like is is Peter

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:30.079
just pantheus or you know like there's a lot of weird parallels you know this so

00:42:30.079 --> 00:42:36.680
Me Myself and not just me there's a a Harvard scholar Dennis McDonald he's

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:42.480
been shouting out the rooftops his entire all the classicists are hearing him what he only it's like he's a

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:48.440
classicist now he just went from being a Bible scholar to a class he's been telling these Bible scholars if you say

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:54.520
I am the True Vine that is dionan you cannot say that everyone in the ancient

00:42:54.520 --> 00:43:01.559
if you're walking around the first century and sayi am the True Vine that's like saying I that's like saying I am

00:43:01.559 --> 00:43:09.000
the sky father that's Jupiter you don't say that's literally Dian Isis the True Vine means the word bakus means

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.119
Vine like you can't just say that so di Dennis McDonald's basically saying look

00:43:15.119 --> 00:43:21.119
he's trying to Dethrone dianis as the this this God's son dionis is known as

00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:27.559
the best God son there is next to Apollo maybe him them two are probably equal at it or I mean Heracles is kind of

00:43:27.559 --> 00:43:34.520
important too but dianis and Apollo are God's son everyone knows it they are the princes of Heaven they are the princes

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:41.200
and so Jesus trying to be God's son is trying to be dionan you know what it is is sorry H go

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:47.119
ahead Ammon no I'm sorry Snappy even more than that I'll just add um he's

00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:55.119
he's the Divine son who dies and resurrects um yeah no it checks all the

00:43:55.119 --> 00:44:01.760
boxes ding of the things that that I studied in University was the the formation of new religious movements

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.839
through the hybridization of cultural ideas okay you know you don't ever see

00:44:06.839 --> 00:44:13.520
new religious movements pop out of nothing you know rosta fari is a reaction to Christianity and the black

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:18.720
power movement yet it becomes something distinct and of its own you know so it's

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:24.240
like this is how new religious movements form they react to the spiritual

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:30.760
cultures in which they exist and if dianis is the most popular deity or at least one of the most popular deities

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:38.599
why wouldn't the Christians invert this and as Ammon always points out in his videos Homer is what understanding Homer

00:44:38.599 --> 00:44:44.960
is what it means to be educated at this time to have Homer memorized it's like what we see with the Quran in the

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:51.359
ancient in the modern world among Muslims you know people are reciting this daily and they're using it for all

00:44:51.359 --> 00:44:57.599
sorts of things like you'll see Carpenters who will will use Homer and

00:44:57.599 --> 00:45:04.640
parts of Homer to help them remember things about their work and this is a normal thing like the myths take on

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:13.319
because they're so memorized and they're so recited they take on this important cultural role of Mimis and memorizing

00:45:13.319 --> 00:45:21.760
Homer's like the ancient form of the internet if you had access to a homer scroll or or papy or some sort of like

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:27.760
um skin that had the text on it you had that that's like having the internet back then because Homer has so much

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:32.800
information about Geography about rights about different gods it's all packed in

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:39.160
there it's it's all the information in the ancient world is you could find it in Homer he tells you about the pans he tells you about the Minoans he it's all

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:45.280
in it's all in Homer like Homer the way he wrote Such a genius way it's this poetic way of talking about things that

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:52.240
are actually going on weaving it into a story into a coherent brilliant story it's amazing

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.920
it's also it's like it's important that we understand how these ancients though are utilizing these texts these texts

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:03.319
are so Central to their entire understanding of everything around them

00:46:03.319 --> 00:46:08.559
right like yeah we still do this to our Modern Day stories are essential to how

00:46:08.559 --> 00:46:14.400
we perceive the world well this was the story this was it you know and we can

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:19.480
see like like all of these different communities are looking at Homer and are

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:26.920
reinterpreting it through their own lens to use it in a variety of different ways it becomes work songs become you know it

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:32.520
becomes en coding of math coding of so much knowledge it's not just a religious

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:38.839
text it's how they transferred culture and and history you know there's even

00:46:38.839 --> 00:46:45.119
medicine and Magic that come from Homer and the the magic books that we have or

00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:52.319
papiery that we have um use Homer for the uh performance of the sores so their

00:46:52.319 --> 00:46:59.319
oracular science um will use actual verses from Homer that shows you how

00:46:59.319 --> 00:47:06.160
Central what you're saying is exactly right Snapp and it's like it's not just the Greeks we see this with that like

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:13.119
all cultures of this time period have these kind of centralized myths that they're utilizing in this different way

00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:20.319
right like there's their literal meaning there's the metaphoric meaning then there's the extended metaphoric meaning

00:47:20.319 --> 00:47:26.119
that has to do with these secret societies and different groups and all of these different groups are used this

00:47:26.119 --> 00:47:31.319
text because everyone memorizes it and we don't we're not writing things down

00:47:31.319 --> 00:47:37.240
as easily you know so yeah makes sense and you have to

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:44.040
protect those cult activities through those language codes that they have and

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:51.480
um that's a whole big branch of um kind of esoteric ancient esoteric knowledge is

00:47:51.480 --> 00:48:00.240
what are the codes that are invol what are the Seals that they're putting on stuff what do they mean when they say they're seal they're sealing a scroll right that just

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.760
immediately comes to mind is one of my favorite uh orphic Vox phrases that we

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:11.160
see in the Bible which is the ears to hear yeah you know like anyone who

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:16.720
understands Classics it's going to immediately recognize that as an orphic phrase why is that coming out of the

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:22.760
mouth of Jesus you know yeah or the those golden those Golden Leaf tablets

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:31.000
they found those orphic texts it says with with those ears to hear come enter those who don't get out right very it's

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.640
very it's not even similar it's the same thing it's they're saying the same exact thing Jesus is saying the same thing in

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:42.520
the beginning of Mark he's doing I'm saying these things so that some of you will hear and you know he's it's not for

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:48.960
everyone right Jesus is open op is openly using Code I've always wonder why

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:56.480
people don't give a anything about this why they don't care about this Jesus is a guy with children apost Muses who

00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:02.720
constantly talks in code about cult activity that involves

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:08.960
drug use and child prostitution and he's looking over his shoulder did you ever notice how Jesus is looking over his

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:15.240
shoulder every five minutes and going they're on to me they're on Me Do you ever notice in his ministry as soon as

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:22.760
he gets his ministry started he's going from one place to another running from groups who want to kill him or want to

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:27.880
worship him one of the two the last guy who was in his position got his head cut

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:33.559
off remember right John the Baptist you know and he also had these same kind of

00:49:33.559 --> 00:49:39.000
sexual accusations made against him you know it's it's it's not coming out of

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:47.079
nowhere and John the Baptist in infers in nature the diic John the

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:55.880
Baptist what's up no I was just I was just looking at a I was just looking at a passage on him today with a student

00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:01.760
we're reading Mark together just because it's super easy and he's he's talking

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:08.200
about um John and his special place and what is hilarious is he uses the term

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:13.240
people think it's um Jesus um was

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:22.000
baptized by John they had the whole meeting he's baptized when he comes out of the water he sees heaven uranos open

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:30.599
and the spirit descend like a dove and that process compels him into the Aron Into

00:50:30.599 --> 00:50:35.960
the Wilderness and what's funny is Mark himself the author whoever the author is

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:41.720
of this right if he's Mark or not I don't give I don't care yeah I don't care either I just but who whoever wrote

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:50.200
it distinguished that expression into the Wilderness from an actual desert

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:57.319
where Jesus traveled he distinguishes it w with a demonstrative to uh um he uses

00:50:57.319 --> 00:51:04.359
the word the noun topos he says this time he goes to a topos an actual place

00:51:04.359 --> 00:51:12.240
that is an Aron Jesus is in this psychological Aron talking to the devil

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:18.000
about what casting out demons and as soon as he's done with it and started

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:25.920
started his uh Ministry people are coming to him saying look look look look look he's he's eating with the hamaro

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:33.440
right he's he's eating with the The Pimps who were involved in harvesting tax right when people say oh Matthew was

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:38.920
a tax gatherer right he a tax collector right a telones right

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:46.079
what what do you think that was you think he worked for the state no he worked for businesses

00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:52.200
namely namely the prostitution business that's being run by the homoy right or

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:58.680
for the homoy and those people have to to be taxed right it's a whole when you

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:05.520
purchase a a an underage prostitute from Jesus's Den in Antiquity um you got to

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:11.880
pay a tax on it right right right just just the way it is when they say tax

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:18.880
collector that's what they're talking about they're talking about people who take a percentage of goods and

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:24.359
services yeah and people don't realize that it it's you know mainstream piracy

00:52:24.359 --> 00:52:29.599
people well there is one exception when you go to Tarsus the birthplace of Paul

00:52:29.599 --> 00:52:34.760
it's a taxfree report and you could sell young boys and and children there for

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:42.280
taxfree I mean so you get wait a minute so you get a break right you get a break there

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:48.359
right but with in in Judea in Judea at the time when Jesus

00:52:48.359 --> 00:52:54.799
walks by the table and he says Matthew's there he's like good get over here Levi

00:52:54.799 --> 00:53:01.640
they call him one get get over here you realize that guy is a tax collector in

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:07.520
this industry and when he recognizes the authority of Jesus and follows him and

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:15.040
it doesn't mean follow people think it's oh I've been saved that I'm gonna follow Jesus no it doesn't it means he's still

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:21.799
a tax collector but he's working with Jesus it's aalo in Greek he's working as

00:53:21.799 --> 00:53:30.040
a slave for Jesus who's big p daddy with his boys yeah

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:35.760
yeah it seems to make sense by the way John the Baptist everyone wants to uh

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:42.680
assume that he's being drawn from Elijah and that's fine because you know they call him the new Elijah in the text and

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:47.920
they even Elijah also is the guy in the wilderness blah blah blah blah blah but

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:56.000
then there's the baptism aspect and the you know him wearing the the animal skins and doing baptisms in the desert

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:02.520
or in the wilderness that is that is that is almost exactly what we see with these Baptists calls all over Greece

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:09.319
these worshippers of dionis and kotus they call themselves Baptists and they wear animal skins so there's two

00:54:09.319 --> 00:54:16.200
elements there with with with John and and by the way Elijah might even be earlier than that doing that same

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:22.680
drawing from those Baptists so that might be why he's so much like Elijah and the

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:30.240
Baptist let's not forget that Elijah is later Elijah's not written there's no text about Elijah from 600 that's like

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:35.599
four 400 300 BC that's it that's not Elijah's not that old oh wait wait can I

00:54:35.599 --> 00:54:42.400
can I burst I'm sorry I'll shut up after this but this is so apropo in the in the beginning of

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:47.880
Mark in the beginning of Mark the first thing he opens up with is a quote and he

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:56.440
quotes Isaiah do he quotes Isaiah directly word for word from the

00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:03.359
now if you have if you believe the the judeo-christian myth what you think is

00:55:03.359 --> 00:55:10.640
that Mark the mark the writer of the Gospel is quoting because his native

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:18.040
language is either Aramaic or Hebrew they argue back and forth what what they think it wasn't it was Greek it was but

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:25.200
here's what they think he was speaking Aramaic he's quoting Greek from a Hebrew

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:31.359
text right it's not true but when he quotes the Hebrew text and writes it in

00:55:31.359 --> 00:55:37.480
Greek he writes it exactly like the sep let me one up you let me one up you real

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:44.640
quick every time in the New Testament whether it's in any gospel or in an epistle or in Revelation wherever

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:51.440
anytime there's a quote from the Tanakh or from the prophets every 100% it's

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:56.640
from the septu agent never do they ever call off the septu agent

00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:03.319
I just wanted to point out too that this image of Elijah this this idea of the wild man in the woods who's who's gone

00:56:03.319 --> 00:56:09.000
off to go live a life of kind of like monasticism in pursuit of divinity this

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.119
is a Trope we see all over the place right you have all of the wild men of Europe you have a Shiva and the various

00:56:16.119 --> 00:56:21.640
even earlier Proto shivas that we see in Hara you know so to me like when I see

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:26.680
like wild man in the wilderness doing sex rights and drugs like like that that

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:32.960
that yeah that's what John is and also we know like in that area is H in and

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:39.640
some Scholars have pointed out that Mary Salam is connected to this is the is the cult of Heracles but specifically it's

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:48.480
the uh what's that version Dion we did a video on this a while back it was uh it's not just Heracles but uh melart

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:54.240
melart Heracles and by the way melart well I was talking about the palm tree

00:56:54.240 --> 00:57:00.319
myth that's in the Quran and at delos with Leto and also with Mary in the

00:57:00.319 --> 00:57:05.359
Bible milart remember he finds that Island out there with the Olive Tree

00:57:05.359 --> 00:57:13.839
that's moving around and that's it deals with the purple The Olive Tree in the island of milar that's a whole aspect of

00:57:13.839 --> 00:57:18.960
that Magic Tree you know the phix in Greek the phix um is the way of

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:25.359
referring to a palm tree I don't know if that's I don't know if that's related or not to be honest but I I think it also

00:57:25.359 --> 00:57:32.880
has to do with this image of the winnowing fan too that we see and in in Odus and also like of the sale what's

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:38.920
going on with this because there's the cross of the sail that odys is hung on and then when he sees tyresius he sees

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:46.039
the same image but tyresius tells him it's not a cross it's a winnowing fan that he has to go Inland to find this

00:57:46.039 --> 00:57:51.440
cross and that's the cross marks where the drugs are and then he finds the fan

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:58.480
crossed in the ground you know so there's some we weird stuff going on with this image of the cross that well

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:03.559
well predates Christ he's a total wizard too people don't realize that odsis is a

00:58:03.559 --> 00:58:10.200
total wizard the first time we see him he's out looking for the bow poison the arrow poison because that's the thing

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:15.359
people don't realize that um when we're saying the purple we're talking about a

00:58:15.359 --> 00:58:21.920
compound that is using this DMT containing um purple dive that is used

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:27.520
in the trade but the burning purple is a version of that that contains these

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:35.920
Arrow poisons that odius is looking for from the very beginning and the dude odius goes to says no no way man this

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:43.280
stuff is way too potent for you right this is odys that he's talking to when

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:49.160
Jason comes to media on that first ship when he gets there to do his pirate

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:55.240
thing and abduct her he's it says specifically um

00:58:55.240 --> 00:59:01.880
that he has a knowledge of drugs that although is not as good as medas is good

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:08.240
compared to the rest of the world those thesans he's a thesan those people were

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:15.119
you know palasi and Offspring and they were supposed to have a knowledge of the drugs right everybody says all the

00:59:15.119 --> 00:59:21.400
witches come from thessaly right the the the phrase in Antiquity a thesan woman

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:26.599
was the way they said a thesan witch and that's like the flyover country between

00:59:26.599 --> 00:59:32.319
Macedonia and Athens so and there's also this weird stuff like I've even seen

00:59:32.319 --> 00:59:38.280
coins with odys like this his arm stretched across the masts on his boat

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:44.119
in a crucifixion pose like you know like to think that like all of the Christian

00:59:44.119 --> 00:59:49.240
imagery is coming from earlier sources you know they're just inverting I'm not

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:56.680
saying that Christianity is not an original idea but I'm saying that like all cultural ideas is it comes out of

00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:04.280
the cultural framework in which it exists and plays with the images that are at its disposal you know

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:10.079
yeah I thought that was brilliant Dion what you said with the trinium and kind

01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:15.640
of looking at the at the dining and the feasting because it does become a

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:22.799
sticking issue of Scandal in Gospel of Mark they are asking him why are you

01:00:22.799 --> 01:00:30.520
reclining why are you laying down with all of these um prostitutes and you know

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.720
you you've got your pimp there you got your tax pimp there and you know what's

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:42.200
going on and it's not just Matthew he's hanging around with by the way it says telon it's plural right he's got

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:49.680
numerous people from you know within the culture of the child trade or what we're

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:56.720
calling Pirates yeah he they could you know they I just don't understand tell

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:02.000
me why it is with everything that you just laid out Dion why is it that we

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.960
can't see um what Jesus was actually doing I mean you know why what where is

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:15.079
it programming is it just years and years and years of a false narrative

01:01:15.079 --> 01:01:23.440
what yep and that works with every religion because that's why people would do Jihad in Islamic countries because

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:29.240
they they they believe in virgins and going to a magical place the story is so

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:37.280
thick that's why it has to start with children that's why this is a children's story we're telling you know it's about

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:44.359
indoctrinating when you're a child so you can believe that that's why the numbers are declining in in a lot of

01:01:44.359 --> 01:01:50.559
religions because people don't believe it as adults you have to be IND doated as a child to believe it yeah that's a

01:01:50.559 --> 01:01:58.400
big Point that's a really big point you know so I think that's a big part of it you know and the other part of it why

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:04.480
you can't see all this stuff is because the word love because there's an aspect

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:10.880
of love in the story and we we all want and believe in some type of love that we

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:16.079
want to share and can heal so we think ah well I don't want to really know

01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:21.520
about that stuff there's the love and so you put the blinders on and

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:27.880
then it's also this one thing we see with a lot of these religions that survive the test of time are these

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:33.799
stories of persecution okay these shared stories of A persecuted idea you know

01:02:33.799 --> 01:02:40.760
when you really go after someone and you try to destroy something that they believe in they almost always double

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:48.799
down on it and people love those kinds of stories of Oppression of overcoming Mar you notice like you know

01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:54.319
it blows my mind that the Christians in America who are the vast majority in

01:02:54.319 --> 01:02:59.720
control of everything still paint themselves always as the Eternal victim

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:06.039
always everyone is out to get them everyone's legislating against them which is couldn't be further from the

01:03:06.039 --> 01:03:11.559
truth you know but it suits that narrative it allows them to maintain

01:03:11.559 --> 01:03:17.839
their their their vision of reality it's all about these stories you know stories of

01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:24.640
control and you've talked about this a lot on your channel Neil is it it goes back a lot to Plato and this idea this

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:29.960
Noble lie right taking the the people who are ignorant who can't understand

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:36.640
things and just telling them a good story so that you can keep them under your thumb you know yeah I don't blame

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:43.039
Plato exactly but he Sparks this idea you know I do I do I think I think he's

01:03:43.039 --> 01:03:50.039
the reason why we have a judeo-christian world because he he says it right in his right in his own text in book three he

01:03:50.039 --> 01:03:56.400
obviously uses Socrates to do it but that's not Socrates saying Socrates is not dog he doesn't care about nothing he

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:01.599
just cares about engaging in reasonable discussions and having two opposite

01:04:01.599 --> 01:04:06.920
sides duke it out he loves that he loves that that that that debate but Plato is

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:13.079
saying that Homer needs to be replaced with a better better find myth that that

01:04:13.079 --> 01:04:18.160
children can grow up in that will uh shape them into better people that are

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:23.640
and and they'll they'll they'll they'll be subservient to their higher philosopher king and all the stuff that

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:30.480
he's saying is like lines up with what judeo Christianity wants you want Pope on top you have his Bishops underneath

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:36.079
they're they're controlling the noble lies and then underneath that is a bunch of indoctrinated children doing as

01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:43.880
they're told and being told if you're a good boy you go to heaven if you're bad you go to hell Homer like that

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:49.799
Homer not a philosopher king right yeah exactly it's the philosopher king and and then you see how he's objectively

01:04:49.799 --> 01:04:55.960
wrong now that we've had enough time to see which world was better the world of Homer in the world of Plato we know that

01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:01.559
he was wrong PL whatever Homer did to shape the world with these myths and and

01:05:01.559 --> 01:05:07.400
people people and nii talks about this too it's the dionan aspect the tragedy

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:13.119
because life is not just all good and peaches and and cream and everything's good you're going to live this world

01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:18.880
life and go to heaven and that's the end of it no life is tragic there's there there are there's there's Darkness and

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:24.640
Light there's two sides of this thing and to have to not have one side of that is detrimental to a

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:31.520
iety exactly right and the Christians they do this in more than one ways they ex they remove the feminine they remove

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:38.200
the black everything is all peace love and forgiveness that's not reality that's not reality and the Ancients were

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:45.200
totally invested right they believe in the myth of eternal life there is no eternal life everything must die and be

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:51.720
reborn and reassembled to live is to die these are these are two mirrored images in the Pagan world right everything is

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:59.359
seen in these mirrored images and like the Christians have the or and through Plato totally subverted that but what I

01:05:59.359 --> 01:06:04.520
see in the philosophical world is we have first is you got heraclitus and

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:10.039
heraclitus causes the original doubt he is able to prove that only change is

01:06:10.039 --> 01:06:17.240
real and after this everyone freaks out this leads to Socrates who takes it a step further and he applies that to

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:22.559
dialogue where he presses uncertainty he challenges everyone who says they know

01:06:22.559 --> 01:06:27.839
truth or certainty that's his main point is to point out that only change is

01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:35.039
certain and as soon as you extend things into time anything that you profess a certain falls apart you know because if

01:06:35.039 --> 01:06:41.279
you go back too far or you think too far ahead it doesn't apply anymore you know but the problem is is then Plato is

01:06:41.279 --> 01:06:47.839
building off of this what do we do now that our foundation has been racked that truth has been proven to be an

01:06:47.839 --> 01:06:54.680
impossibility you know we can't understand the totality they call it the incomprehensibility exactly what do we

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:59.799
do with that and Plato solution is well only some of us can understand and can

01:06:59.799 --> 01:07:06.279
deal with the tragedy of incomprehensibility right and we need to lie to people whereas

01:07:06.279 --> 01:07:13.319
Homer everyone else yeah exactly we need to embrace the tragedy of life we need to embrace the uncertainty we need to be

01:07:13.319 --> 01:07:18.480
challenged by this and accept our limitations that's the Pagan world you

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:24.640
know accept them and try to overcome them through the extension of ourselves right whereas a Chans want to stick

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:31.720
their head in the sand anyway s well no you made a really good point there because in the in the Pagan sense and

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:36.880
I'm only using Pagan as like a I'm looking at how the Christians would call them they're all different they're not

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:43.279
we're all pagans no there's there's dionan Cults there's uh Aphrodite like there's different temples everywhere

01:07:43.279 --> 01:07:48.480
they're just people free living by the way so whatever I'm going to call them Pagan for now in the Pagan sense you're

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:54.839
a part of nature you're in it you're one of the you're one of these cogs of nature that are part of this Grand thing

01:07:54.839 --> 01:08:01.279
but in Christianity sense you you you literally take apart take yourself out of that and you become above it you

01:08:01.279 --> 01:08:08.440
become there's a separation separate thing from everything else world is evil you're Divine world is evil you're saved

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:14.319
and I don't that that that that's sets up a really disastrous setting to live

01:08:14.319 --> 01:08:19.440
in the fundamental end goal of Christianity is the establishment of a

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:25.120
total hierarchy that exists unchanging through all time who benefits from a

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:31.238
total unchanging hierarchy only those on the top the rest of us are perpetually on the bottom you know and then they

01:08:31.239 --> 01:08:37.199
have all these creepy myths like only a hundred and some thousand get to rule over the rest of us and Lord it over but

01:08:37.199 --> 01:08:43.359
that's really what they want and this is you see this throughout all of the abrahamic religions to stop the Cycles

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:50.640
to stop death like they're totally devoid of nature it's a war against nature right when I first read the Greek

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:56.040
alexand real quick when I first read the Greek Alexander romance and I they talk about how I don't know actually I think

01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:01.480
it was Aryan not the Greek Alexander romance that Aryan when he wrote about Alexander yeah it is Aryan never mind

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:08.480
when aryion said that uh Alexander stomped out every single fire temple zoroastrian Fire temple that he came

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:14.880
across on his travels and wanted to like extinguish that religion my first response was wow that's kind of that's

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:20.679
kind of rough like why was he but now I sort of sort of under I'm like I'm not saying I would do that but like in a

01:09:20.679 --> 01:09:26.400
weird way I'm like I see why he was doing that he saw this he saw this

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:32.758
monotheistic religion as something that's just going to be terrible for everything and he wanted to end it he he

01:09:32.759 --> 01:09:39.920
was pretty rough about it to be honest but I'm just saying like I kind of get what he was doing if you can put somebody through a

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:46.120
series of um initiatory events that include drugs um

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:52.480
exercise um physical things happening to your body um and you can allow them to

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:58.480
see death and then bring them back to life if you can take them beyond what

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.920
what is death um you can raise them to a level that they can never be a

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:10.760
monotheist right it's the whole idea of the mystery religions is that you were

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:18.000
born into a new understanding that you have right you finally know yourself and

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.560
like Cicero can say yeah everybody's got to do this once it's a if you think about it the oracular Mysteries were

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:33.080
established to prevent this kind of corruption this monatic Corruption of

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:40.159
the system which does somehow degenerate into the individual and the individual's

01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:47.040
entitlement and where you go from there is is the loss of civilization um if you it's kind of

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:52.760
weird to think about Christianity as being the focus of entitlement but if

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:59.800
you are the one who follows the one God who has the one power and you're going to the one Heaven

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:06.320
there's nothing more entitled than that you power it's powerful yeah you can persecute anybody else you want doesn't

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:12.040
matter if they're gender switchers doesn't matter if they're from the North or from the south it doesn't matter you

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:19.960
can persecute anyone Manifest Destiny they call it it's their it's we're the We're The Chosen chosen save saved ones

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:25.159
under Christ and we're going to go into this new land and we're just going to take it all the resources and they can

01:11:25.159 --> 01:11:32.040
either get baptized or die and they had they really felt that was the way they really thought that and and like you're

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:37.280
demonic in wicked and evil Hellbound if you're not one of us that's a really

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:42.360
it's you like to wrap your head around how atrocious that is for a society to

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:49.080
think like that it's mindblowing think about it this way we're just talking about Socrates this is one of the most

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:54.199
celebrated figures in all of Greco Roman history okay

01:11:54.199 --> 01:12:02.440
he is well known as a huge pot smoker a lazy lout who doesn't work you know and

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:09.520
also for being possessed by a demon who he talks to on the regular okay in the

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:17.080
RO in the Greek and Roman worlds these are facts are celebrated about the man celebrated like diogenes too okay great

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:24.120
diogenes too right in the Christian world this guy is the absolute evil right they take possession they like

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:31.000
they saw Socrates as somewhat special he went through this traumatic War experience but came out possessed you

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.280
know everyone wanted a Dione you know and now under the Christian rule being

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:42.320
possessed is literally the worst thing that can happen to you and we have to go out and abuse orphan children to prevent

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:49.760
them from turning into oracles whoa Zen zenfon said that Socrates would just be in the corner

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:57.320
looking up at the wall just talking like a normal conversation like he had a Dame on and he was it was for real like he

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.920
was seeing something and he this is the smartest man who ever lived this is the

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:09.960
ideal person that we're all supposed to strive after the scientific method is based off Socratic method the potm

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:16.639
smoking guy who sat around in the marketplace telling everyone they didn't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

01:13:16.639 --> 01:13:23.040
okay that's that's Socrates you know whose wife is constantly like we're on the verge of bankruptcy can't you get a

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:29.400
job can't you get some of these young students give you some of their money they all say that you're so great why

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:36.239
isn't that turning into money for us and he ends up he ends up getting in trouble for corrupting those youth you know and

01:13:36.239 --> 01:13:43.760
introducing New Gods but despite that the Oracle which is their Pinnacle the

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:49.159
Bronze Age Pinnacle I mean oracles ultimately produce the museum and um

01:13:49.159 --> 01:13:57.760
everything that we have that comes from the University from that um these oracles were wise enough right to to be

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:02.800
able to say hey this guy who says he doesn't know he's the smartest one of

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:09.719
you idiots yeah I mean those those women that ruled that we don't even appreciate

01:14:09.719 --> 01:14:16.120
our our um feminist Scholars tell us they never existed don't pay attention

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:23.000
to this feminine power we're all oppressed all that stupid 60s ideology

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.520
that bled into the scholarship and bled into the everything from Biblical

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:34.120
scholarship to Classics and I tell you what if I hear one more paper if I were

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:39.679
hear one more paper about the oppression of women I'm gonna say do you recognize

01:14:39.679 --> 01:14:46.280
that odius is one two three how many women slave is he how how many women

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:52.120
he's crying in the first scene he's on the beach crying cuz please let me go

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:59.480
you turned all my men into slaves right you drug them all and turn them slaves please help us and she's like no no baby

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:05.960
right you got to come to me first right and she gets out of him what she wants and then ultimately releases him right

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:11.440
right but wait a minute women had no women had no power in Antiquity right no

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:17.239
don't believe the academics they're pulling a reputation and a product that's it or look at Olympus having

01:15:17.239 --> 01:15:23.639
power over her own captors when they tried to capture her after the Civil War broke out she had power like there's

01:15:23.639 --> 01:15:30.679
women that had insane amounts of power in the ancient world this has always been a Trope where we underestimate you

01:15:30.679 --> 01:15:37.639
know you know here's the thing is that there's a lot of people who are trafficked and treated like property in

01:15:37.639 --> 01:15:44.520
the ancient world and there's a lot of extreme oppression and violence we're not saying that but that doesn't mean

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:50.639
that women aren't able to rise especially smart and Powerful women aren't able to rise to positions of

01:15:50.639 --> 01:15:57.199
authority and power right like the Oracle at Deli right this is the

01:15:57.199 --> 01:16:02.280
most important person in the Mediterranean world for how long like

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:09.480
6,000 years like what you know and what and you're going to tell me that this is just some illiterate teenager what about

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:15.520
all the women behind her who's running the temple you're right teaching all of the writing of the languages right like

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.960
we hear all of this stuff like you have to read between the lines you know well

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:28.199
you know I'm um once again I'm going to bring up the word torsus where Paul's from and the and the Pirates yeah that's

01:16:28.199 --> 01:16:36.120
where Cleopatra pulled up in a boat yeah and Mark anony had to go out there on the boat and talk to her she you know

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:43.920
and they call that today there in Turkey the Cleopatra Gates they say that's where she pulled up and well she was she

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:50.199
they had the she had control over that whole entire region of the world and that that's where Mark Anthony

01:16:50.199 --> 01:16:55.719
really rose up as he called himself an emperor he called himself imperator Mark Anthony he wasn't he was really

01:16:55.719 --> 01:17:02.480
technically he kind of was the first real emperor of the Roman Empire and he could if he if he didn't

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:08.679
if he would have won the war against an Octavian he really would have been the big but like he called him he styled

01:17:08.679 --> 01:17:14.080
himself as the imperator and then he all those lands in the East turkey Judea

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:21.560
Syria Egypt that was all Cleopatra's they call them the donations of Cleopatra and she set up her sons the

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:27.080
children she had Mark Anthony as Kings and Queens over all those lands that's how it was they they set up an Empire

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:32.800
over there oh yeah and and it started when he stepped on the

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:40.280
boat yep you know and it's it's also have a famous painting about that too where they show Mark Anthony walking over to the boat Cleopatra in this

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:46.360
amazing glorious boat with like purple robes and golden stuff all and this dude

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:51.639
it was you're right that was a very that's like a caesar Crossing the Rubicon scene right there that's a

01:17:51.639 --> 01:17:57.960
historical event I always think too like if we look at Babylon and we look at a lot of the writings about Babylon like

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:03.960
uh in the Syrian goddess with Lucien he's talking about samaris building these massive walls and being this

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:11.960
extraordinarily powerful Queen ruling through her children having thousands of Unix making statues of herself depicted

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:17.080
as Venus as a starte you know and then also they talk about all of these

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:23.800
powerful women who are basically like it really reminds me of some of these women you see today who are powerful through

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:29.440
only fans and whatnot but they talk about these women who have all these men giving them gifts just cuz they're

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:37.120
beautiful and they have independent households and they're not married they just have hundreds of suitors the C look

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:43.400
at the civilist they're they're these these women are writing texts that become foundational Christian

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:49.440
texts and there's like there's sybles all over the all over the Roman Empire even outside of the Roman Empire you

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:57.320
have symbols makes me wonder too about what um the power Dynamic was um that you

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:04.239
could get I mean think about that island that posidonius writes about that Neil was talking about yeah I mean okay so

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:10.840
they come to the mainland and we know they may be connected to the amazonians or at least to the tribes that around

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:15.960
the Black Sea so they're going to have the same Customs which means their women

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:23.280
are killers right when when you only have women in your Society your military has to be women and you know they have

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:29.520
rules about how many women you gotta how many men you got to kill before you can have a child it makes me wonder in these

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:36.159
civilizations if I'm a dude walking around in Antiquity and here come the Raiders right here come the raiding

01:19:36.159 --> 01:19:42.159
women um from the the island right okay so they're gonna eat your baby if it's

01:19:42.159 --> 01:19:47.239
if it's masculine okay it's their custom right what you got to think why would

01:19:47.239 --> 01:19:52.960
you you know we kind of we flew by that one a little too fast why would you be

01:19:52.960 --> 01:20:00.280
eating right you guys all hear the bakic um the bakic uh procession here these

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:07.639
Meads are tearing apart pentheus right they're tearing apart their own children

01:20:07.639 --> 01:20:12.679
and people say well this they couldn't have done this the oh it's terrible and the Greeks are like well we don't do

01:20:12.679 --> 01:20:20.360
that anymore but um what about these women if I'm a dude walking around Antiquity and I see these women if I'm

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:26.800
not associated with some kind of town or guard or something I'm liable to get killed by

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:34.360
him or raped by him and then killed maybe um but how do we how do we as

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:41.000
moderns look back on that society and have the guts to say the ancient world

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:48.080
was a place where women were not respected and they were for forced to stay at home you shut up you have no

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:54.600
idea what you're talking about it just to give some of these feminists a slight pass we have to remember we're on the

01:20:54.600 --> 01:21:02.880
other side of the greatest genocide in human history that was conducted by the Christians where they removed women from

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:09.320
society and instituted these patriarchal Frameworks which dominate cultures everywhere today and we have to talk

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:15.960
like I was just reading a book about the about the witch trials and the persecution of witches directly led to

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:21.239
the black plague because they killed all the cats and they killed all the practitioners of

01:21:21.239 --> 01:21:28.719
medicine that's what happened you know there's a direct correlation to these kinds of violent there was such loss why

01:21:28.719 --> 01:21:34.400
do you think that when somebody's being um unfairly attacked by someone they call it a wit it's a Witch Hunt they're

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:40.719
after me it's a Witch Hunt the reason why is because that's what they were doing they were singling out regular pag

01:21:40.719 --> 01:21:47.000
Pagan women that were not doing anything wrong calling them witches putting them on trial killing them Witch Hunt you

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:53.280
know and it's like the problem is is that it's you know there had to be this feminist movement that had to set a lot

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:59.920
of the records straight and to explore a lot of this stuff but it's become you know corrupted in and of its own self

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:06.120
you know it's starting to be too much about an ideology and less about trying to uncover the actual truth you know but

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:12.040
it is a necessary reaction to extreme violence and oppression and these ideas

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:18.800
are still needed today and are continuing to evolve and adapt and get better you know not every single you

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:24.199
know like Ammon you brought up that one scholar there um but her book her work

01:22:24.199 --> 01:22:30.320
is actually pretty good in other regards you know you know what I mean like when it comes to the Roman she she's kind of

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:37.159
a mix I'm trying to remember her name but she's she's well known her work on Roman religions is a f

01:22:37.159 --> 01:22:42.960
phenomenal exactly yeah no no that well the reason

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:48.280
why I like that TCH there's a two book Source book that's called Roman religion Source book and it's the reason why I

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:53.440
love it so much it's just sources put in one place very actually I

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:58.880
shouldn't say that there's a lot of her own her own um you know t uh speaking on

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:06.360
the matters but like major the majority of these she's just giving you the sources I very valuable text but I do I

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:12.440
do think see why Amon has that um there it is yeah that's a good text dude it's a great text oh for sure like Ammon is

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:19.560
right in his criticism when it comes to to to to the her presentation of women it's extraordinarily biased right it's

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:27.000
only focusing on um the working lot of the workingclass women and it's it's it's taking out the problem too when a

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.960
lot of these people are talking about Greek society I always go when where which city which time period you're

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:40.639
talking about one of the longest lived empires in human flipping history with dozens of city states spread across the

01:23:40.639 --> 01:23:49.400
islands Ania I just thought something to in that Source book she herself talks about how

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:54.719
um oh what the hell is Julia DNA is worst as a goddess in her own time was

01:23:54.719 --> 01:24:01.239
the like she she's even bringing up her own she I don't even think she realized it she's bringing up examples of women

01:24:01.239 --> 01:24:06.800
being worshiped like Jesus Julia DNA they said that she was Athena incarnate

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:11.920
and she had her own like Temple and everything so like there is an example like I don't know it's in her own text

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:17.360
so I'm just saying right you know what it is is that we don't and this is true we don't see a

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:25.040
lot of material culture that survives that is written by women from a female perspective you know and like like there

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:31.800
is a lot like I wonder I honestly wonder about things like what's going on with the mads I wish we had firstand accounts

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:38.000
from the main ads themselves because so much of this is going to be reactionary men who aren't allowed to participate

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.119
under death just making up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to try and go after women we see this all the

01:24:43.119 --> 01:24:48.960
time so why would it be any different you know you got well you do have the civilist that are women then you have uh

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:54.520
what's her name from Lesbos um safo saf there there's there's women in there I

01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:00.800
mean I get what you're saying though it's there could be more it's like sure what I mean is just that there's not a lot of firsthand accounts from women who

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:08.480
are doing the rights that have survived to us right and a lot of the accounts about the women are from men for and and

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:14.119
it's a lot of like reactionary stuff sure sure you know so if I could say one

01:25:14.119 --> 01:25:19.679
thing real quick is was Jesus castrated

01:25:19.679 --> 01:25:25.920
oh getting his back on top of TS no but no but it's the same topic that's what we're talking about

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:34.360
feminization he didn't have any we're talking about the goddess and and Apostle John the

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:39.639
twins there the the the goddess is always there you can't sanitize the

01:25:39.639 --> 01:25:46.400
goddess so these men have to take on the goddess

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:52.920
role so the imagery with at least with with with John the Beloved is so on the

01:25:52.920 --> 01:26:01.239
nose he's got the long hair he's got the the clean shaven face he's we he has the cup of snakes and then like it's almost

01:26:01.239 --> 01:26:06.960
certain that he's at least a galloy I don't know about Jesus though Emon You' you've brought up a couple sources and I

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:12.159
know we've talked about this because I had mentioned it to you and you were like the sources don't fully confirm but

01:26:12.159 --> 01:26:17.920
what do you think yeah I would like to see the description of him when he was castrated

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:25.320
I would love that I would love you know under what circumstances when he was down in Egypt he had all that trust fund

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:31.080
money that the Magi gave him he's they pushed him into the drugs they gave him

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:38.600
both the bases that he needed for all the magic drugs you know he's off there in Egypt and he comes back notice that

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:43.920
he comes back and he doesn't walk in a town like you know he's Henry Caville or

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:49.880
something right he doesn't walk in and take the town um he comes into town and

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:55.159
goes to the teaching centers and there they say oh my God this kid is teaching

01:26:55.159 --> 01:27:01.119
like he's oh my God what's and Christians say oh well it's because he's pump full of

01:27:01.119 --> 01:27:06.679
the power of God baby and the logos just talks out of them right no um what's I'm

01:27:06.679 --> 01:27:13.600
sorry but that's the fairy tale what's much more likely historically is that he was educated in Egypt now the question

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:20.199
is is he if he's getting a Priestly education he may have been a unic how

01:27:20.199 --> 01:27:27.600
would we know this if he is using terminology that is Central to what Unix

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:33.960
are going to be encountering and living with them if he's a if we're able to pull out those words and when he uses

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:39.679
certain titles right why is he using this title when he's doing something

01:27:39.679 --> 01:27:45.520
that's a little bit too much like the great mother worship right where he's

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:52.360
putting himself in the position of Addis is that why he's with that kid in the end because the kid is the cup and

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:59.679
people don't realize the child is the cup lady Babylon that thing that we that

01:27:59.679 --> 01:28:05.000
that word that we use that I never like to use [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right but I'm quoting what

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:12.440
you know she's called um that way of looking at her is the same eyes that are

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:18.000
looking at the pidis that child prostitute girl that comes up to Peter

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:24.800
and says hey you're one of his boys right um it's the same spirit that

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:30.400
pidis you see it bleeding through so when Jesus is with his boy is there any

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:37.960
way to tell whether or not he's castrated and that's why I say Snappy I don't um I

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:44.360
don't I you're right there is a lot of there is a lot of parallels but you're right I haven't seen direct evidence I

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:50.040
keep thinking of like we talked about this Dion on occult explorers is what's that Jewish figure who goes through the

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:55.199
oracular Mysteries and is cast frustrated what's that what's that text I'm having trouble remembering that's

01:28:55.199 --> 01:29:00.600
isn't that Daniel Daniel yeah and and um

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:06.960
and Ash right Jesus is

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:12.920
doing horse's nose yeah what Sor about the nose I missed that sorry horse's nose what

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:18.600
ashpan means that's the UN the the priest he's the prince of the Unix that

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:25.960
helps convert him through a diet it's a special diet has to undergo and he says I don't want to do the diet you know he

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:33.480
don't want to drink the cup they never want to drink the Cup by the way kelus points out that he's from his sources

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:40.320
and he said he I forgot what he says but he says he he cites like Jewish historians living in the time of Jesus

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:46.199
uh saying that he did move to Egypt and then came back educated to want and wanted to prove himself as M the

01:29:46.199 --> 01:29:52.639
educated he even says that kelus like why would kelus just make that up you know what I mean

01:29:52.639 --> 01:29:57.760
by the way kis is not a late tax that's an early 150 that's early that's to me

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:04.159
that's I'm taking that serious I'm looking at that because he does not it's always good to have a hostile source to

01:30:04.159 --> 01:30:10.159
get the truth you want you don't want to just read the Christian Church fathers to hear what they want to say let's look

01:30:10.159 --> 01:30:17.159
let's see what the Hostile sources say kelus is early kelus is and he and here's the thing about Kelis he knows a

01:30:17.159 --> 01:30:22.560
lot about Christianity why do I know that because he starts naming off all their different names of the sect of

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:28.239
Christians that exist he knows more about Christians than Paul does Paul is not naming off different sects of

01:30:28.239 --> 01:30:33.960
Christianity he's just going on on some like trip that he's having like he's just talking about all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:40.320
but celus is like picking this thing apart and say Here's the group of simonian these are the civilist those

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:46.960
are the marianites he knows all about them so if I'm taking what he says serious when he says stuff his father

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:55.000
was probably a Roman soldier named panta and he moved to Egypt and got educated you're talking about paulus AKA Saul Now

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.840
imagine when Saul pulls up and he prophesies that's why the method they were

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:07.040
using kidnapping boys to go sell them at the at the ports for double you know

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:13.840
that's a tough that's a tough sell but if I can prophesy and get you to join something for Magical experience take

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:20.560
you on the boat and then sell you and then just come back and get a whole new crew you know because like you said the

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:27.119
slaves in Judea were were twice as much if you get them up to Tyre and you get them up to closer to Turkey then if you

01:31:27.119 --> 01:31:32.880
get them to Rome they were triple depends tax report depends on how

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:38.760
good-look they are too right because you know and people don't people don't understand this because you've never

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:45.520
been in a slave market right but there is a difference in quality between

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:52.159
humans you can put a price on it and they know a virgin and this is what the

01:31:52.159 --> 01:31:58.280
thians this is why the thians were dealing in The Virgins the highest priced thing you're going to get is a

01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:04.920
virgin boy or girl who is just reaching their ripening their complete um

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:11.960
ripeness for adulthood that's the way they looked at it it's for us it's no it's still in your minority right but

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:18.199
for them as soon as you were entering that pubertal capacity then you were you

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:25.639
were ripe for the picking and that's they knew those fetch the highest price in market right those those and the rich

01:32:25.639 --> 01:32:31.400
ones a functional unic that that has undergone the surgery

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:37.840
the castration and they didn't die and now they can't get the mrss pregnant the

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:43.960
Mistress of the house and they can function in a feminine and a masculine

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:51.800
capacity and here's the thing too if you get the child young enough and you do the the the the castration young enough

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:58.560
what ends up happening is they don't fully develop they stay youthful they maintain that falsetto voice you know

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:04.679
they wind up they they're they're and if they do it where they're just like they do in the in the GRE Greco Roman style

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:10.520
words just the the testes they're able to have sex they could be sex slaves so

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:17.560
often these Unix were used as sex slaves by high powerered women and men you

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:23.119
know that's the whole story of Cersei right so the whole story she has a whole

01:33:23.119 --> 01:33:29.000
room full of drugged men that she has sex with right Isn't that cool I mean

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:35.719
cool in a way like I don't know maybe you want to go there I mean it could things could be worse right they say

01:33:35.719 --> 01:33:42.080
that people people um pill p pilgrimage to culus to get the bath of media it was

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:47.360
a it was like she was she invented baptism basically she had this like real

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:53.440
first time they would learn how to like heat up water and use it as a ritual bath they they credit media harus says

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:59.800
media invented that she is so full of drugs she is so full of drugs that you

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:05.679
can give her a liquid bath right with water and that offs scoring that they

01:34:05.679 --> 01:34:12.400
wash off of her is considered a medicine whoa It's considered a medicine you can

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:18.880
take it and it will do things to you I mean that you understand the person is

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:24.560
the cup in this Bronze Age religion the person is producing those those

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:30.600
chemicals that are causing you to be able to enter into communion right that's why you you have it that's why it

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:37.840
has to be connected with porna in in Revelation it's a cup of sexual juices

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:44.199
right how are you going to produce sexual juices unless you're having intercourse right and they talk about

01:34:44.199 --> 01:34:52.760
the model in the Middle Ages and Michelle writes about this one is the Priestess over the tripod and she is

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:57.920
actually producing that communion into the tripod which is then administered to

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:03.159
the group but we know that her phus that she's using and everybody's shocked

01:35:03.159 --> 01:35:08.520
don't be shocked the basket that is the most sacred aspect The Arc of the

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:15.520
Covenant of bakic worship contains a poisonous Serpent and a

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:21.920
dildo whoa yeah you guys you Neil Am I Wrong Am I Wrong about the Bas having

01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:27.000
the dildo and the serpent in it no and you know what it parallels what

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:33.800
we see in the Indian stuff with um with with SH Shiva is always the the F the

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:39.159
fallis the the stone pillar or the primordial Pillar of Fire and then the

01:35:39.159 --> 01:35:46.400
goddess Shakti is always the serpent that coils the pillar you know or forms the base of the pillar as a lotus flower

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:53.000
but it's either flower or snake it's a lot like the concept of Venus or Aphrodite and and bakus entwined they

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.560
call it the Lucifer entwined they give birth to priapus who is a fellis who is

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:04.840
a giant so like what's going on with that it's just a lot you know that's worth

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:10.400
the like And subscribe right there yeah if anything and a comment and a share

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:15.639
that that orphic hymn about protoganist the firstborn it's they calls him calls

01:36:15.639 --> 01:36:20.679
him fies and priapus what the hell's going on here so there's a lot of weird

01:36:20.679 --> 01:36:26.960
cultic stuff a lot to it too because there's also that mettis right there's the there's the phonies that's masculine

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:33.239
presenting and then there's mettis which is the female presenting but they're but they're both these B gendered

01:36:33.239 --> 01:36:38.560
animalistic you know amalgams yeah someone on Twitter um was

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:44.639
like some idiot on Twitter was writing about how in the ancient world they never did any of this modern stuff with

01:36:44.639 --> 01:36:51.480
trans and the and I just started throwing sources at them here's plany the Elder talking about uh transform ing

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:57.520
men to women and women to men and he's do they're not disgusted by it they're think this is they're like they this is

01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:04.360
breaking this is amazing science they talk about it like they're not like there's the that mentality is modern not

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:09.880
not the actual idea of it the mentality that's so against it is modern you we

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:15.880
like to view things through our lens as Ammon has pointed out numerous numerous times the Greeks have a very Nuance

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:23.000
conception of gender there's not just even three genders there's many genders there's masculine presenting women

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:29.800
there's feminine presenting men you know there's a lot of nuance here right and they're celebrating all of this very

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:36.080
diversity you know intersex people and hermaphrodites are a blessing from God

01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:42.679
her apodius was a goddess right like a very exactly and it's the combination of the

01:37:42.679 --> 01:37:48.360
two two of the most powerful deities Hermes and a Aphrodite right love and

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:54.960
communication I was talking about someone about this that the idea of having gods that represent different

01:37:54.960 --> 01:38:01.480
aspects of of um phenomena and natural history or natural um the natural world

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:07.159
to having a God that represents anybody like you have like whoever you are

01:38:07.159 --> 01:38:14.040
whatever you're like whatever you identify as there is a God for you that gives you representation in the world it

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:19.159
makes you feel better about yourself it gives you more power whereas when there's just one God and it's a man with

01:38:19.159 --> 01:38:24.400
a beard and he just that that only helps one type of person like think about the

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:31.320
patriarchal society only one person benefits from that you know what I mean like you sound like Socrates you sound

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:37.679
like Socrates Neil right everybody has a personal dime on you know I mean that's

01:38:37.679 --> 01:38:42.920
a think about that concept for a minute how revolutionary and how big that is

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:50.880
that you have access to a supernatural force that is in particular sync with

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:57.560
you you this is not an angel assigned to your wellbeing H tote tote right this is

01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:04.520
a Dione who very existence is like an invisible counterbalance to yours in

01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:09.719
this Dimension exactly I mean that's am talks about this a lot where it gets

01:39:09.719 --> 01:39:16.920
into this whole thing like this is the version of you outside of time that has completed all of the cycles and returned

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:22.159
back to the cosmic womb that has gone back to the one and it's here to show

01:39:22.159 --> 01:39:28.760
you what you need to learn to go through the cycles of life and death and to guide you so it's like a personal you

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:34.520
that's already the Supreme you know it's such a wild concept and you see this

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:41.000
reflected in many occult traditions because it's so Central you know

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:47.360
absolutely I think it's just physics I think it just comes down to quantum physics and however the universe is that

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:52.599
we can't see but what is behind that black hole and all the balance of the

01:39:52.599 --> 01:39:59.119
dark matter and everything and the How the Universe Works TimeWise gravity wise

01:39:59.119 --> 01:40:06.719
I people are people uh I don't think you you think about classical magic and you

01:40:06.719 --> 01:40:14.280
think um Disney and cartoons and you know miraculous things you don't think

01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:20.440
medicine and you don't think gender and you don't think PE um people using drugs

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:26.360
to ENT into a state of communion with the divine right we don't we don't think

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:32.080
in those terms anymore unless I don't know Dion some of us

01:40:32.639 --> 01:40:39.000
thinking just saying why not no it's wild right because like you

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:45.679
said you know like we have this cartoon vision so much of magic now has become about greed right it's it's you know all

01:40:45.679 --> 01:40:50.960
these people who are you know it's the secret it's it's like you see this I see

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:58.440
this all the time on online people saying I know a magic formula that'll get your ex to come back to you like the

01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:05.280
other day on everyone's just focused on that one thing like come on and meanwhile ancient magic is a lot like

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:12.320
psychology 90% of the time I'm reading about what they're doing at the Temple of excus and they're like okay come here

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:18.119
tell us your problems you know literally write it out as poetry go to sleep with

01:41:18.119 --> 01:41:24.480
these men with these snakes then tell us about your dreams as well and we're going to have a sit down conversation

01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:30.520
about your feelings and the art that you've just made how's it like the psychology it's art Carl Young Carl

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:36.440
Young said that that's ma ancient magic is Psy modern psychology pretty much

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:41.560
right the all of the magic that we see with especially the cult leise of

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:48.719
dionisis and N talks about this who you referenced earlier is all about affirmation of life it's about refirming

01:41:48.719 --> 01:41:54.159
this process and re putting yourself onto this path to accept the pain and

01:41:54.159 --> 01:42:01.280
the suffering that you have to go through because life is difficult and it is painful but you're stuck here you

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:09.239
know and there's two things that we can do you can stick your head in the sand and pretend and make up a story like the Christians do or you can try at least to

01:42:09.239 --> 01:42:17.040
try and figure out what what are you afraid of let's talk about it you know try and face it we the big difference to

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:23.760
me is like the holy mystery is all about experiencing Pan the all in the Greek

01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:29.119
side that is the goal who is Satan on the Christian side

01:42:29.119 --> 01:42:35.080
pan right the all one is all about acceptance one is all rejection you know

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:40.480
that image becomes everything that is evil when yeah when before it was nature

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:46.679
and that you're part of that nature yeah and if you're not separated from it it's not evil or different it's you are part

01:42:46.679 --> 01:42:54.800
of that like we don't like this uncomfortableness right because can also represents the Panic the violence the

01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:59.880
filth the excess but this is what it is to be alive you have to deal with those

01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:05.080
things all of our societies are defined by how we produ how we deal with excess

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:11.520
how we deal with violence you know how we try to persist you know and it's like

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:17.520
you know our modern society has disconnected ourselves from this you know and we we we try to pretend that

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:23.920
we're above nature rather than a part of it you know Gaia and you know Jordan Peterson always

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:29.360
likes to talk about how uh the uh postmodern Marxist types they worship

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:34.880
Gia well yeah we that's Gaia this is our planet why not why would why is that you

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.920
talk you just said it like that was some sort of own that's not an own like what

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:45.719
of course you have to treat Gaia well we live on Gaia you know yeah that's for

01:43:45.719 --> 01:43:51.199
sure right there but you hear a lot of these like fascists like who and a lot

01:43:51.199 --> 01:43:58.159
of these extremists who like there's a hatred that you see for the modern natural world right like I was listening

01:43:58.159 --> 01:44:04.000
to some Elon Musk and he literally talks about how no nature needs to be conquered and made subservient and we

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:11.599
need to conquer the stars and and and and and everything has to be put under our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thumb you know and it's like

01:44:11.599 --> 01:44:17.040
hubris the the the sheer hubris you know you know what that is he's a space

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:24.719
pirate y there you go you know well we're getting to the 2hour mark right here got

01:44:24.719 --> 01:44:31.159
to cut it sorry no I'm I'm having fun I'm glad that joined up that was quick

01:44:31.159 --> 01:44:36.719
to uh explore these saturnian Mysteries right here huh people wonder what the

01:44:36.719 --> 01:44:42.000
satanic all about that's per that's perfect Dion you

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:49.040
couldn't have ended it better by saying EXA he's a pirate yeah when you think about it my God man it's almost like

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:54.159
humanity is a struggle between two different directions and you can see the

01:44:54.159 --> 01:45:00.280
monad direction and you can see the free civilization direction and you know they

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:07.040
were yelling about let's not make it stop pirate Elon Musk Elon Musk you're a pirate space

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:12.360
pirate Donald Trump you're a pirate too you see these it's it's we're fighting

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:19.199
against these people who want to create their own narratives and put us as the secondary characters in their story you

01:45:19.199 --> 01:45:26.040
know that's what we're fighting against the the Christians are doing it these these Great Men great men are doing it

01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:33.280
and we need to rebel against that and return back to a natural reasoned approach you know not Bel believing in

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:38.960
fairy tales and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] making up mythologies about people you know they

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:45.360
said the wi saying to cut the myth they said the wisest the wisest

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:51.760
prophet in Antiquity tyresius was um wise because he was a able to be both

01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:58.440
male and female he got turned into a female at a certain time lived for a certain number of years and then got

01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:05.280
turned back into a male and so he had that perspective of being both they said

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:13.880
he was the one in all of all Mortals who would see once he was in the Underworld

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:19.280
he still saw because the shades don't see they're blind right but tyresius

01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:25.719
sees why because he's been both male and female imagine if it was a virtue if you

01:46:25.719 --> 01:46:31.599
say this to an Evangelical it burns their soul right um it's actually a

01:46:31.599 --> 01:46:38.119
virtue to understand both feminine and masculine and the person who does is a

01:46:38.119 --> 01:46:44.880
step ahead of everyone else makes sense amazing on that note guys like

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:50.400
