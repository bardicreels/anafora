00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:42.779
little Play-Doh every once in a while but he says look it cut me a break right and tell me how this works with

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:49.339
these groups of people the soldiers the lay Stace and the kleptos

00:12:49.339 --> 00:12:54.899
oh wait a minute the claptonos who were they that's the word for thief

00:12:54.899 --> 00:13:00.899
so when the Christians try to translate into English

00:13:00.899 --> 00:13:06.660
this word is Thief they don't know because they don't read

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.760
these texts right who which one can you tell me which one of your pastors has

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.339
ever read Plato okay now I'm not a big Plato fan right and that's unusual

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:24.320
that's unusual for somebody with a Classics background but I have uh I can't stand play though

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.940
yeah yeah but anywho um let's not bash play though he had a

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:36.959
muse so you know let's let's honor him that way um but uh what what you're seeing now

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:44.339
from Herodotus yeah um is the source of this

00:13:44.339 --> 00:13:51.180
thing called the lace days and they're different from thieves right some people

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:57.000
the Christians wanted to translate this so bad as Thief they did they they tried

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.120
Thief robber and conspirator conspirator

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:10.980
this is not this is not a conspiracy

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:20.519
yeah these are cultures this is a group of Thracians who do this right

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:26.339
remember the story we had a long time ago in the beginning about the thracian pirate

00:14:26.339 --> 00:14:33.540
who captured that beautiful young boy he put that young boy to sleep and when the

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.839
boy woke up he was a new creation

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:48.440
that pirate cut off his testicles

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:55.019
because some eunuchs choose

00:14:55.019 --> 00:15:01.019
and some don't yeah

00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:07.800
there's a reason the bandage was on the private parts of the naked boy that was

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:13.019
with Jesus when he was arrested there's a reason Mark tells you I'm bringing it

next next passage yeah so here it is I'm just gonna throw it all over the Bible I

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.600
think this is what Matthew one of Matthew's version um because it's in every gospel the

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.640
pirate is in every gospel right he's hanging between two Pirates one on his

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:06.480
left and one on his right this is Mark 14 48. bring it up yeah and Jesus

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:14.100
answered them and he said yeah why'd you come on against me like I'm a pirate with with weapons that are

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:21.179
military-grade weapons right that's a military sword that's meant to

00:18:21.179 --> 00:18:29.940
do not either run you through or chop your head off one of the two well let's do it disembowelment the Romans rent to

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:37.140
disembowelment that's how they get you right close um and then the Soul on that's a you

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:43.440
know something to smash your brains out with right it's uh it's somewhere

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:49.919
between a taser and a bullet yeah yeah

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:57.059
um definitely lethal Force he's like why'd you bring out this all out against me because you can see the pirate the

00:18:57.059 --> 00:19:04.940
lay station Antiquity was part of an association I'm part of a corrupt criminal

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:10.740
organization based upon different cultures

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:16.140

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:22.860
this is Bronze Age stuff people how long do you think humans have been cutting off other humans testicles

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:45.960
nice to forsake abandon

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:52.980
or leave in the Lurch when that kid that was assigned to Jesus because that's

00:20:52.980 --> 00:21:00.000
what the Greece says it says like a slave right when you when you give someone over as a slave that's what it

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.120
says about that naked boy he was that to Jesus right so anywho he's got this

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.220
bandage on his private parts all right this is right before Jesus is

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:17.520
yelling I'm not a lace this right you have to please people understand Jesus

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:24.179
Christ is standing in a public park at 4 00 am

00:21:24.179 --> 00:21:30.960
with a naked boy raising his hands saying I'm not

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:38.280
elastase oh you know they are concerned with robbers

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:49.260
that's a cleft face this is a lace days so Jesus is in a criminal organization

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:55.919
one would thank if he is screaming out I'm not one of them

00:21:55.919 --> 00:22:02.120
okay either that either that there's only one other explanation

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.900
it looks like he's a lay Stace

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:17.100
the cops who are the Roman soldiers are going to pin it on something right when

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:24.440
you are sitting there under lockdown in a jail

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:31.140
you are there in the Roman system under a charge

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:36.960
fantastic the guy that they let out to Pardon to

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:42.000
so Jesus can get crucified the crowd because at this point the crowd he's

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.340
just been arrested at public park with a naked kid and he's yelling out I'm not a

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:55.580
child trafficker I'm not a child trafficker right I'm not a child trafficker

00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:01.919
and now the crowd is yelling out we have the Greek here but the crowd is yelling

00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:09.240
out now don't give us some other person we want

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:16.080
him we want him to get crucified there was a vehemence in the crowd now

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:22.140
the Christians will tell you it's because the devil was there whipping up everybody

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:28.320
but we don't have you know we don't have the time or the extra

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:35.640
dimensional resources to go into the physics we just want to see the history we just

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:42.000
want to open up that little bit of History so we can see it I'm let's press on press on I'm going to give you some

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.159
fun exciting stuff thank you for spinning your Friday or evening with me

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:55.380
by the way it's generous of everybody yeah yeah so at this time you know Jesus said to The Crowd Oh you come after me

00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:01.080
right now it wrote this one this is Matthew or John okay Matthew okay

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:06.900
um I this one's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kind of funny it strikes me as funny because he's

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:13.280
actually talking to an awklos right which is like an unruly mob

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:20.280
unruly mob right um but this unruly mob is just imagine

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:25.500
it's not like people from all walks of society it's full of Roman soldiers

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:34.400
officers of the temple and elders right yeah okay okay

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:40.279
it's a raid it's a raid

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:47.100
Jesus and he gets thrown in and crucified between

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:52.260
two child traffickers isn't that funny

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:57.440
these aren't robbers these aren't robbers

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:03.059
well these aren't robbers at all wow

00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:10.380
right so now that naked kid seems really relevant to the whole

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:19.919
equation let's bring up another one that was another one yeah now this one I think is Luke 22

00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:25.679
yeah yeah and Jesus said yeah to those who were gathered out you know the arch

00:25:25.679 --> 00:25:32.159
priests and the soldiers and and the old and the you know elders and

00:25:32.159 --> 00:25:40.919
um he says you came out you came out you come out like you're all ready to take down a pirate

00:25:40.919 --> 00:25:46.080
yeah they were they were they had all the weapons if

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:53.100
they had chess camps that's what you see how different world history would be if we had a chess cam of the officers who

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:59.159
arrested Jesus in a public park with a naked kid while he was screaming I am

00:25:59.159 --> 00:26:06.059
not a child trafficker if we had that scene guaranteed none of this none of

00:26:06.059 --> 00:26:11.520
this would have done what it did right the accurate

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:18.240
transmission of evidence that's what we're looking for right out of his mouth let's pull it

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:25.500
out give us another bit of the Bible excellent we're going to the good stuff oh look at

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:31.320
this one I like this one yeah here's here's just to show you just

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:38.940
plain and stay the word on the left clap days that's your word for thief

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:44.779
the word on the right lay Stace right that's the word this is from John

00:26:44.779 --> 00:26:50.940
that's the special word yes now Christians again

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:56.220
I know your instinct is to say no he

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:03.000
meant Thief he meant insurrectionist human thief or insurrectionist

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.700
yeah okay

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.799
he should have used the word Thief he didn't Jesus was not crucified

00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:17.940
between two Banditos

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:26.760
it wasn't he was crucified with some people who were selling children

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:34.080
yeah and if you'll notice Barabbas when they said let Barabbas out

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:41.820
it said he was incarcerated he was in chained with them

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:51.179
not as one of them but with them it's very likely that this dude was actually

00:27:51.179 --> 00:27:55.940
not with the gang

00:27:57.419 --> 00:28:02.880
anywho he was preferable to Jesus who they had just caught they had just caught right

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:12.299
people don't realize it but there were other jesuses in jail when Jesus was arrested

00:28:12.299 --> 00:28:17.400
he was not the only person arrested for what he was arrested for

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:26.760
yeah he was placed among the Pirates for your sins evangelicals he was placed

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:32.700
between the Pirates and that little naked boy runs off in

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:40.640
history having left behind his bandage that was covering his genitalia

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:46.500
he ran away and you and I

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:52.340
live in a world that worships him

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:59.520
yeah yeah amazing Amazing Grace

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:08.460
now for people who want to say he doesn't have texts that's all I'm

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:15.179
giving you please realize it's all I'm showing you the text right it's not me I didn't want to make

00:29:15.179 --> 00:29:21.779
this system with Jesus I didn't want him to be this way I wasn't there when the dude got

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:27.919
arrested right to me this is a Cold Case

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:38.779
yeah but what I do love is bringing you all

00:29:38.779 --> 00:29:45.120
that real dirt that real dirt it's gorgeous give me another quote let's do

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:51.179
just a couple more people need to get on with their evenings maybe watch a nice movie or something

00:29:51.179 --> 00:29:56.659
yes um so look at what the crowd's doing they're they're shouting out right don't

00:29:56.659 --> 00:30:02.580
right don't we don't want Barabbas right right

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:08.899
the one that's the lay States interesting

00:30:08.899 --> 00:30:13.919
interesting poor barberabbas don't you feel bad for him because it's like he's

00:30:13.919 --> 00:30:19.020
there with them right he did something wrong I don't know what it was maybe it's just in the

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:24.720
wrong place at the wrong time maybe it was just a bad deal gone down you know

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:30.059
how it is things happen people end up chained up

00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:37.260
with a bunch of pirates it's just the way it is yeah fantastic you thought he was in a

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:42.539
ship didn't you no no right not yet that's what they do with the

00:30:42.539 --> 00:30:48.779
kids this eunuch that Jesus was with right this boy that he was you know

00:30:48.779 --> 00:30:55.260
obviously he didn't want to be there anyway right because he was like I don't want to do this right take this cop away

00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:00.360
but my will but yours boom he's all like I'm thirsty

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:07.380
um he's rocking man he's on the poison he's on the juice let's look at some of the drugs here involved keep going

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.600
yeah this next one yeah yeah so this is just Barabbas this is

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:18.679
Barabbas with those those factions right criminal

00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:24.059
organizations those those well I wouldn't say Mafia

00:31:24.059 --> 00:31:32.520
because it's not like families the Romans have what's like mafias um don't be surprised but they do

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:38.760
um it's just back to history right powerful families rising up and controlling the finances of the

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:45.240
neighborhoods that's all that's all yeah they tried that in Athens

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:52.460
yeah didn't work power of the demon part of the neighborhood thinks so long

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:57.600
yeah you see what we lost we need this now more than ever

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:03.480
we need it love it grow the next text I want to give them I want to give them

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:11.880
good stuff I know there's plenty there's plenty of good stuff in here oh God yes yes yes and Jesus came into the

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:19.380
temple oh look this is part piracy that you may not have considered now I said this in the in the introduction

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:25.200
uh-huh I said this in the introduction this is Matthew by the way yeah um I

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.419
said this in the introduction that there were traffickers in the temple

00:32:30.419 --> 00:32:36.059
traffickers in the temple yeah yeah it wasn't the Thieves Guild

00:32:36.059 --> 00:32:41.580
for those of you evangelicals who want to make the fairy tale it was not the

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:51.840
Thieves Guild and it was not insurrectionists yeah the Your Glory Days history of the

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:57.960
smells of the crack of Josephus and Philo no

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:04.200
no I'm sorry it doesn't things have to meet a standard you know their standards

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.899
it's a museum it's a museum standards

00:33:09.899 --> 00:33:17.419
right okay so let's go back to the text here we are here it comes something

00:33:17.419 --> 00:33:23.220
boldly insulting please um yeah and he came into the temple yeah

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:29.279
and he threw out all of those who were who were doing what look at poluntas do

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:35.159
you remember what the Thracians same verb that it was using there now it

00:33:35.159 --> 00:33:41.159
can be just be selling of anything yeah it doesn't have to be children right the verb doesn't have to be

00:33:41.159 --> 00:33:47.580
children okay but he kicks out the sellers uh-oh and the agorad zontas the

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:54.720
agorads yeah those participating in the market

00:33:54.720 --> 00:34:00.240
what are they gonna give what are they gonna what do they want here really before he kicks over those tables and

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:05.399
all that kind of stuff let's see the birds flying why because we buy doves

00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:11.040
for Aphrodite there's a reason that Mary the mother of Christ

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:19.200
had a burning purple ooze in her vagina there's a reason it's medical it's

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:26.280
called it's mystery where you're getting all these terms Christ you think Christ you think Jesus

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:32.638
walked onto the scene and he was the Christ you think that title didn't come

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:38.099
from a thousand years of History my goodness people

00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:45.980

young boys don't be surprised

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.859
yeah there's a reason there's a reason

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:53.400
yeah that group that he was with Barabbas yeah they were involved in a murder

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:59.540
which you know these criminal organizations always are

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:07.500
what is funding all of this Lasik activity pirate activity what is

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:14.480
funding it is the drug money thank you are you surprised

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:21.240
that's why we pardon Mary Magdalene for her what for what I heard one of you

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:32.119
say it for what for owning and or possessing sex drugs

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:41.040
what was the date what was the date on that prehistoric

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:49.079
dildo 36 000 I think it was thirty six thousand yeah something like that

00:42:49.079 --> 00:42:54.599
um these devices go way back polished Stone

00:42:54.599 --> 00:43:03.960
um everywhere you go with one of these Pirates there's going to be an association with an erection

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:09.180
think of it as universal grooming

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:14.819
yeah anywho look the trade is going on

00:43:14.819 --> 00:43:21.359
in Antiquity and it will continue to go on by Jesus it has been going on for a

00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:26.760
long time yeah and the Romans will keep trying to bat

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:33.060
it down right because Romans don't abide Pirates

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:40.380
these are not insurrectionists these are organized crime families for lack of a

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:47.400
better word families no you know it's it's it's the the local

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:53.579
um power Brokers who are getting all the money from the drug trade oh

00:43:53.579 --> 00:43:59.720
you know how expensive the purple is remember Mary's got that in her vagina

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:05.579
when her midwife gives her the exam

00:44:05.579 --> 00:44:11.400
that is in the Coptic

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:16.880
yeah in the Coptic love it

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:24.780
okay okay last couple of sources yeah yeah I I ended us here with a good yeah

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:29.880
go ahead look this is just a couple lines in the Candor um look at these two dirty lines right

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:36.060
here this is dirty nikander and I gotta tell you I just want to paint this image for you and I want to thank you so much

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:41.400
for spending all this time and I want to say

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:46.859
this is dirtiness I just brought it look I just brought it

00:44:46.859 --> 00:44:52.020
because I knew you would appreciate ancient dirtiness this is straight up

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:57.240
history you can't get history like this elsewhere this is the history of the of

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:02.700
the dirty yeah and it comes from that priest that

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:08.300
Pagan priest of Apollo you mean he's an oracular priest yeah

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:16.260
he's one of these who operates the Mysteries now when someone tells you today if they walk up to you today and

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:23.000
they say to you oh I am an initiator of initiates

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:30.060
yeah say you're not a Mr GOG yeah

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:36.420
I've got a Mr Gog for you and that's what's coming through

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:43.680
and I need to get you to a place that you can see a priestess drugging

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:49.700
a person putting them into a death state

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:56.460
bringing them to climax Reviving them

00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:01.740
and then chasing them around beating him

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:09.599
as pigs yeah that's the cult that's the mystery

00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:16.740
that's where we go back to this game is not just convincing you in a church

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:24.300
you've sat in churches you've sat in synagogues right you sat in your mosque or knelt

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:30.720
you know you've heard the call yeah none of that

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:36.119
none of that has the element

00:46:36.119 --> 00:46:43.020
of the pharmacists from the Pagan Magic right there's no magic in faith

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:50.040
no magic whatsoever you took Jesus a Marcus with a an orphic

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:57.300
title Christ and you neutered him you neutered him

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:04.619
you made him neither a Son of God nor a daughter he made him neither

00:47:04.619 --> 00:47:09.780
because she took away his magic dude I'm sorry I know you don't like the

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:16.200

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:29.400

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:35.280

the poison in the bow that they're all using

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:53.760
is a poison that they have incorporated into rights

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:59.460
to bring you to a state of being born again

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:04.500
and in order to receive that you have to drink her blood

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:11.420
right her blood with the essence

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:18.000
energizing it it's a Pneumatic power that she transfers and in that power you

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:24.240
could imagine it the the [Music] application of the drug induces

your Islam that right was created by the woman

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:40.400
by a single woman a mind in history

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.700

you know it's a purification it's a purification

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:42.599
remember the Thracians they don't care if they're daughters have intercourse

00:52:42.599 --> 00:52:46.099
that's their business

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:55.140
and who would anyway a lot of those tribes the those daughters they have to kill three men before they can get

00:52:55.140 --> 00:53:02.000
married yeah and by marriage I just mean you know making your making your man do his

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:09.390
nourishing stuff and then kicking him out if you don't like him yeah oh if it's a boy by the way adoption

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:15.180
[Laughter] imagine that ladies who has who has of

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:22.680
all you women here for all you women anybody who has the spirit of Aphrodite in them that Spirit

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:28.559
of Hera yeah which you know if you could do this I

00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:33.920
mean how much do you really need that man seriously

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:39.000
how much in that Society how much not much

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.339
yeah you gotta kill three

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:49.680
I can't imagine killing one it makes us look rather weak doesn't it

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:56.819
it does imagine this woman right perhaps the poet was right

00:53:56.819 --> 00:54:02.940
Mars Needs women angry red women

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:08.640
yeah so you can see the cult and where the lace face is coming from by the way

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:13.859
these these Amazonian or scythian tribes the women

00:54:13.859 --> 00:54:19.200
um would abducts men right in groups they're always working in groups

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:26.220
right you see the criminal conspiracies have to congeal around groups and if

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:34.319
they become cultural where you just have um Pirates right who answer to no laws

00:54:34.319 --> 00:54:43.200
but the laws of one very strong central in the bronze ages women

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:49.819
yeah yeah kick ass

00:54:49.819 --> 00:54:56.339
brilliant women who finally figured out this is what I told the Watchers have

00:54:56.339 --> 00:55:04.020
finally figured out you don't need a man [Laughter] how long how long did it take for some

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:09.300
group to say you know what we could do better if we

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:15.300
called these males right and we just propagate a line in a

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:23.339
very intelligent Advanced ruling women and people in the 20th century turned

00:55:23.339 --> 00:55:31.940
that incredible historical reality into a friggin comic book

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:40.380
yeah you anthropologists out there you need to you need to go visit those

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:45.900

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:51.420
is the Athena has this child of Earth why the Virgin

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:56.880
