00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:57.560

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:17.240
let's do this let's do this here's what I've got tonight I want to show you um a

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.800
few slides but before I do before you hit the hyperdrive chewy um I just want

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.880
people to know that I've got um several

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:34.040
classes that I'm gonna go ahead and offer I'm going to use this opportunity because Danny asked me in the interview

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:39.160
he's like what do you what did you do after um

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:45.959
university after they um drove you out of

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:53.240
town yeah um what does one do at that point well now I have a chance to do

00:13:53.240 --> 00:14:01.000
something yes yes right now I have a chance to bring back that

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.600
University um only ours is going to be better yeah definitely definitely can

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:15.480
you hear the thunderous Applause of people I've got some classes to offer you and I consider taking them um of

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:21.480
course we'll have the Intensive Greek 20 this one will be a strict 20we course

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:28.480
right you go at um your pace but you have to make the benchmarks in order to pass it right you got to be up there and

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.800
if you can't you can't right you just got to work um and I'll have Labs there

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:40.040
and I'll be mean to you right but in a good way in a good way not in a not in a

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:46.680
derogatory kind of way but in a way to get you pumped up because one of the things I talked with Dan Danny about was

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:53.279
this language makes you smarter okay it makes you smarter and

00:14:53.279 --> 00:15:00.920
people will comment to me and they have for years ever since I've been teaching it people come to a point they realize

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:07.680
oh my God I'm outthinking other people around me right my husband's a lot dumber

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:14.759
than than I thought yeah it's because the Greek does

00:15:14.759 --> 00:15:21.360
something to your mind it causes you to expand it causes you to reach out and to

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:29.680
stretch in directions that you're not used to stretching with your foul anglosaxon mouths

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:35.160
that language that you have it's so barbaric

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.440
English so barbaric doesn't matter what dialect

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:47.240
it's barbaric and half of its base is

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:53.160
greatek okay so right what we have to do

00:15:53.160 --> 00:16:00.079
is we have to expose ourselves those of us who have the call to that bapt ISM

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:07.880
That Dying of the Greek and when you're wearing the purple yeah you're ready to fly you're

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:13.360
ready to go yeah mind expanding can you believe

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:19.639
that it's mind expanding but it's sweating this isn't just a pill that

00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:29.319
you're G to take and you're going to go to La La Land that's what those religious historians are for

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:37.120
yeah yeah I'm sorry but um we have to point out those who are deficient you

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:45.880
know come on man they're Samurai right you guys know that I'm roning that's what my publisher told me

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:51.680
she said um she's from Ronin press and she said you're

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:58.920
Ronin and um that's nice that's a compliment because the Ronin um were B

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:06.319
basically outcasts their lord had been overthrown their Dao had been overthrown they had nowhere to go they could just

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:13.558
live a life um in a as a samurai write poetry

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:19.038
right do what's right that kind of thing um but they got no protection from a

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:24.360
lord they're not part of the structure they're on the outside man it's not life

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.600
is not the same when you're in Exile yeah right because they're

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:37.160
dangerous once your Lord's been lost you're a you're a dangerous element yeah fantastic do you see where

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.559
we are that's where we are so I was able to talk with Danny about some of that

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:48.919
kind of stuff and you can hear Stephen eating his popcorn in the

00:17:48.919 --> 00:17:54.320
background okay give him a hard time for that it's it it's a perfect effect I

00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:00.679
mean it's a perfect effect um was gorgeous these these guys are geniuses

00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:08.840
absolute Geniuses I loved it I want to go back okay let's um yeah so what are the

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:16.039
courses that I can offer you let's just slow down and let me give you the courses so intensive Greek I'm gonna

00:18:16.039 --> 00:18:23.280
have a basic Greek lit and a basic Roman lit I'm gonna go ahead and throw in a

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.600
little bit of you know I'm thinking about cutting out that side completely to be quite honest cuz I don't think we

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:34.720
have time yeah I don't think we have time we need Greek we need Greek that's the one

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:42.400
that we really need so um we'll have a Greek literature course then um also a

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:49.640
myth course because I know people are they want I used to teach myth at the University right um

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:56.240
so um I I understand um we'll have an English word roots

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:03.400
course yeah yeah but I think um that one I'm going to incorporate with the

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:09.679

fantastic love it love it good stuff good stuff um let's go to the sources

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:58.520
and see what we've got now this is the kind of thing that I'm going to pull out in the classes and I want people to be a

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:03.600
able to follow even if you don't have any interest in the Greek I want you

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.640
just to follow it hit me with the passage remember people this is the

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:17.840
famous passage mark 14:51 from the New Testament Kai

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:24.960
Nanos T and this T here it never gets translated it never gets

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:32.600
translated right it's an indefinite so so it's some something or

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:40.679
someone and what is the sum of it it's suos that second word that is not only a

00:23:40.679 --> 00:23:48.080
diminutive on the end of it it's root is boy so this is young boy young boy

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:58.919
there's a some young guy Jesus is with some young guy

00:24:00.679 --> 00:24:08.320
and what is that what is some young guy what is what is what is the fourth word

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:16.480
in he's assigned to him as a as a what well like a slave or

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.679
a soldier and this guy's not he doesn't have any armor

00:24:21.679 --> 00:24:27.039
on so wait a minute you mean Jesus Christ wasn't just out doing

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:34.880
carpentry no he was important enough to have

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.640
assigned underage naked

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:49.480
slaves did Jesus have money it's funny he always appears

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:56.279
poor I think your picture is wrong because here he's got enough power that

00:24:56.279 --> 00:25:02.880
he's assigned his own naked boy slave and there's there's you know um we can

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:08.360
go into length about um what that

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:15.120
privilege is when you've got to have that you know when you've got that money like Jesus isn't doing this in the

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:21.760
palace right he's not watching he's not watching his wife's daughter his

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:29.039
stepdaughter he's not watching her dance naked um in a dark

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:35.120
back alley somewhere right he's not watching that

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:41.200
he's in the palace and all the big wigs are there this is entertainment

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:47.919
bro and she comes out and dances so good he says I'll give you anything no this

00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:54.200

generals slaves yeah attend what does slaves do

00:28:39.039 --> 00:28:45.720
they attend on you now why would I need a young naked boy to attend on me and

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:54.720
feel that I had to hide it in a public park at 400 a.m. because I'm not running with Herod

00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:00.840
when I'm doing it right he can do that kind of stuff you can't bro and the

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:07.000
rich always do that's not a conspiracy I'm telling you

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.919
historically that's a fact I'm sorry people goes right back to it over and

00:29:12.919 --> 00:29:18.640
over and over again yeah yeah interesting let's go hit

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:23.720
the next one look at this I was just going to show you the scene down we've all seen this here let's go through

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:31.679
these quick Trey because this is the scene D the bandage this is wait this is Boos right look at the first line booos

00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:37.159
down right oh nice right Bo

00:29:37.159 --> 00:29:45.320
onon oh no no um what is it the linen band is used

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:50.760
for momies and then wounds right there's not much else

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:56.399
you're going to wrap with this stuff but everybody look at number two and remember that it is

00:29:56.399 --> 00:30:02.159
poros right or porur in the herculanum library when we

00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:09.799
bring that up we're going to see what is the purple what is the purple remember they're applying this via linen

00:30:09.799 --> 00:30:17.159
wraps via linen wraps do you mean they're putting the burning purple on a

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:24.159
linen wrap and then wrapping up a young kid's private parts with it yes what are

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:30.919
you gonna do at that point if you're Jesus somehow the goop is going to get

00:30:30.919 --> 00:30:36.159
on your face right why is that for the

00:30:36.159 --> 00:30:43.640
galain for the Galan you're gonna suck the Black Death right through that

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:49.120
linen yeah it's impregnated in the

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:55.039
wrap okay are you seeing it are you seeing what Jesus is doing are you

00:30:55.039 --> 00:31:01.399
seeing that's one of the things that I like that Danny said was he said all oh my God all of a sudden this stuff is

00:31:01.399 --> 00:31:07.880
making sense yeah yeah I'm sorry to inform you

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:15.039
that your God is a child killer and his son is a

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:22.600
pedophile yeah pederast is the technical term in Antiquity for those who have the

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:28.639
students just like Hercules and his pederastic k

00:31:28.639 --> 00:31:36.200
his Centaur yeah are you there do you see where you

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:41.720
are this is your life this is your

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:47.639
life and you serve a

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:53.159
past if you're into that kind of thing maybe throw in some

00:31:53.159 --> 00:32:00.159
genocide yeah that's usually what happens but that stuff has to be purged

00:32:00.159 --> 00:32:05.600
that stuff has to be purged and that's coming from the one that you don't see

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.880
except in the reflection yeah you know who she is you

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:16.720
know who she is all right let's go to the next next text next text who's

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:23.399
saying that is it's the sacred name do you not know the sacred name what is

00:32:23.399 --> 00:32:28.679
this what is this purple um just look down at number two um this is that has

00:32:28.679 --> 00:32:34.919
to do with the cloth I want you to see that all the way under Roman numeral number two number four they finally give

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:41.120
you the concrete form of it right they tell you purple color this is the purple

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:46.519
this is the purple it's not like they go to school and learn about the

00:32:46.519 --> 00:32:54.279
colors right everybody knows what the purple is and it has um symbolic

00:32:54.279 --> 00:33:02.440
associations with it to the extreme right to the extreme it is Royal it is

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:08.760
Royal it is divine yeah it is that death and if you

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:14.639
don't have that galain if you're not sucking that black death right out of

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:23.760
that linen your mouth isn't full of the burning purple um yeah you you're not in right

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:29.600
that's how you disrupt the signal yeah it's how you you breach

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:37.200
through that dark star yeah fantastic oh God it's delicious isn't it let's go to

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:43.360
uh the purple was there and then I wanted you to see the Morant too but that's okay um it's a part of the

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:51.799
preparation finally Baff right Baff dipping what is the dipping the baptism is a dying and that

00:33:51.799 --> 00:33:57.960
dying is a drug action and a lot of you will say well

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:03.519
that's obvious isn't it right yeah not necessarily right not drugs in the way

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:12.839
that you think of them yeah the dying of the hair was talked about talked

00:34:12.839 --> 00:34:19.158
about as the invention of media whose brain must have

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:24.720
been huge she must have had connections she must have okay it wasn't I'm sure

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:32.560
her brain wasn't huge but but um her calculating power must have been off the

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:38.919
charts because she apparently invented that we have ancient sources that tell us she invented hair

00:34:38.919 --> 00:34:44.158
dyes which is cool if you think about they say her native color was blonde but

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:49.560
she'd dye her hair all the time yeah you know there's a fashion an

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:56.560
Antiquity of having a purple stripe having a purple stripe you know

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:03.040
what you honor you know what you honor to the you offer to the dead you give them the honor of

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:10.119
your purple stripe isn't that a gorgeous isn't that a gorgeous concept imagine the women

00:35:10.119 --> 00:35:19.040
that were doing this imagine them you can yeah imagine them oh the purple

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:25.520
stripe yeah we're there people we're um this right up that Alleyway this is

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:31.280
gorgeous I love this okay um thank you for the great pictures by the way chewy

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:38.320
chewy didn't go with me this time next time chewy will go with me I'm definitely I need my own chewy you know

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:44.200
what I mean and so leaving behind the bandage the kid ran away naked good now

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:50.800
all I want to point out because you guys have seen this thousand times all I want to point out is look all we're doing is

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:57.280
going to the Greek that's all we're doing we're just going back to the Greek and the only way

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:03.720
for us to really get down to the dirt is to read a whole bunch is to read a whole

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:09.280
bunch that's that's the only way it's the only way kid fled naked let's go to the next one we're going to fly through

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:14.520
these because I've already taken people's time um here's the new NIV

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:22.560
let's let's kick it up let's beat this thing up he fled naked no that's not what it said no no said

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:28.920
first the bandage fell off his you know who

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:37.599
yeah that belongs yeah because why because why because he and Jesus who

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:45.160
by the way by this time Jesus is groggy and paranoid he's falling

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.599
over says mark and um paranoid

00:36:50.599 --> 00:36:57.880
scared yeah he's the guy is messed up he's jacked right so he's got to take

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:05.119
from that boy why do you think he's sitting there isn't it a gorgeous intimate picture of

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:11.240
Jesus that when Jesus Christ is arrested in a public park with a naked boy that

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:18.680
he has a difficulty taking the cup through that bandage he has a difficulty

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:24.760
doing that he's like oh Father oh dad remember dad's a child sacrificer so it

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:31.680
doesn't matter right Jesus got no sympathy on that end so it's like oh oh and by the way for

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:37.560
those of you who think and I get this every once in a while this image of your

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:44.160
piety your Christian piety we must spank the bottom of Christian

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:50.240
piety that's what you get and go hang with your sisters when

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.520
you because piety P never mind

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:01.480
um when you give in to the fairy tale you give you end up

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:06.839
giving over everything and Jesus didn't have a good relationship with his father

00:38:06.839 --> 00:38:15.680
his father killed him his father killed him um your model of what a father

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:23.319

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:47.440
let's run to the run to the real Zeus here and see what it is by the way Zeus

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:54.599
is thousands of years older than Yahoo so you can see that yaho is a corruption

00:38:54.599 --> 00:39:02.160
it's a corruption right of the generation of Heaven and Earth you didn't right in the beginning

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:09.400
was right go they all know this next one look at this get up he says Jesus is

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:16.720
like um this is when he gets discovered right and I want you to see Aus the a oh

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:23.359

00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:30.040
ground right see um they can't even stay awake he's having a problem he has to wake him up he he spends an hour with

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:37.119
the kid and then he goes back um or a watch which can be an uh two hours two

00:39:37.119 --> 00:39:43.119
and a half hours yeah so depending on who was doing it at what time what

00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:49.400
freaking Century um so it could be as long as two and a half hours so he's

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:55.280
there um with the kid for a considerable amount of time comes back and his guards you know

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:00.560
they're asleep again right can't keep these kids awake right give them the

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:06.960
stimulant right somebody give these kids a stimulant um that's what the L stas is

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:13.440
up to right so okay so there we are kid runs away good let's go to the next one

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:19.200
let's go to the next one um I just wanted to show you this is he's dude he's in a rush he says look betrayer is

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.920
gonna come over and hit it he's got a name for him already the

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:33.040
betrayer Jesus is good like Trump he makes up names yeah isn't that funny oh that's

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:41.880
funny um at this time Jesus answered and he said oh God I'm so ex homic with

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:47.400
you right now look at that second word on the I mean that first word on the

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:54.200
second line ex homic right

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:59.760
ex I'm being literally

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:06.599
intensively on the same Reckoning or reasoning as

00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:14.599
you now most of your translations be like oh Father I praise

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:24.440
you no he doesn't say that he doesn't say that at all he says we're on the same reason

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:32.920
wave you and me were on the same M reason father Lord this isn't just this

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:41.240
word cuos goes back to this is old Myan stuff right the Cora and the cuos all

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:47.880
that oracular stuff this Lord goes back to that so this is important I mean this

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:55.040
is thousand years before Jesus this thing is coming out right and he says what is he the Lord of he's the Lord of

00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:00.720
uranos and Gia wait a minute what you mean there's a

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:06.440
theogony in this thing yes there is and this is the

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:15.920
family right welcome welcome here it is it's from the Bible nobody reads the Bible anymore yeah and um he's hidden

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:22.920
right you hid this stuff which is what you know Christians if you don't realize all stuff is hidden think about it for a

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:30.680
minute there's no cult religion um starts out with drugs and baby blood and

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:37.559
brains remember the brains that was interesting um that has uh you know any

00:42:37.559 --> 00:42:43.720
sort of Hope um of of

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:49.160
becoming modern like what you've got today Christians um they don't have a

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:55.520
hope of becoming modern unless they un inject the system they take out the

00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:02.880
antidote so the step can't mix and we get boom we get explosion right that's what's going on

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:09.520
here um they're trying with the translations are trying to hold that down okay go back to the go back to the

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:16.800
because that's what you don't have that modern Christianity right it doesn't S it doesn't make any sense to you if you

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:22.559
have not um had the truth hidden from you in

00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:29.200
code right if you haven't been through that experience it's because you don't

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:36.599
crack it right crack it and then you'll know this is what it says it says you hid

00:43:36.599 --> 00:43:46.559
these things from the smarty pants yeah and you what you showed it out

00:43:46.559 --> 00:43:53.319
nap you showed it to the napio who are the nap you

00:43:53.319 --> 00:43:59.680
idiots they're children they're idiots children do you know what an idiot child

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:07.079
is it's a cool concept think about it for a minute everybody thinks oh we have child our Anglo Saxon doesn't permit us

00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:13.640
to take that extra step and say well you got different kinds of children right what kinds of children you know what the

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:21.839
Greek language allows you to do it allows you to classify Aristotle uses it that way

00:44:21.839 --> 00:44:28.640
right all the maestros of ancient Greek safo for

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:33.720
example that's exactly how she uses it she

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:41.240
categorizes yeah yeah what kind what kind of things can you have in the world

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:47.640
you can have something called an idiot child you know you can't blame an idiot

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:53.599
child idiot children just are they're idiot children you know what I mean it's

00:44:53.599 --> 00:44:58.119
not every child that's an idiot

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:07.200
yeah yeah okay so you kept this from the

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:13.160
wise and you gave it to idiots keep going if you're not an idiot you don't

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:18.449
know what I'm talking about just never [Music]

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:24.079
mind here we go at that time Jesus said I praise you father Lord of Heaven and

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:31.640
Earth because you have hidden these things from the w and learn and revealed them to who to little

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:41.680
children no it's not what it says says napio right not pyo right oh my God

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:48.359
nothing with with the kid there it's just a bad translation but what they're trying to do is they're trying to keep

00:45:48.359 --> 00:45:53.599
it um they're trying to keep it within the

00:45:53.599 --> 00:45:58.760

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:47.440
there are different types of kiss and you can categorize them there's the kiss that is um you meeting somebody for the

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:56.240
first time if you are in Italy yes or sing your friend home for lunch you know

00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:02.359
give him a peack on the cheek there's that kind of kiss and then there's this kind of kiss and this is the Amorous

00:48:02.359 --> 00:48:07.640
kiss this is the Amorous kiss this is the intensified kiss you know what I'm

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:13.119
talking about you don't kiss your mother like you do your girlfriend or your

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:19.440
boyfriend it's a different kind of Kiss well Jesus gives them the wet one right

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:25.119
he gives him the big one he's he tongues Judas now watch this watch his response

00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:31.119
notice the Greek what we're doing with right what I'm trying to introduce us to tonight is that

00:48:31.119 --> 00:48:36.839
refining refining in order to get you to see look you can make bigger words than you are

00:48:36.839 --> 00:48:42.079
actually in your brain your brain can do that it can come up with bigger

00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:50.119
Concepts um love it do the yep next one going want J yeah and he kissed him

00:48:50.119 --> 00:48:56.920
look they cleaned it up that's that's fto brothers that's not oh my dirty

00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:03.000
dirty deceitful men of the

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.520
cloth oh by the way take it down for a second I got to talk about some of my background that I didn't get to talk

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:17.119
about before which I thought was very nice I thought it was very nice yeah

00:49:17.119 --> 00:49:23.880
um some of it striking and scary which is

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:31.000
punctuated in the video by lightning and thunder th right you can hear the thunder in the background so when we

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:38.240
talk about which I thought was great effect um when we talk about the things that we

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:44.040
talk about which your yeah we're getting there let's do it bring me back the

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:50.280
source yeah go give me that one um here it is yeah it can also mean to caress to

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:57.640
it's basically to give intimate love to give that intense right that Kata is an

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:03.400
intensifier now you'll know because in the future when we put a Kata with something you'll know oh this thing

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:09.240
augments it this thing causes it to enter into the most of the most right if

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:15.520
this is a comparative right this is the one that's more than the other one right

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:22.720
love it look at the bottom this is the Amorous kiss we only have two more right we're almost done and Jesus did what he

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:30.319
said to him now watch you're never gonna get this unless you go to the Greek so Judas

00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:35.359
comes up and gives Jesus a giant mouth kiss right

00:50:35.359 --> 00:50:43.040
at Jesus is there with his dazed boys and the naked kid right you got to

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:49.040
imagine you got to set it up right he's already been stumbling around unsure on

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:56.280
his feet he doesn't want to do what he's going to do to get from that kid what he was trying to get and then all of a

00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:03.240
sudden he says oh my you know here they here comes

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:10.480
betrayer get up let's go he says let's go let's get out of here

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:15.720
right but it's too late we're in the middle of talking to him he Judas is already there on top of him French

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:22.960
kissing him yeah and then how do we know that it's french kissing

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:31.200
what's the next that same verse boom look at the one two 3 four five six word

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:37.839
inti right what does Jesus say to him Jesus says to him do what you gotta

00:51:37.839 --> 00:51:40.839
do

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:50.280
lover do what you got to do lover you

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:57.200
mean my universe of Salvation and Christianity

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:04.280
is based on that dude yes yes it

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:10.200
is yeah yeah so if you got no problem with

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:17.000
pederasty then worship away um if because and there may be some

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.200
people out there you know it's like you can't create a genocide without

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:28.799
weapons without some kind of plan without some kind of

00:52:28.799 --> 00:52:34.040
payments right you can't you need that as a backing if you cut that off you

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:39.880
can't have it anymore right your genocide will go away it has to be

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:47.640
supported there have to be resources poured into it right that's the way it is if you

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:53.680
want to shovel the fires of Yahoo that's the way you got to do it remember the

00:52:53.680 --> 00:53:01.040
divinities that father that is that good father that doesn't kill his kids are you ready this is from

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:08.160
vya the Priestess on the Vatican all of those

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:15.400
