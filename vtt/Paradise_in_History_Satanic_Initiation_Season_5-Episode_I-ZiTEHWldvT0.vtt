a good picture for this yeah um when we in when we're about to enter

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:13.759
into the Visionary State we start spasming in our

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:21.120
genitalia and in that area that's just between the two obstructions it's the

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:27.720
Paran you know right in that area we get spasming and he says from the tip from

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.000
the or um will drizzle out it that's what it

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.759

00:14:41.759 --> 00:14:46.959
flagma material that is has an appearance it's

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:52.120
clear like perspiration and it drizzles out during

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.680
the spasm me right out of the

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:04.839
organs now you think I've been talking about just just men right or just

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:11.360
somebody with an erection right um but the text DC tells

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:19.199
us right he tells us um women have the same

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:27.680
effects without the true sasis yeah yeah and then he gets a

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.920
little bit negative he gets into a negative mode we have to tell him stop

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:38.680
stop right let's see what's going on he says

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:44.959
okay what does it do to your brain doc what does it do to your

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:51.880
brain Aus it's frbl

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.959
optic I'm sorry that was a little bit V

00:15:56.959 --> 00:16:00.600
triloquist it's what

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:07.319
fapic it does what it breaks your

00:16:07.319 --> 00:16:14.040
mind isn't that nice fapic there's a word for this why is

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:22.079
this even important because this is the process that they're entering into within the mystery

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:28.360
operation they are losing it they are losing it you have to lose it to be born

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:34.440
again again right you have to lose it okay so where are we so far with the

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.440
saders we're talking about days we're talking about taking drugs that cause

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:46.240
you to be to have sataras right we're talking about an age

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:52.440
group that's primarily according to this doctor pubertal

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.480
boys yeah and that it's involved with initiations

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.079
initiations okay okay I think I'm I think I'm

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:08.678
beginning to see a picture that's emerging let's see if the good doctor

00:17:08.679 --> 00:17:17.360
has any has any um additional evidence um yeah yeah you know um they

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:23.079
can't they have some problems he said you know look when we put you through

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:29.640
this causes you to get what we call disordered speech so you're not going to

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:37.320
be able to communicate and it will bump up the

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:43.039
madness but what is he what did you say you're

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:49.559
dirty oh my goodness he says all that they can think of is um coming to

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:57.559
intercourse and they will just drop everything and all their clothing and

00:17:57.559 --> 00:18:04.840
they got this giant sarasus going on and they'll just chase

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.320
you down just they just cannot be

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:20.400
controlled why you see why would we ever need one of these well

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.480
remember as the physician will tell you this is associated with

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:32.480

Christ is a part of a long

00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:24.559
tradition of Rights and the corruption of those

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:29.679

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:21.920
fresh unread unstudied and neglected and uncared for

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:29.920
and abused texts that will give you the picture of antiquity I think it's emerging now I

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:36.200
think it's emerging and this makes us just that much closer to answering the

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:43.040
question of why we're all here the question is why was Jesus

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:48.359
arrested at 400 am with a naked boy what

00:40:48.359 --> 00:40:56.560
is that all about I've got more pirates for you this season lots of child trafficking for us

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:03.560
to consider lots more drug use lots more drug use when I saw him I got to tell
