00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:59.680
so uh early early

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.680
history of Judaism

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.759
the

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.919
religion not the

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:11.759
ethnicity the monest

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:14.240
religion right okay it's monism they're

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:17.000
at it again so those texts by the way

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.360
the fact that somebody said hey you know

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.360
this disproves you do you see what what

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.080
people do do you see what people do they

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:29.960
take that theological propaganda and

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:32.120
they destroy Society with it that's a LW

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:36.800
those texts are a

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:38.440
lie but historically they date to the

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:45.519
time

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:49.399
when a sect of monists is trying to

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:51.200
create trying to back

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:54.760
translate

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:57.680
Hebrew all right so that they can claim

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.240
it's theirs the text and the text we're

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.279

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.279

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.760
Greek text why because the Greeks were

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:17.760

directly into their eyes and it is such

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:15.079
a common practice that it is causing the

00:14:12.079 --> 00:14:15.079
prophets

00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:07.480
passage this passage

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:10.160
scientifically is a

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.240
breakthrough we are talking about a

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.320
description of

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:20.560
christing the addition of

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:22.639
Venom directly to the eyes and these are

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:26.320
not simples these are

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:29.639
compounds right love it where do I get

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:34.880

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:37.920
cost out of whose cpos out out of she

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.920

Pa right okay let's go on that's same

00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:57.680
same passage so he's what people is this

00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:00.480
is a doctor's verification of the

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.120
practice of putting the that Venom

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.560
directly into the eyes and they call it

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.319
christing there is

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:13.120
no Christian

00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:15.759
alive who can stand against

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:18.720
this and by the way the two texts that

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:20.839
I'm using perfectly surround the period

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.600
that the New Testament is written so

00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:27.560
it's before it already well established

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.639
the drink and the Christ and after it

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.839
what else is after it very well

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:34.079

no we have that eptic power in Greek

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.760
literature and that's why there's

00:26:58.039 --> 00:27:03.200
is is why

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.480
the Evangelical Community will not

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:11.679

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:22.159
they

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:25.360
know somebody owns the

00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:45.039

second word

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:08.520
Paro you're

something okay good whole bunch of whole

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:24.240
bunch of terms what is a

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:28.160
Parma well it's that which is glued on

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:32.400

on all right look at number two

00:36:40.359 --> 00:36:44.760
particularly right these are the ceria

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:48.000
these are the things that they're using

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:53.800
for the eyes why the eye haven't you

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:57.640
ever okay well it's a port of entry and

00:36:53.800 --> 00:37:00.400
it's a big deal in Mediterranean

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:02.839
medicine particularly in places like

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.640
Egypt and you get that in these medical

00:37:02.839 --> 00:37:08.920
authors where they talk about oh yeah

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:11.040
the oralia in Egypt is terrible right

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:17.240
and these are the drugs that we use and

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:17.240
what are the drugs doing yeah they're

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.119
christing you mean it's just the you're

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:26.319
just adding a drug to the eye yes just

00:37:24.119 --> 00:37:28.440
like it says right so all of these

00:37:26.319 --> 00:37:30.920
biblical experts let me just let me just

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.800
replay this in its Glory I'm sorry all

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.119
of these biblical experts came out and

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:39.560
said

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:43.560
Christ that is only used in medicine

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:45.800
everywhere else oop means something

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.560
else

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.720
yeah and in their

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:54.920
own

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.920
text Revelation

00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.960
three see

00:37:59.079 --> 00:38:02.480
what does he

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:06.160
say

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.160
18 what does he

00:38:07.319 --> 00:38:18.000
say Christ your eyes so that you may

00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:18.000
see Christ your eyes so that you may

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:25.160
see you mean amen you mean you have all

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:28.440
these texts that just talk about and

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:30.440
explain what was actually going on yes

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:35.240
and why did nobody get it up to this

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:36.839
point two reasons number one the

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:40.119
LIE

00:38:36.839 --> 00:38:42.480
of the Hebrew

00:38:40.119 --> 00:38:46.280
Torah that

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:52.160
permanently stake a claim that took the

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:55.800
Western mind and diverted it to a false

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:58.520
history yeah yeah that's why it always

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:01.240
has to be back projected

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.520
right that's why the Apologetics on that

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:05.560
side are

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:09.160
terrible on the side of those Semitic

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.160
languages it's

00:39:09.319 --> 00:39:14.119
terrible yeah you can't blame them

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.240
though because they don't have anything

00:39:14.119 --> 00:39:18.520
to work with in their science their

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:21.920
science has nothing to work

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:24.599
with right now the gentleman who's the

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.599
professor from Hebrew University who

00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:29.720
said in an article Hebrews ancient

00:39:26.599 --> 00:39:31.520
Hebrews got about ,000 unique words he

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:34.760
is helping to

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:37.359
construct the modern language of Hebrew

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.920
to push the standards forward so that

00:39:37.359 --> 00:39:44.079
the language

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:47.240
develops and it has but in Antiquity at

00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:49.440
the time that they're faking and forging

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:53.640
these texts and saying oh the original

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:57.400
is Hebrew right um these already well

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:59.920
established text what uh uh they do it

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:02.160
poorly it's a bad mons are always

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.560
terrible scientists they're always

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.560
terrible scientists and you have to be

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.720
with language and that's why nobody

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:11.040
wants to come to Alan because they know

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.680

a

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:27.880
past I've shown people that he was a

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:30.599
drug-using pederast who got not what he

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.640
deserved but strangely enough went

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:37.160
through a

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:37.160
right of death and resurrection and the

00:40:37.319 --> 00:40:44.960
process oh God it's

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:47.680

00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:29.720
are the christing

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:33.000
right and what are they going to you're

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.960

00:42:02.359 --> 00:42:07.160
first reason the second reason that we

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:10.440
don't have this is because nobody reads

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:14.040
the medical side why is that because

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.880
it's too technical baby I'd rather read

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:19.839

challenge they're dead from the

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:15.520

to happen if I flash these up in front

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:24.720
of somebody who's been through a

00:53:21.559 --> 00:53:28.440
seminary I could flash these up at the

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:31.880

program I could throw this up in front

00:53:47.319 --> 00:53:54.359
of Bach he would know what the hell's

00:53:49.599 --> 00:53:56.640
going on he wouldn't do you know why

00:53:54.359 --> 00:54:00.079
because they'd learn

00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:02.280
tiny tiny bit about one book imagine

00:54:00.079 --> 00:54:05.599
what would happen to your brain if all

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:09.400

one book all the

00:54:12.319 --> 00:54:18.880
time imagine what that would do to your

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:22.440
brain whoever translate that book can

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:24.280
guide you very easily and if they lack

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:27.920
in

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:30.200
skill if they're driven by Theology and

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.720
under the influence of the Ecstasy of

gender this person could be a woman but

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.960
strangely enough all the theologians

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:20.480
with all of their arrogance especially

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.720
the the two that stepped in the

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:26.440
Trap doct

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:30.039

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:37.039
coming the others are seeing it coming

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:41.480
now and they know there's no answer to

01:03:37.039 --> 01:03:44.480
this people it is the death Nowell of

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:47.279

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.480
not talking about gender because for

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:06.200
some reason these

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:09.359
theologians these biblical experts who

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:11.760

got going right now we will drill these

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:50.920

here's a two termination adjective right

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:18.639
it's masculine it's feminine are the

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:20.159
same so [ __ ] can be masculine or

01:18:18.639 --> 01:18:23.159
feminine

01:18:20.159 --> 01:18:27.520
remember your adjective is going to have

01:18:23.159 --> 01:18:31.239
to line up with that case number and

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:33.800
gender okay so that's all we're doing

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:37.040
we're forming the ending of that

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:40.760
adjective and the Mr Rogers word this

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:43.760

attention here's the summary of

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:37.480
conditional sentences summary of

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:40.280
conditional sentences right here's the

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:44.440
point of grammar that this chapter is

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:47.800
all about take it seriously now people

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:47.800
right take it

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:55.440

chewy it's not that funny okay you make

01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:00.840
a big deal about it

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:05.040
somebody okay look people what is a

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:07.440
conditional sentence it's an if then

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:10.679
right if something happens then

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:13.639
something else happens and there are

01:20:10.679 --> 01:20:18.320
many ways to use this Construction in

01:20:13.639 --> 01:20:21.520
Greek it is broken down here into six

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:26.639
forms the future more Vivid the future

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:29.719
less Vivid the present General the past

01:20:26.639 --> 01:20:31.760
General the present contrary to fact

01:20:29.719 --> 01:20:33.800
that sounds way too complicated the

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:36.400
present contrary fact and the past

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:39.800
contrary fact you hear how it's three

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:42.520
sets of twins right it's three sets of

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:47.159
twins I want you to look at the protesis

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:51.080
what is the pro what the H protesis

01:20:47.159 --> 01:20:54.280
what this word is coming from the Greek

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:57.440
garans defining their language did you

01:20:54.280 --> 01:21:01.280
know you live off the glory of this

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:05.480
language you live off the glory of this

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:09.239
language oh God it's it's a shameful

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:10.840
thing for us to have plotted through so

01:21:09.239 --> 01:21:13.840
many

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.840
bogs

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:20.840
hairry it's three sisters Three Twins a

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:23.080
future more Vivid and a future less

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:25.800
Vivid right they're twins then a present

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:28.400
General and a past general they're twins

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:30.760
then a present contrafactual and past

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:31.880
contrafactual each of these now what do

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.639
you do you need to know this

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:35.040
conceptually no because I know you're

01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:37.239
sitting there just like I did and I was

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:40.760
like oh I hope you didn't ask me to

01:21:37.239 --> 01:21:44.800
figure that out right no I just want you

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:47.199
to memorize there are six types here

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:49.880
they are learn their names future more

01:21:47.199 --> 01:21:52.880
Vivid has a pricy and an apois what the

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:57.920
hell is that the protesis is the if

01:21:52.880 --> 01:22:01.600
Clause the apois is the then Clause if

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:05.120
then that's all you what is the if

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:07.320
clause in a future more Vivid it is an

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:09.080
Aon plus a

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:12.280
subjunctive you're going to use a

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:14.000
subjunctive form of the verb for your if

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:15.880
Clause what about its hypothesis what

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.719
about it's then Clause it's going to

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:21.199
have a future indicative now how am I

01:22:18.719 --> 01:22:22.840
going to translate that I still haven't

01:22:21.199 --> 01:22:24.159
told you to think about this please

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:25.080
don't use your brain the more you use

01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:28.520
your brain

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:30.760
the worse you will be I know that sounds

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:35.800
completely off the

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:38.520
wall no you are in survival training you

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:42.320
are underwater and it is

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:47.040
freezing what do you do you don't

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:47.040
think if you have to think you

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:55.320
die don't think there are six types of

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:57.600
conditionals the first type

01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:01.480
has an Aon plus a subjunctive in its

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:04.040
protesis followed by a future indicative

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:07.679
in its apothesis and what is the

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:10.840
translation formula for that

01:23:07.679 --> 01:23:15.360
amen look at it it's in English and

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:18.760
italics underneath does will do if

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:21.639
somebody does then somebody will

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:25.080
do you cannot translate this sentence

01:23:21.639 --> 01:23:27.960
otherwise it'll throw you off

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:31.880
the tenses will throw you

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:35.920
off yeah those tenses are like the wild

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:39.480
estris that a young Philly gets the wild

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:39.480
estris that makes her want to

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:49.560
run that is what is in the tents and you

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:53.320
can't master that you have to just

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:55.600
memorize how it's done how it's done

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:57.400
okay blow it up to blow it up I want to

01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:00.040
give you one more kind so what that's a

01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:04.440
future more Vivid a does will do what is

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:08.159
a future less Vivid a plus the optative

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:11.000
in the protesis optative Plus on in the

01:24:08.159 --> 01:24:12.840
apothesis and what is the

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.880
translation

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:18.600
should

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:22.719
would if somebody should do

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:24.080
something then somebody would do

01:24:22.719 --> 01:24:27.760
something you see how you have to think

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:29.920
about it you don't have to think about

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:33.480
it

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:36.120
okay what is that present General it's

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.320
Aon plus a subjunctive followed by a

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:42.320
present and what is the translation

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:45.440
formula sir it's a does does if somebody

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:48.040
does then somebody else does what is a

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:50.520
past general it's an A plus an optative

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:53.080
followed by an imperfect

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:56.920
indicative and how is that one

01:24:53.080 --> 01:25:01.719
translated did did past

01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:04.080
general what is a

01:25:01.719 --> 01:25:09.000
contrafactual a present

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:12.639
contrafactual were would a past

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.239
contrafactual had would have do I use my

01:25:12.639 --> 01:25:21.080
brain at all when I do

01:25:15.239 --> 01:25:24.480
that nope if I had to we would be in

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:27.880
trouble because we are underwater and

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:31.520
it's freezing what do you

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:34.560
do you follow your training that stuff

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:37.400
has to become muscle memory this chart

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:40.400
should become muscle memory you should

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:42.040
wake up thinking about the differences

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:45.159
between those

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:47.800
contrafactual were would and had would

01:25:45.159 --> 01:25:50.800
have oh my God look at them what are

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:53.280
they were wood is a plus an imperfect

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:57.159
followed by an imperfect Plus on were

01:25:53.280 --> 01:26:00.840
wood t would have a plus an arist

01:25:57.159 --> 01:26:02.639
followed by an aist Plus on you see the

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:06.199
patterns you're going to see a lot of

01:26:02.639 --> 01:26:08.280
patterns here a lot of things line up

01:26:06.199 --> 01:26:10.840
because it's physics baby and when you

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:15.000
can get your language to do the dance of

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.000
physics you're GNA get

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:23.159
libraries you can't even build the

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:25.880
things without it don't tell me I know

01:26:23.159 --> 01:26:29.000
people you love your pyramids you know

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:31.679
who thinks that's funny the

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.560
Watchers you know what they like best

01:26:31.679 --> 01:26:34.560
they like those Big

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:40.040
Blocks they like those Big

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.520
Blocks oh God it's why any of them with

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.400
taste where do all the Watchers end up

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:46.920
in

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:49.119
Athens that's where they end up love it

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:52.119
if you're in Athens out there satanic

01:26:49.119 --> 01:26:55.960
congregation you got special place with

01:26:52.119 --> 01:26:59.360
me baby love okay get that off of there

01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:02.520
let me show you let me show you just a

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:05.119
um an example of this look at number one

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:08.320
in the exercises so you should be going

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:10.760
over the exercises and how do I force my

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.560
people to go over these exercises number

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:16.560
one when you look at this Greek sentence

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:18.440
don't even try to translate it tell me

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.080
what kind of conditional is it look at

01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:26.159
number one well it's got an e

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:27.280
on and what is its verb dedos sin oh

01:27:26.159 --> 01:27:31.960
that's a

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:37.040
subjunctive so we've got the pris of a

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:40.440
future more Vivid what is its apothesis

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:42.800
grap it's a future so what do we have

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:44.480
here a future more Vivid and what is the

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:49.000
translation

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:51.920
formula Almon for a future more Vivid

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:58.239
does will

01:27:51.920 --> 01:28:03.080
do okay so if those Muses teach the good

01:27:58.239 --> 01:28:08.320
poet well he will write a beautiful

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.320
book about the sacrifices in the

01:28:08.639 --> 01:28:16.040
agura okay so play that back to yourself

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:19.639
and realize you can do this every time

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:21.280
with a conditional every time with a

01:28:19.639 --> 01:28:24.159
conditional I want you to be able to

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:25.760
identify it which is this and how are

01:28:24.159 --> 01:28:27.920
are you going to do that you're going to

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:30.360
look at the if

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:32.960
clause and you're going to identify what

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:36.119
the verb is then you're going to look at

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:38.560
the then Clause you're going to identify

01:28:36.119 --> 01:28:42.119
what the verb is notice how you're not

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:43.600
thinking and then what are you gonna do

01:28:42.119 --> 01:28:45.760
you're G to look at that

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:47.280
chart and you're gonna say which one of

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:50.480
these is

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:53.560
this can identify it and plug in its

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:55.000
translation formula it's a future less

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:57.679
fvid

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.080
a plus optative optative plus on what's

01:28:57.679 --> 01:29:05.360
the translation should

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:08.000
would then you translate your sentence

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:09.600
if somebody should then somebody would

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.560
okay do you see what we're doing here

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.560
tonight people it's a good art it's a

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.880
good art you love this stuff you love

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.920
this stuff go ahead and take it down

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:22.600
chewy go ahead and take it down now what

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:26.400
do I expect I'm making these AR and it's

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:30.320
okay I'm making these amine

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:34.400
you sessions for you to be able to keep

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:37.400
up you should be doing two

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:40.400
things you should be memorizing your

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:44.679
vocabulary the best that you can and

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:48.679
what is the best that you can means it's

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:51.840
memorized okay now if you're waking up

01:29:48.679 --> 01:29:54.199
in Berkeley at 6: a.m and you're going

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:58.880
to your Bender

01:29:54.199 --> 01:30:00.719
um ba uh bathroom SL shower facility

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:03.480
which by the way I did not think that

01:30:00.719 --> 01:30:08.080
would work I did not think that would

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:10.920
work no I didn't but it did very well I

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:15.719
was shocked I was like well it's very

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:19.080
Pagan but people are kind of treating

01:30:15.719 --> 01:30:22.199
each other with dignity it's fantastic

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:25.760
it's fantastic um the other thing is you

01:30:22.199 --> 01:30:28.560
know got to wash the SLE s out of your

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:32.800
yeah never mind it's the way it goes

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:35.280
anyway um you can learn this the system

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:39.119
is for you

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:43.280
to commit to muscle

01:30:39.119 --> 01:30:47.159
memory the endings of the

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:49.199
words for you to commit to memory the

01:30:47.159 --> 01:30:50.960
chart of the conditional so that you

01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:54.679
know exactly what to do when you get

01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:56.159
into the pit and you're out there boom

01:30:54.679 --> 01:30:57.239
you get a conditional you know exactly

01:30:56.159 --> 01:31:00.639
how to break it down and how to

01:30:57.239 --> 01:31:03.000
translate it right no problem it's all

01:31:00.639 --> 01:31:04.040
muscle memory though so if you're going

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.600
to

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:08.840
Berkeley and you're doing this for six

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:11.080
hours a day and then you're going back

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:14.360
to your dorm and you're working an

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:18.040
additional four to six hours on it you

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:21.320
have time to cement it before the next

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:23.119
day shows up and you're sitting there

01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:26.040
and they tell you to Rattle off a

01:31:23.119 --> 01:31:28.880
paradigm and you can't do it and you're

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:30.800
in a bunch of people who can and you

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:35.600
look like a

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:37.880
dummy right now there are ways of

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:40.719
memorizing these

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:45.440
forms there are ways of memorizing these

01:31:40.719 --> 01:31:48.719
forms write them down if you are a

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:51.679
manual person write them down if you're

01:31:48.719 --> 01:31:54.440
a visual person get

01:31:51.679 --> 01:31:55.480
flashcards commit to memory whatever is

01:31:54.440 --> 01:32:00.440
your

01:31:55.480 --> 01:32:04.360
way some people will just do it

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:07.480
verbally just do it verbally

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:10.080
OA right just throw out those paradigms

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:12.560
get them out there whatever it takes for

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:14.840
you to commit these to memory you need

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:17.199
to these will be the tools that you

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:18.840
won't even think about using later you

01:32:17.199 --> 01:32:21.639
just take it for granted as part of the

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:24.760
system but this is the basic training

01:32:21.639 --> 01:32:27.679
