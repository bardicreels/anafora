of ritual sodomy

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.080

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.479

catechetical schools yield a wealth of

a consistent brutal and highly effective

means of indoctrination according to our

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.160
ancient sources if you were a Christian

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.340
were allowed to frequent the place where

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.319
the devil could be summoned

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.019
place where a priest could forever purge

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.959
them of their desire for sexual intimacy

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.840
it may be hard for a modern audience to

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.360
understand but in the early centuries of

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.200
the Common Era salvation was no joke

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.540
original sin was a doctrine that

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.120
non-christians ignored and even mocked

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.760
but Exorcist priests took it very

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.000
seriously and were specially trained to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
root it up every good Christian knew

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.120
that young boys particularly orphaned

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.560
children without the protection of

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.260
living parents were susceptible to

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.060
sexual impurity

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.340
something that would drag their souls

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.379
directly to hell

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.819
the only way to purge this impulse the

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.120
only way to save their souls was to

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.560
force them to undergo a sacred ceremony

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.480
a mysterious initiation that would

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.360
forever cleanse them of inappropriate

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.199

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.300

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.780
ritual exorcism is not difficult to

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.440
comprehend its theology is as elegant as

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.860
its rationale is unquestionable in the

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.919
mind of the Christian priests the world

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.240
is full of demons and these demons have

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.220
a peculiar affinity for naive

about the belief that Christians possess

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.280
the fiery breath that was able to send

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.440
demons out of the bodies of the

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.680
the touch of Christians or their breath

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.800
this fits the historical context well we

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.199
consider the Cyril of Jerusalem one of

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.419
the greatest Advocates of ritual sodomy

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.000
wrote in the pro-catechesis and

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.180
mystogical catechesis about the process

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.720
of breathing or blowing upon young nude

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.840
oiled boys

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.620
be Earnest he says in submitting to the

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.240
exorcisms if you were blown upon and

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.000
exercised the process brings you to

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.720
Salvation

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.940
the battle for the soul revolved around

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.780
the sexual encounter of these youths and

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.759
the Christians thought it could be one

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.340
if the young were given a chance to

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.680
renounce the devil

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.800
in the face of direct unavoidable

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.419
temptation

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.940
what better way to give sexually

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.220
inexperienced children the opportunity

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.280
to embrace salvation than to summon

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.300
Lucifer himself let the devil offer the

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.639
Pains of Temptation

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.360
then let the young reject him and flee

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.620
to Jesus

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.139
the reasoning of The Exorcist priests

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.500
who ended up sodomizing boys was really

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.460
that simple post-ritual counseling was

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.300
invaluable after all that's what Cyril

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.819
the bishop of Jerusalem had commanded of

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.280
his Exorcist priests that's what Clement

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.440
the head of the catechetical school in

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.160
Alexandria required of his students and

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.020
church Elders like Cyril and Clement

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.599
were after all bearers of the Divine

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:36.780
commission they were only a few

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.120
Generations removed from the master

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.500
himself

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.740
their Authority was impeccable and their

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.680
dictates were obeyed because they were

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.479
coming directly from God

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.500
if you were a priest involved with

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.199
catechesis you were expected to teach

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:01.319
children that forced intercourse is only

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:05.400
a sin if it is enjoyed the distinction

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.819
between willful enjoyment of sodomy and

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:11.699
forced enjoyment was critical to Cyril

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:15.000
after all according to Christian dogma

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.240
if shunned any sort of sexual activity

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.539
became a means of purification that is

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:24.720
the job of The Exorcist was to summon

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.360
the devil let the Prince of Darkness

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.419
offer the Temptation through you and

00:08:30.419 --> 00:08:33.659
then let the child reject the act the

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.240
successful initiate would be guaranteed

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.300
salvation and you the priest would be

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.240
doing the work of Christ the ritual

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.480
purification by sodomy was carefully

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.440
prescribed and executed the catechetical

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.500

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.580
remain consistent throughout the Empire

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.519
according to the bishop of Jerusalem

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:03.060
there must be an orthodox method of

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.600
exorcism this meant that Exorcist

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.420
priests were bound to follow the

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.120
writings of Bishops and to allow local

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.180
authorities to determine who was worthy

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.080
of assisting in such sacred duties Saint

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.680
Ambrose tells us that priests elders and

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.260
Bishops were all present but most

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.959
importantly priests and initiates were

00:09:27.959 --> 00:09:31.560
forbidden from discussing the details of

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.260

the onerous burden of summoning the

Devil Himself and those who were

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.019
successfully initiated could understand

don't talk carelessly not because what

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.480
you were told isn't fair to talk about

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.959
but because the listener isn't fit to

00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:24.060
hear it the church fathers were well

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.680
aware that the pagans would eventually

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.899
accuse Priests of crimes if they ever

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:30.240

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.320
initiation

again into the way and their natural

inclination was to defend the demons

they worshiped in short pagans were

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:46.260
considered to be of the spirit of

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.240
reinforced repetition of Christian

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.120
doctrine was the reason the process came

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.959
to be known as catechesis which is just

00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:19.380
a Greek word for placing Doctrine into

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.980
the ears of novitiates and Latin

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.079
catechesis is transliterated as

00:11:27.079 --> 00:11:30.839
indoctrination after weeks of starvation

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:33.240
and repetitive indoctrination children

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.700
deemed ready for the initiation ceremony

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.980
were taken to an out of the way chamber

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.380
or location where they were sequestered

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.240
from the general population of

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.579
novitiates in the first step of the

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:47.160
process of initiation priests removed

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.279
all of the clothing of these boys if the

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:52.079
children showed any evidence of being

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:54.600
ashamed to stand before a group of

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.240
priests naked Cyril commanded that

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.720
they'd be reminded that Jesus was

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.899
himself crucified without his clothing

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:06.660
they had no need of embarrassment to

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.160
stand as Jesus stood naked before the

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.459
world

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.660
Cyril's own words from his mystical

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.260
catechesis as soon as you entered you

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.560
took off your tunic

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.220
once you had taken it off you were naked

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.760
what a wonderful thing you were naked in

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.959
the eyes of all and felt no shame

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:43.200
then once you had removed your clothes

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.920
you were Anointed with exercise oil from

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.920
the top most hairs of your head

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.260
to the lowest parts of your body

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.760
after disrobing the children the priests

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.880
blindfolded them and then explained that

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.100
their actions were a necessary step in

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.519
protecting the children from The Gaze of

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:10.200
the devil

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.839
next the priest rubbed the boys

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:15.839
generously with a sacred oil the sacred

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:18.480
oil like the anointing oils also used by

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.880
the Christians contained drugs that

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.579
would undoubtedly facilitate the process

00:13:23.579 --> 00:13:26.339
of exposing the children to the

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:29.639
Temptation offered by Lucifer in short

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:32.760
it would numb them to the burning fires

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.380
of the devil

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.540
[Music]

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.480
following Cyril's instructions

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.760
pre-supplied the oil to the boys from

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.860
the crown of their heads to the soles of

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.139
their feet it was an important Priestly

00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:49.079
duty to ensure that the children were

00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:51.959
completely covered and that the holy oil

00:13:51.959 --> 00:13:55.279
was rubbed into the skin thoroughly

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:59.220
after all it served as a barrier for

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.920
their own protection and once it was

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.320
applied the boys were forever

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.660
consecrated to Christ

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.000
necessity of rubbing the entire body

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.640
with oil

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.820
naked oiled children

00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:30.660
once the children were prepped in this

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.940
manner and knelt and the hidden recesses

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.339
of the church naked blindfolded and

00:14:35.339 --> 00:14:37.680
covered with oil The Exorcist then

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.899
proceeded to summon the devil once

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:42.480
Lucifer had been summoned he made his

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.420
presence known to the initiates they

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.060
heard his voice and became terribly

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.540
afraid the boys were then commanded to

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.260
rebuke the devil while facing him then

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.500
they were told to turn their back to him

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.300
at this point

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.899
possessed Exorcist applied the fires of

00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:07.320
Temptation Cyril forbade this knowledge

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.839
from becoming public lest the Pagan

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:12.480
World misinterpreted and caused criminal

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.220
trouble for priests

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.040
what we do know about the fires of

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.980
Temptation is that at least one

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.800
Christian Author reveals them as the act

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.600
of sodomy

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.139
in other words the Prince of Darkness

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:32.339
the author of the first Temptation while

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:35.180
inhabiting the body of an exorcist

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.480
forced prepubescent boys to submit to

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.260
anal intercourse the devil was said to

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.620
have done this in a violent manner but

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.320
the children were allowed to suffer the

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.320
Temptation forced on them by the

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.139
possessed Exorcist because this

00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:58.560
supported them an opportunity to rebuke

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.000
the pleasure of the sin and thus obtain

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.170
salvation

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.600
[Music]

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.880
the priests who were present during the

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.600
application of the fires of Temptation

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.279
encouraged the children to flee the

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:17.220
sexual advances of the devil and they

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.800
were told that they should not enjoy the

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.440
experience the priests helped the

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.899
children to call upon the name of the

00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:27.959
Lord to see past the pain of Temptation

00:16:27.959 --> 00:16:31.740
to the relief of Salvation when the

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.680
devil was present applying the sexual

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.860
Temptation the boys were told to rebuke

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.459
him in the name of Jesus they rebuked

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:44.279
his acts of violence they rebuked his

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:46.320
offer of carnal pleasure

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.320
helping the children to renounce this

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.180
forced sexual act allowed them to accept

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.380
Eternal salvation

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.959
after the devil was rebuked he

00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:03.180
reportedly fled the scene and the

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.918
priests witnessed The Exorcist

00:17:04.919 --> 00:17:07.620
exhausting release the children were

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.380
then taken to a sacred bath where they

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.740
were baptized and thus cleansed of any

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.100
stain they emerged from the Waters of

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.199
cleansing to a New Life

00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:21.900
then they were given white robes to

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.480
cover their nakedness a symbol of the

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.720
Purity they gained from renouncing the

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.200
devil these robes would have been made

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.100
of the same material as the bandage that

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.039
covered the naked boy who was with Jesus

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:40.919
in a Garden of Gethsemane when he was

00:17:40.919 --> 00:17:43.519
arrested

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.679
after this ceremony the boys were

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:51.780
returned to the priests involved in

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.419
their initiation in order to purge

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:57.780
themselves of any violent memories of

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.780
the fires of Temptation

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.419
priests then repeated their instructions

00:18:03.419 --> 00:18:05.580
that the details of their initiations

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.299
were to remain a mystery telling others

00:18:09.299 --> 00:18:13.140
about their experience was a sin the

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.780
boys were reminded that hell awaits

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.700
those who are disobedient finally they

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.980
were given food to a Christian priest

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.720
living in the earliest years of the

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.660
church salvation was not a joke priests

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.340
thought the children allowed to go on

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.440
living as pagans would be sent to hell

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.900
for eternity

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.059
initiating them into the way

00:18:36.059 --> 00:18:38.760
would ultimately save their souls from

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.299
an eternity of pain and suffering this

00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:44.400
must be the reason the priests took such

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.679
drastic measures to save the Youth of

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:49.559
the world the Pains of the fires of

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:52.400
sexual Temptation were far less horrific

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.640
than an eternity in the Underworld

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.340
whether or not modern Catholic priests

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.080
are following the tradition of

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.600
institutional rape created by the

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.580
earliest Christian clergy

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.700
has so far eluded the public

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.039
even a cursory look at the earliest

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:13.380
writings of the Christians reveals that

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.380
ritual rape was an Institutional

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:21.179
standard used in processing initiates it

00:19:21.179 --> 00:19:24.299
is not unreasonable to assume that the

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:27.299
theological justification for sodomizing

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:31.020
young boys is still present in the ranks

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.680
of Catholic priests

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.009
[Music]

00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:39.480
the rape of children in the modern

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.320
Christian Church may not be as organized

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.419
as it was when the church first

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:48.840
developed but child abuse clearly

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.660
remains an Institutional problem

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.380
for reasons that continue to elude

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.179
investigators the church actively

00:19:57.179 --> 00:19:59.820
Fosters and protects the practice of

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.120
child molestation and sexual assault

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.580
priests have sexually abused children

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.120
for centuries and Bishops have always

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.740
protected these rapists from prosecution

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.620
Catholic church has remained very much

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.799
the same for two thousand years

00:20:19.799 --> 00:20:23.640
problem of child rape may never be

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.740
rooted out of the church

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.740
