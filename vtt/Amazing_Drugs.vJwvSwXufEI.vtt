the plant in a small village on the edge of the Empire right oh isn't that nice well

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.080
noting that although she cannot rule out its consumption before the Roman period

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:02.840

okay let's go to the next uh yes that one okay so tell us about the toxicon tell us about now I'm going to put these

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:37.919
on leave them on and read it to you people are like hey what what is that guy doing okay um it's called the

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:46.200
toxicon because they go ahead and they Christ their arrows with it but for those who drink it their lips and their

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:52.840
tongues swell up and they get a Mania that is uncontrollable where they

00:18:52.840 --> 00:19:00.039
see a all sorts of hallucinations and on account of this

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:06.480
right the therapy is is impossible they're impossible to deal with and

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:14.120
rarely can you save somebody when they're when they've drunk it like this

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:19.880
oh my God and um what do you have to do tell me Doc what do you do can you feel

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:26.520
yourself there right um what do you do for this person you put chains on them

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:33.159
and you force them to throw up using edics and he gives a whole list of

00:19:33.159 --> 00:19:39.159
things that you're going to have to force this person to force this person to drink and vomit and then there's all

00:19:39.159 --> 00:19:44.919
sorts of plants that they want you to give him to deal with it to try to counteract but he says here's the

00:19:44.919 --> 00:19:51.320
problem here's the problem this is the beauty at the end of this passage right here's the problem he

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:57.440
says um there are some that escape the

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:03.640
danger of this drug and those people they end up

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.919
bedridden yeah and when they can finally get

00:20:08.919 --> 00:20:14.760
up um there's something wrong with them for the remaining

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:20.919
time their remaining time they are in a state of

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:28.039
constant paranoid Terror oh my god seriously what did you

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:33.440
do to them what did you do to these people's brains bro what are they doing

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:39.960
in Antiquity to people's brains holy mackerel I thought that

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:47.440
whole story of that Bronze Age Queen who um was was poisoning people and

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.960
castrating them and turning them into sex toys that she would beat

00:20:52.960 --> 00:21:00.679
mercilessly um that they were always in a state of of total AB

00:21:00.679 --> 00:21:07.360
servitude wow you can actually make that kind of

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:15.279
person yeah yeah it's getting deep it's getting deep look for those of you who

00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:22.720
have weak stomachs Now's the Time take out your vomit bags and we'll make our way into it

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:29.320
let's get to the next one I got some chunkiness here people I know you I know you'd love it

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:35.000
where's the chunkiness oh yeah bring it in that's the next one yeah um look for

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.159
those of you who are in my Greek course and come to dojo and work out right look

00:21:40.159 --> 00:21:46.600
you can see hermafroditismo dates right he's a

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:52.880
doctor dude give him a little credit um and he says Hey and you know I had the privilege of sitting down with a student

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.720
of mine in Greek who is also a doctor and she was able to talk this talk

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:04.520
through this flash up some diagrams the development and what happens oh my boom

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.159
bang Bing there it is nature all lined out hermaphrodite what what happens here

00:22:10.159 --> 00:22:17.480
I want you to just think for a minute the conclusion here at the end we're going to end up we're going to end up

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:28.000
performing some surgery in order to create the best of the four different

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.679
types of genders that hermaphrodites have and you're like what what yeah he

00:22:35.679 --> 00:22:44.159
says just wait and not only that he says somebody else is writing about this right he's apparently it's common enough

00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:49.600
at the time for the doctors around to be aware of you know hey there are four

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.880
types of hermaphrodites right depending on positioning the genitalia and he

00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:01.720
talks about positioning and I'm scratching my head doc can you make you can you make sense of this right oh but

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:08.000
we end up we end up doing a little surgery isn't that nice artificial

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.159
insemination and gender surgery did you know they did that in Antiquity in the

00:23:13.159 --> 00:23:21.000
society that created calculus with their words did you know that these are the

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:29.400
people who said we go around the Sun wow isn't that amazing you think

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:35.240
you'd think they would have been able to beat that out of people in the Middle Ages thank you so much to the people

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:40.640
thank you so much to the um Christians in the Middle Ages yes oh he's going to

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:47.720
blame Christianity no I'm just blaming the Christians who at the time were torturing and killing people for their

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:55.520
beliefs right to those people who made the Middle Ages such a dump my apologies to Medieval historians

00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:02.480
but your period is a dump yeah yeah it is thank thank the Muse that there was

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:11.320
some Byzantine some Byzantine Scholars to stand in your way oh God oh God um where

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:16.760
does my allegiance lie lies with The Muse in the museum love it let's go to

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:22.840
the next one her or to the hermaphrodite let's just finish off a couple of I just wanted you to notice a couple of things

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:29.159
about the her afrodite here that's all um we have to consider that of these

00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:36.399
four types the genders are going to be determined very anatomically and very

00:24:36.399 --> 00:24:41.520
logically um but we don't have any problem we don't have any problem this

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:47.480
is not um a something that is um fatal

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:54.480
right determining gender is the process that the ancient physician has to be a

00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:01.200
part of um isn't that interesting wow it's gorgeous um but remember they'

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:07.159
their technology is Way Beyond um where you think it it was um their chemical

00:25:07.159 --> 00:25:14.140
technolog is Way Beyond that okay so let's uh let's go to the next one I want to shock and awe people

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:20.640
[Music] um boom okay people look what else I brought this is just dirty dirty stuff

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.919
are you ready and when I mean dirty I mean intellectually dirty don't don't be

00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:31.799
don't be foul right love it take a look at this what is this this is about the

00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:39.559
nomia oh wait what is that that's the nyoy a num as we have already seen as my

00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:48.000
Greek students know is translated as clitoris um what he says here is Hooper

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:56.799
Mees what happens a Hooper Mees NTI it comes about that this

00:25:56.799 --> 00:26:03.720
ginormous clitter sometimes is the result of the

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:10.679
hermaphroditic thing and this thing he says this clitoris now imagine this

00:26:10.679 --> 00:26:15.919
imagine this a clitoris that he says becomes

00:26:15.919 --> 00:26:24.840
wrecked just like a penis fantastic can you can you imagine

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:32.399
that what a brilliant bit of nature that's amazing that's amazing fantastic

00:26:32.399 --> 00:26:38.600
and there it is there it is for you to see right and remember these hermaphrodites they are part of the

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.880
religion if you cut hermaphroditism out of the ancient

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:52.520
mystery um it won't stand you can't have it sorry you can't have it remember

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.880
aphrod the very earliest depictions put some Aphrodite up there please chewy the

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:05.360
very very earliest depictions of Aphrodite are of her with what looks

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:12.320
like a penis and for all of you biologists out there who do not have you

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:19.720
know who have public decency um you know that the same tissue that the clitoris

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:27.159
is um becomes the penis right the default is the female right we were all

00:27:27.159 --> 00:27:32.559
females I'm sorry but at one point we were all females and then the

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:38.840
testosterone hit some of us and screwed things up yeah isn't that funny we're a

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:45.919
degenerate form biologically um the masculine form is the degenerate it only makes sense X Y

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:52.120
why is you Bo that little chromosome it's it's damaged

00:27:52.120 --> 00:28:01.039
right yeah don't you love that so oh right XX why love it um Let's do let's

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:06.880
go to the let's go back to the text the and we don't need to go back to the um

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:12.559
what do they do surgically they do what they consult um with the parents would

00:28:12.559 --> 00:28:18.440
be the best thing right um You you're he he says you're doing it with the sense

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:24.919
of propriety for the child right and so they decide what to do and and in one

00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:33.519
case it's when your clitoris is huge like a penis um then they will cut part of it

00:28:33.519 --> 00:28:43.600
off um and shape it so that it returns to um approximate you know um uh uh an

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:52.360
average clitoris or as close as they can get right remember they're nipping and tucking the the scrotal tissue as well

00:28:52.360 --> 00:29:00.240
right um these are people who I mean just that physician that we were looking at Paul a vagina he's known for being a

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:08.159
the best guy to repair hernas right so if he knows how to repair hernia he probably is also um

00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:15.600
repaired a few uh scrotal you know tissue things and talked to him here and

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:22.720
you know the perineum is right there and he mentions the perineum right this is you know where we are

one that's getting them um is the fact that the septu it's written in the 3

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.560
century and that it's originally written in Greek and and that your words like

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:02.720
Christ they have nothing to do with Messiah they have nothing to do with

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:10.040
Messiah or anointing no they don't they don't the Christ thing is a completely

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:17.839
different process it was the people who wanted to control the narrative namely

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:26.240
the Orthodox Jews and the Christians right right those people

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:32.280
needed to create a narrative and the one that they created is so absurd that even

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:38.640
the Greeks and Romans standing around looking at them said are you joking your

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:44.760
narrative is stupid and impossible right we're historians here

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:51.800
we don't um we don't play in fancy and fantasy what are you talking about oh

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:58.760
God so um no it turns out that Christ that word Christ is not it's got nothing

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:06.280
to do with any sort of tradition outside of the mystery tradition where

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:11.839
the Christ is a term that is used for the dude who is drugged out of his

00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:19.200
mind yeah who has that what what was it it was the breast

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:27.079
Bud of God and when I say God I don't mean he yeah yeah you know how they get that

00:38:27.079 --> 00:38:34.960
they get that with the Venom they get that with the Venom well what do you call

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:40.079

00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:18.800
talking about the purple and I just want to wanted to point out that it's also talking about um treating and healing um

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:25.119
what are considered growths right you can debate about what kind of growths those were and what they could see on

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:31.880
the surface of the skin and whatnot but okay okay the the stuff kills growths um this

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:36.960
is the purple it's here people it's a drug it's an actual drug John Stewart

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:42.560
educate yourself buddy it's a drug fantastic go to the next one um look

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:50.760
here at the bottom I just want you to see here at the bottom see the pom um you can also drink the purple right you

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:55.960
can drink the purple if your little fingers if you're a 12-year-old girl

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:01.400
named Mary Mother of God and your little purple fingers are staying from the

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:07.599
purple that you work with um this is the kind of formulaic knowledge that you

00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:16.079
have to have to be able to stay alive and by the way they're going to auction you off wait is this Greek no that part

00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:23.359
of it is not they're gonna auction her off to whoever's got the right lot right

00:40:23.359 --> 00:40:29.680
they're basically going to throw her out there why because this is what they do in the temp Temple it's merchandising

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:35.119
isn't it funny merchandising creeps into the mystery and at

00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:42.880
Jerusalem it becomes about the sale of the Virgin wow can you believe that do you

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:50.960
know what happens when mystery is profaned in that way with cash with

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:58.280
property with gain of goods and history and justification for what you do to

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:04.560
people do you know what that does the mystery implodes to cleanse

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:13.240

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:12.079
you showed a little clip of your um

00:55:12.079 --> 00:55:17.319
somebody um Dan mlen right and he is

00:55:17.319 --> 00:55:23.680
asked a question by one of his many um followers he's asked a question hey um

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:30.680
what is this about dianis and Jesus one of the parallels between them and he of

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:36.960
course mockingly and very and very arrogant Dan Dan cut the arrogance dude

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:43.000
it doesn't it doesn't suit you um and I know your Greek sucks bra and I'll I'll

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.640
literally break you in half um through the Greek right intellectually

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:55.680
intellectually Dan I'm gonna I'm gonna take your pants down and I'm gonna do things to you yeah but here's the

00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:03.160
problem um I think Neil has basically already done that and um um I just want

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:09.119
Neil is it true do you think Dan I'm just gonna ask you this because I don't want to get you in trouble and I don't

00:56:09.119 --> 00:56:15.440
want other people to be I can talk about it I can say some here you want me to say this so I was disappointed in this

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:21.200
video because when the person asks him a question about something that he he probably doesn't know about or wasn't

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:27.880
immersed in or never heard of instead of just saying I you know I don't have any idea to that question there's probably

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:34.680
look look there's probably other classicists who can answer that question I'm a Bible scholar that would have been like a a good answer or does not make

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:40.880
the video but what he did was he did this weird thing and this isn't in my video this isn't his video I I didn't

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:47.000
want to waste all the time show I'm not trying to like waste time on his video it was only a quick intro but what he

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:55.119
did was he did this weird thing where he pulled up an article from like 40 50 years ago that no one talks about or it

00:56:55.119 --> 00:57:02.400
was a Tren I'm sorry it wasn't an article it was a translation of the baky it was a bad translation a lot of people

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:08.280
have already ackn classist have already shut this thing down and said this is trash nobody this is not nobody takes

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:14.319
this thing seriously I've never even heard of it so he brings up this translation that's bad and goes this guy

00:57:14.319 --> 00:57:19.359
in this really bad translation tries to say seil is a virgin he says samile

00:57:19.359 --> 00:57:27.520
wrong and I'm just saying to myself why does he okay in my video I I cited like 10

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:33.319
Scholars who have written about this Dennis McDonald Carl Ruck uh kristo

00:57:33.319 --> 00:57:38.960
krysto ball uh I can't remember her her her name uh you know I I literally it's

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:44.119
all in my video I go through and say this person wrote about L uh the Gospel

00:57:44.119 --> 00:57:50.839
of Luke and the and the baky this person wrote about the Gospel of John and the baky nonas did this um this other

00:57:50.839 --> 00:57:57.359
Christian authors did this the Ning Peter said this this scholar from this place said this this scar I'm like I'm

00:57:57.359 --> 00:58:02.960
like going through all the material and like that for some reason none of that gets brought up in the video but instead

00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:08.520
you brought up this random translation of the baky and said see this is not

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:15.400
good stuff don't don't look into this stuff it's all just bunch of people looking and squinting and trying to figure out but like that's a that was a

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:21.039
really to me that was like um and you know I was going to say this about about about people like Bart

00:58:21.039 --> 00:58:27.960
Airman and uh Dennis M or uh and um Dan mlen who are great great Bible scholars

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:34.760
but when they start talking about stuff outside of the Bible they don't look that great I'm just saying Bart Airman

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:41.280
has been I've I've seen seen him write articles where he confuses Demetrius with diogenes it's like dude you're out

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:47.599
of your element it's fine nobody's an expert in everything you don't have to be the all religion Guru of the world

00:58:47.599 --> 00:58:55.839
like just stay with what you know don't try to like get all and I think there's like this I think it's in the circles

00:58:55.839 --> 00:59:02.400
where there's this like sort of a Dogma in making Christianity this like like

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:09.599
because here's what I think is going on these are critical Scholars who are very good at being critical of a lot of stuff

00:59:09.599 --> 00:59:17.440
in the Bible that fundamentalists are pushing Dan ml's all over that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to his credit I love it so is B Airman but

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:23.359
they have this other side where it's like I don't know if it's like they're trying to balance their themselves out

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:29.440
when any chance they get to credit it's like almost like if it's so obvious the side goes to the

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:34.680
uh critical side they'll they'll they'll attack it and say this is wrong but if there's any doubt that Christianity

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:40.760
could have something right they just credit that they just say this is correct or the dating of the text or something I don't know if this makes

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:46.760
sense to you but do you understand what I'm saying by that there's this like mentality where in the SP circles where

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:52.119
Christianity is special unique and needs to be in its own box separate from all

00:59:52.119 --> 01:00:00.240
the other Classics and that to me is where I think they screw grew up their entire system of of epistemology how

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:06.000
they they just there the Christianity is in this special world with a force field around it and there's no influence it's

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.760
a Greek text it's in Greek that's why that's why neoc

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:17.160
classicist laugh and I'm really underneath I'm blustery I'm really

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:23.400
laughing at Dan mclen I'm laughing at him because he has a show going i' I

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:29.079
watched some of his stuff and he leads you on as if he has this knowledge and

01:00:29.079 --> 01:00:35.000
you can tell he really doesn't it was the same thing with Kip Davis you can tell when he made a statement about

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.640
Greek he had no idea what he was talking about intellectually intellectually

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:46.359
these guys need to be driven to a place of Shame where where where um because of

01:00:46.359 --> 01:00:52.880
what they're doing the our viewers out there they don't know they don't know right whether or not he's really that

01:00:52.880 --> 01:01:01.400
good and Greek or not they don't know if his arguments are sound and pastors all over the world do that and it's a it's

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:08.720
like a little device that it's like you know you see someone taking advantage of a kid Dan mlen is taking advantage of

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:14.559
that innocence that somebody's gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and

01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:21.240
that kind of Kip Davis stuff Dan mlen that stuff is disreputable boys you gota

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:26.480
you gotta you got to stand up for for the wrong that you're doing you love it

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:32.680
love it that's what I would encourage them you know in the in the spirit of healing and cleansing I would encourage

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:38.640
you to step up guys and to say look you know we were we were just kind of using

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:44.400
authority over you we really don't do this work when you get into these texts

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:51.119
you see the total opposite so tell me how do you think Dan took your video do you think he saw I have no idea I have

01:01:51.119 --> 01:01:57.559
no idea to be honest um and I don't care because the video wasn't really about just him it was just

01:01:57.559 --> 01:02:03.559
kind of like an intro to show look this is a topic that is not well researched

01:02:03.559 --> 01:02:09.200
in my opinion and I think um here here here's what I think's going on the

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:15.160
classicists are letting the Bible scholars keep the Bible and let let them deal with it and then the the the Bible

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:22.559
scholars are saying well the classicists aren't saying anything about dianis and Jesus so why we so it must not be there

01:02:22.559 --> 01:02:29.440
which is not true technically because a lot of classist have said stuff about this and then they get responses like well

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:35.200
the Bible scholars aren't saying this so how are you right and there's like these two bubbles happening and if and if if

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:42.480
you just train New Testament scholars in Classics then this whole thing might open up because you know and I Kip Davis

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:48.839
is my friend I'm not gonna talk crap about him but I asked him this is this You're gonna laugh and you hear this and

01:02:48.839 --> 01:02:54.920
and this is not me talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is just kept being honest and he told me this how much Greek cuz he has a he has

01:02:54.920 --> 01:03:00.480
a PHD not in Ted SE Scrolls and didn't know this he has a PHD in Theology and

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.839
religion and I go what so how much Greek did you have to learn theology is a

01:03:05.839 --> 01:03:12.680
Greek word comes from Plato comes from Orpheus to Theologian it comes from the Greeks it's a Greek thing theology is a

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:18.480
Greek thing and I'm thinking to myself how much Greek did you were you required to get this P how much play Plato did

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.880
you have to read he laughed and said none I'm like why don't they just give

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:29.559
you a degree and says Dey SC because he's a he's a whiz of the Dead SE Scrolls he's a whiz he knows everything

01:03:29.559 --> 01:03:35.079
about the dead he can tell you what manuscript numbers and what verses he knows all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's trained in that

01:03:35.079 --> 01:03:40.799
but I'm like why do they give you that title then just weird it's just a weird thing because these people they kind of

01:03:40.799 --> 01:03:46.720
present themselves as Scholars of religion but it's like how much about same thian Mysteries huh what about

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:51.799
sasus huh what about the thians what about what about like we can go into

01:03:51.799 --> 01:03:59.880
like all this stuff that never gets talked about by any Bible ever right ever what what about the Theo

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:05.640
syis those in the second century BC what about that what are you talking about yeah well they don't know like they this

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:12.000
is like gibberish to them they don't they're not none of them in their whole eight to 10 years are going to school

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:20.480
that ever this stuff doesn't even get brought up it's only in the classicist world yeah no I I I saw Both Worlds Neil

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:27.200
I I got my degree in Classics and taught in Classics and I taught at a seminary

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:35.079
and I can tell you for a fact it's giving them the ability to be able to go back to those texts that's that thing is

01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:40.400
revolutionary when you can give somebody the ability to see the history for what

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:46.440
it was not through any kind of filter that has that's based on theology or IDE

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:52.680
any ideology but just the facts of the history just the the real sauce um you

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:57.920
you liberate them you liberate them the best thing you could do for Christianity

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:04.359
is to give them leaders who could actually read those texts sure and I I

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:11.039
tell my students every semester that I was in seminary I'm not there anymore because as you know you know they

01:05:11.039 --> 01:05:16.839
thought that I somebody saw me fly through some walls and do some magic um

01:05:16.839 --> 01:05:23.599
which whatever you know it's all inadmissible right um so uh when you're

01:05:23.599 --> 01:05:28.960
in that situation as a class you can see how important it is um that that that

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:34.400
they're able to find that source and work with the source and Christians

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:42.200
don't do that I've never met I've not met one yet um that is a real master of

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:47.599
classical Greek and Latin never never so we'll see we'll see what happens maybe

01:05:47.599 --> 01:05:55.720
that's a challenge tell us one last thing about this then I want to go I want to show you some stuff about Adam the adamus

01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:01.279
stuff I have some stuff on that Kyle Rook was the first to really do what

01:06:01.279 --> 01:06:07.520
you're doing right now and going to the trenches and challenge some of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so at the if you if you read his book

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:14.200
The Road to El usus the book that was heavily criticized and shot down and then Vindicated over time as these as

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:19.599
Classics as Classics caught up to him basically that's kind of funny if you think about it's true Classics caught up

01:06:19.599 --> 01:06:26.799
to K Ruck now how does that how does one person get so you he smarter than everyone else is he got a higher no it's

01:06:26.799 --> 01:06:33.559
not that he's reading the text he's immersed in the world of Greek he loves it he does it for fun this is the

01:06:33.559 --> 01:06:38.920
difference between somebody who just goes to college to be a professor and they just read modern articles from

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:44.680
Modern scholarship and think that's all you have to do and then don't read the primary sources so I'll give you an

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:52.000
example at the end of his book The Road to Al usus he talks he a debunking section at the end it's in the appendix

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.400
and he talks about the the current he's talking about the current AR archeologist he names the guy I forgot

01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:02.839
the person's name some sort of Professor PhD archaeologist who was digging up

01:07:02.839 --> 01:07:10.520
elus and this guy starts talking about there is no connection to Deiter and dianis at all we haven't found anything

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.920
in the archaeology and KY Ruck was like dude even if you even if that's true

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:23.000
that you found nothing in El USIS of dianis you're just wrong this is what the sources say boom boom bo bo bo bo bo

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:30.760
bo boom bo bo bo bo boom just obliterate some with the primary text strabo says this by the way yakos is a term it's a

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:36.160
name for dianis it's also a name for demer and only them two shared that title no one else you don't see that

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:41.920
with Apollo nobody else so it's like yeah you maybe you maybe you have an

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:47.400
understanding of like the archaeology and you're you're looking at the data the raw data and you say all I see is

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:54.400
this so therefore it's all that like this is one of those things where you think about if a tree falls down in a

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:59.520
place that no one's there to see it did it happen and the answer is yes it

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.760
happened but now how do we find that we have to find out how it how to how to

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:10.640
how to uh document stuff that's not in the that's not me necessarily like we

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:16.960
have to be able to connect the dots and we have to be able to do interpret the data and by the way d m always says this

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:22.199
in the data he always says in the data which is fine this is a good good the data doesn't always mean you're going to

01:08:22.199 --> 01:08:28.440
find it saying adamus is where Adam comes from you're not going to find a text that

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:34.520
says that you have to do the work and you have to read the text and interpret the data to find this stuff out so

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:41.480
that's what I'm getting at I'm saying some of this stuff might sound speculative but then we we're talking about the data as a whole then it starts

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:47.318
to make sense when you when you're immerse in these texts this stuff makes more sense that's all I'm saying not

01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:53.880
saying I'm smarter than everybody or I'm not an expert and they're not I'm just saying there's certain things where if you are and this is just being a nerd

01:08:53.880 --> 01:09:01.238
actually you can find Star Wars nerds who know more about Star Wars than some of the directors of Star Wars probably

01:09:01.239 --> 01:09:09.000
because they're just like super nerdy at it wait a minute actually actually Darth Vader said this oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I did write that

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:16.199
like and that's a thing like sometimes just being very immerse and loving this stuff for for just as because that's

01:09:16.199 --> 01:09:23.640
part of who you are gives you that upper like that K Ruck Advantage yeah and you know what that's

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:31.880
why you gotta love the guy and his draw to that that language and those texts is so

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.679
strong you can see it in his eyes um there's a there's a tenderness about him

01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:43.000
and it's a it's a beautiful beautiful love for that beauty that is classical

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:49.120
Greek heiti um he swims in that and he has so much you don't understand the

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:55.520
ground that Carl Rock has covered right you people out there like Kip and and

01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:01.400
Dan um they have studied more than he's forgotten right I mean he's I said that

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:09.120
backwards he's forgotten more than they have studied probably right I mean he he's that close he really respects the

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:15.600
Muse Carl rock is a is a man who followed the Muse his his life and I I

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:21.360
have tremendous respect for him um here's to you here's to you Luc for what

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:26.400
you've what you've brought and he was you're right Neil he was standing in the

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:31.600
breach right when those other classist were back just securing their jobs and

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:38.120
getting a little bit the little bit of Fame that they could possibly get they were saying they were saying harsh things about him they were like really

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.560
going after his character like assassinating his character as a as a human being beyond the scholarship like

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:50.440
he was getting so much hate for the stuff that he was producing in his in his text and then all of a sudden 20

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:58.000
years goes by and then there's more research being done into entho Jens and and El indan Mysteries and Greek mystery

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.360
calls all of a sudden it's like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everything everything he's been saying is coming to light and like all

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:10.600
those people who criticized him 20 years ago look like morons that don't know the St material and I I predict that 20

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:16.920
years from now this is what we're GNA be saying about scholars in the that's what I'm saying yeah could be wrong totally I

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:22.080
totally agree I totally agree okay Neil tell me really quick what is the new

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:28.960
area that you're going to be working on for your next video I just just want like people it's coming

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:35.120
along okay I just I'm almost done with it already I'm coming along quick I have the whole

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:41.400
10,000w uh script written out 10,000 words um it's about the pans Proto IND

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:50.800
Europeans cians Thracians um Kelts uh Germanic pagans italic pagans

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:56.360
um going all the way to India into the Hindu stuff and I'm doing a and I'm

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:02.360
showing how all the stuff is connected that's my next video I already have I

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:11.679
already started recording on the microphone I'm already like halfway through it it's gonna be out quick I hope I hope you do the palasan oh it's I

01:12:11.679 --> 01:12:19.320
introduce them as the palasan I basically say in the video from not you know whatever whether you want to call them palasan eurasians Aryans I don't

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:25.719
care this is what we're we're getting at the same thing right and I'm so glad you're doing it because there's so many

01:12:25.719 --> 01:12:32.719
classical sources that just throw them in just a mention of them oh yeah FY it's was originally plasan right well

01:12:32.719 --> 01:12:40.400
you know throw they just throw that stuff in and you're like who are these pans and classicists have traditionally

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:45.520
ignored them ignore them not only that they they say it's mythological people

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:51.360
but hold hold on a second though they're only brought up well I guess Homer writes about him in Iliad and stuff like

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:57.840
that but whatever you could say that's M but even Homer is not talking about them in a mythological sense he's talking

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:02.960
about he literally throws them into tribes like home world names six tribes

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:08.679
all five of those tribes are real tribes and then pans are next to them so wait you're telling me the only this one

01:13:08.679 --> 01:13:15.360
tribe didn't exist but these five do Herodotus mentions the pans a hundred times probably not aund times I'm just

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:21.400
exaggerating he mentions them all throughout his text he did never says these are mythological people he's

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:28.679
they're talking about the pans no like that's not the that's not how they're being described in the ancient sources

01:13:28.679 --> 01:13:33.719
so we're just interpreting it our own way saying well we can't find anything that we can't find any people that call

01:13:33.719 --> 01:13:40.800
themselves pans in any text that's because these people existed before writing so whether we call them this is

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:47.000
what I'm about say in my video whether we called them Proto indo-europeans which we made up nobody called themselves that so what's the difference

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.360
between that and palasan you know what I mean I guess Arian is like a real people

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:57.960
did call themselves arens people call themselves mes too I mean like what I'm basically getting as I'm saying these

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:05.600
people all came from this Black Sea region in between the black and Caspian Sea the step area this is where it all

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:12.840
begins this by the way right there is where the cultivation of the vine is discovered where wine is discovered so

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:20.719
this is dionan to its core this is why you find all these Di and there's so many gods like dianis

01:14:20.719 --> 01:14:26.159
that are like the cians have so many different tribes right this is this is

01:14:26.159 --> 01:14:31.920
like getting really micro into this and they all have these different names for these Gods but they're their functions

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:38.920
you can see them oh that's Zeus papos papos that's Zeus oh he's a sky father

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:44.560
oh there's another God um goddess the Earth goddess oh that's like Gaia they

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:51.400
all and you can see there's a connection going on and then you see this God he's the vine Bearer and he's like he's like

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:57.719
uh the moisture gives gives growth to the crops he's the he's he's the vegetation dying and Rising God the son

01:14:57.719 --> 01:15:04.480
of the son of the sky father you're like there's just so much lining up in all these different cultures and you know

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.560
kyl young gives it the word archetype fine I guess that's cool but I'm just

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:15.600
saying even if it's just an he he's trying to get it it's all like in the in these are archetypes that come from our

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:21.000
minds but I'm saying it's even simpler than that these people all descended

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:28.080
from a common ancestry by the way this is mind-blowing too drugs ancient drugs

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:33.719
is at the center of all this stuff because the words for holy the words for

01:15:33.719 --> 01:15:39.239
God when you find out that they're that if you look at the Indians

01:15:39.239 --> 01:15:45.960
the Sanskrit you compare it to the Germanic and you compare it to the avestan stuff that's in Persia and then

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:52.239
you find that these words are a little bit tweaked ha Som go which means which

01:15:52.239 --> 01:15:58.840
is the word for God the word god comes from the word Dr drug Som so you're talking about being the

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:05.280
word god itself has a connection to the ancient drugs to the Som yeah in that

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:11.360
little bit that I just showed from diores um they call it right they're

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:19.080
calling it The Dionysus the the dyam right they're using his title and saying the drug is

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:25.199
him this this equation that's why the Greeks come up with the concept of entho

01:16:25.199 --> 01:16:31.239
is right to have the god inside of you how do you get the god inside of you

01:16:31.239 --> 01:16:38.480
right through the plant that's how that's the Avenue that's the Avenue by the way everybody root the root Cutters

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:44.880
are the priestesses why are they called root Cutters Prest be call the root cutter what is she doing with root because

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:52.600
they're making because what do you think I mean DMT what do you think the the number one way to get is from Roots did

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:58.440
you know that I bet you bet you a lot of SP Scholars don't know that DMT the H

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:04.960
there there a toad that's the H and they're very rare you're not going to you're not going to buy the toad in the mail you have to go and find one

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:10.239
somewhere which is very uh logistic wise it doesn't make sense but these roots

01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:16.880
are everywhere acacia trees mimosa trees The Roots you cut the roots up you blend

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:23.000
it in some water you you soak out the the juices you mix it you there's a whole process I I could tell you it but

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.239
I'm not going to do it here there's a whole process process where you can get iasa or

01:17:28.239 --> 01:17:33.360
DMT from Roots so these root Cutters were figuring this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out way before

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:40.239
we did and this is at the this at the center of religion itself that's why I'm like when when I when a religious

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:45.639
scholar doesn't thinks this is crazy or you're out there man what the hell man

01:17:45.639 --> 01:17:51.199
this is I don't this is crazy no you don't know what you're talking about this is at the center of

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:59.600
it all because the you look at these ancient texts Som ha and go kakan kukan

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.760
these are all these and this is every this is the the center of the mystery

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:10.280
this is the initiation this is the most important aspect of the religion and

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:17.480
then you have in Christianity you have a Eucharist you don't think there's a connection there I think you need to do some more reading to be

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:22.639
honest totally I think you need to do some more reading I'm going to quote you

01:18:22.639 --> 01:18:29.880
and next time I get one of these biblical script that the classes just laugh at because they're so bad um I'm

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:35.480
going to say you need to listen to Neil from Gnostic informant man and um go

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:42.360
there you know what I mean uh Neil I love it and I love the fact by the way um don't I know I know you may have

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:49.760
already included it in your video um but remember that media in ca's media is

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:56.760
using palasan and in her chance and he even said says that in the text cica says

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:02.840
that in the text why would cica be so interested in that because the Caesars

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:11.120
in their libraries um were always interested in the palasan connection with the atrans

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:17.000
right and um which we know linguistically is probably there because

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:25.639
of what they said that they're Trojan blood because anas founded the city of Latium the the Trojans are part of that

01:19:25.639 --> 01:19:33.320
one of the palasan tribes right so they they figured it out and by the way and they've invent this I don't know how

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:38.679
they knew this but it turns out the italic people are closely connected to

01:19:38.679 --> 01:19:44.679
the people from the Black Sea region they are they had that same I don't know how you Hao Group whatever I don't know

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:51.080
it's the same it's the same language types and the same uh genetic types as people from that region so they migrated

01:19:51.080 --> 01:20:00.719
West into Italy at some point some point during the maybe or even the end of the Stone Age yeah the tsoi baby tsoi and

01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:07.960
the connection remember Cersei she's lives off the coast of Italy they kicked her out because of what she was trying

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:15.600
to do power-wise so that connection between the black seat these are priestesses of the kenes man these are

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.840
priestesses of that area now that they're fighting over um that they're

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:28.440
trying to take back from Russia right we were talking we were talking about uh media being from the eastern coast of

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:33.960
the Black Sea the in culus right yeah and the mes who who have become the most

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:40.920
powerful Dynasty in the world yeah the the the Persian Empire that's a Meade Empire they're they're found by people

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:46.760
who are median mes and the mes it says in Herodotus and in diodorus the mes

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:52.199
formerly were called Aryans and they changed their name to sound to be of

01:20:52.199 --> 01:20:58.080
media yeah mes means media like they're related to Media they're the sons of

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:04.920
media and by by the way in pontis this rich rich country pops up in the third

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:10.679
2nd Century bcee this Kingdom of pontis and it's cop

01:21:10.679 --> 01:21:16.320
the capital and you have mithradates the sixth the poison king and you know what

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:22.679
he says by the way there's a story about his birth where three Magi come and visit him and there's a star there's a

01:21:22.679 --> 01:21:28.719
it's really really eerily similar to Christianity's birth scene but guess what it also

01:21:28.719 --> 01:21:35.040
says that he's descended from both Alexander the Great and Cyrus the Great

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:40.679
making him the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] king of the world like this is like a but everybody was obsessed with genetics back then

01:21:40.679 --> 01:21:49.520
everybody Caesar has Venus's blood and this person is a related to this per well this is like no way you have a king

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:55.120
who's born from Alexander the Great and Cyrus the Great he's the Great of all

01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:01.800
time so he rises up becomes a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they said that all the wealth he had if you convert it into dollars it'd be like

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:07.360
past the trillions be like uncountable how much how much wealth he had

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:14.840
he he also had the he also had the thec that was meant to balance the communion

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:20.239
um from the Dark Harbor and writes about it right we have the um we have Roman

01:22:20.239 --> 01:22:27.679
here's a Roman physician who wrote about it and he said by the way the the real thing that you need to do with toxicon

01:22:27.679 --> 01:22:35.280
is you need to take the mithraic remedy he said that will balance it and I thought wow look at that it's I mean the

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:41.360
tech there is fantastic right you're developing Bronze Age stuff funneling it

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:48.760
through all that scientific advancement of um Hellenism and boom right and

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:55.560
people think well the Black Sea that's helenismo d

01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:02.040
right even the L they're worshiping Diana so oh my God I love it um um so

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:07.239
when is this video gonna come out I would say probably by the end of next

01:23:07.239 --> 01:23:16.000
week okay okay look at how much work that is can you just say something about that how much work do you put into one

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.360
of these videos all day this is what I do all day long when you add up your

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:27.120
script writing only time I leave the house to go to the gym sometimes every other day maybe you know not every

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:33.920
day every other day go to the gym so I don't get like because I I was when I first started doing YouTube

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:39.280
full-time I was working at a factory and I left the factory and I was in pretty decent shape back then from standing up

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:44.320
all day and moving tires around and then I started sitting around editing videos

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:50.199
all day never leaving the house and then I G gained a bunch of weight so now I'm like figuring out okay now I gotta I

01:23:50.199 --> 01:23:57.760
gotta do something I gotta get out of the house and work out and touch grass a little bit which I've been doing you

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:04.280
know Neil is transforming into Hercules as we sit

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:10.080
here and watch he is becoming Hercules and I know I know that he knows that's a

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:16.600
lot deeper than me just making jokes right and he has a lot more respect for that but I am fully expecting Neil

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:23.040
someday for um look if when like I said when the stuff happens I need you in the

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:30.719
boat right we need to work together because I'm going to need you as Hercules um and I think it's fantastic I

01:24:30.719 --> 01:24:36.320
think it's fantastic that you're not only building that muscle but with your

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:41.520
scholarship brao you're killing people right you're killing we're we're slaying

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:48.800
I know you don't I know you don't want my amateur scholarship is poison

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:54.600
arrows yeah yeah exactly Herculean exactly right I know you don't want me

01:24:54.600 --> 01:25:00.520
to say it but you just mounted Dan mullen's backside on your wall you did

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:07.080
you took him you took him down he's got nothing he can't stand he doesn't he I'll bet you I'm willing to bet he

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:12.280
doesn't even know how to track your sources I'll bet he wouldn't even

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:19.719
understand how to prove you wrong or right and the funny thing is if you bothered to get into those sources to

01:25:19.719 --> 01:25:26.719
try to prove you wrong you would see exactly what you're saying CU your video was just you presenting sources I love

01:25:26.719 --> 01:25:33.440
it I love it baby last thing I want to say before we go on to my my thing do you really think it's a coincidence that

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:40.040
the dionan Epiphany was celebrated on the same day as the Christian Epiphany

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:46.520
which was the same day as the Dua Epiphany which is the same day as the ion Epiphany all of them are sub on

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:53.000
January 6 what no way dude you're you're crazy the people think this is just a

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.360
coincidence what are you talking about that's a miracle there's no way there's

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:04.119
there's something culturally happening within Christianity as well as all these other Cults in the Eastern Realms of the

01:26:04.119 --> 01:26:09.400
Roman Empire and they're connected and people Christians Christian Scholars don't want to admit this they want to

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:15.560
think Christianity is like this offshoot of Judaism perfectly pure and even though it presents itself as anti it

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:21.880
presents itself as anti-pagan of course I'm soort of the platonist so a lot of people a lot of people pretend to be

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:29.520
anti-pagan but still bow from pagans this is like a normal thing at that time period yeah so all right all right Neil

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:35.840
hit it you were going to present something I'm gon I'm going to disappear for a few minutes everybody here is Neil

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:41.239
all right so I got a screen on the bottom that I want to present so the word adopt

01:26:41.239 --> 01:26:46.800
adamus it's means indestructible right now Parmenides uses this word to

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:52.560
describe the four elements in his in his on nature which

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:58.840
is interesting because he talks about God creating the cosmos using four

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:04.679
elements and you almost it's almost right off the bat my Spidey senses go tingling because I'm looking at that

01:27:04.679 --> 01:27:10.600
thing of the Genesis and God creating Adam and taking his rib off and creating

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:16.880
Ewa right so I'm like okay that's just a hypothesis at this time so I just put

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:24.960
that aside for a little bit um by the way adamus or Adam is very

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:30.920
closely looked very closely related to Hadis or Hades or spelled with the

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:37.000
aspirated a ades so you're looking at two names that start with ad whenever

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:46.040
you see something like that you should kind of go well let's look into this you got ad Adis and and the Cory who's

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:51.800
called Ewa this is a thing the prapan two titles well she has a lot of titles

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:57.199
but one of them is Ewa and she gets stuck in

01:27:57.199 --> 01:28:04.840
Hades for eating the paling Granite almost in a mirror image sense analogous

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:12.920
to Eve getting cast out of paradise for eating a fruit by the way the consensus

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:18.320
right now is that it wasn't an apple it was a p and granate most people think

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:25.760
that's what it was it's hard to prove this but most Scholars think this was a ping granate that Eve eight

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:31.360
anyways um I have a pull put that Source back up if you don't mind so the next

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.158
thing I want to show

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.840
is whoops sorry about that all right let me I clicked on instead of instead of

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:57.280
the I clicked on my screen to to share all right so I got that screen back up now all right sorry about that all right

01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:03.040
now the next thing I want to go to is Plato all right play talks about this

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:09.440
and is tus you can tell it's very parmenidean he's very he's very well

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:14.480
being uh influenced by parmin or um and pedicles I'm sorry imp

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:21.000
pedicles um or both of them the both of them talk about the elements right and

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:27.000
pedicles is first actually I think anyway it doesn't matter play is writing about these elements see you could see

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:33.440
the top the four kinds and he's talking about the Demi urge creating the universe he calls the

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:39.639
cosmos right so yeah I'm not going to read all this this is a lot but I just want to highlight some things that he

01:29:39.639 --> 01:29:44.760
talks about when he's talking about the Demi urge creating the cosmos with four

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:52.159
elements so he says it right here he says um well you just saw the four kinds

01:29:52.159 --> 01:29:57.560
um talks about fire earth water and air solid bodies and

01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:07.360
form a body huh that's interesting form a body by the way um he also talks about

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:14.480
in this same text I don't have it in front of me you can look this up for yourself fact check me please do that always check what I'm saying in this

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:20.320
same exact text I don't know if it's before this or after but at some point he talks about the different races of

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:29.320
humans that are made from these elements there's the gold golden race the silver race the bronze race and so forth and

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:34.360
um it makes you think like because well

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:39.600
well I'm I'm already trying to compare it to Genesis and thinking like you have

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:46.360
this indestructible Adam who lives for like thousands of years or whatever hundreds of years 900 years or whatever

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:51.840
and um he's the first Adam and Jesus is the last second Adam right so you have

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:57.760
like a new creation thing going on but let me put that side let me put that uh let me jump ahead on this real quick I

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:03.320
just want to show one more thing so he talks about he uses this word to describe the

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:12.360
elements Adam adamant which means indestructible he's talking about the

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:17.880
indestructible mixture of these elements he calls it an offshoot of gold which is

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:25.280
very hard because of its density and black in color is called adamant so he uses this the same

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:32.840
word which which and you're all all probably wondering why doesn't us to say Adam why is there more letters and you

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:37.920
know Greek is like that but there's a I think there's a better reason for why they shorten this to Adam and I'll get

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:43.199
to that in a second um but he says and the kind which closely resembles gold in

01:31:43.199 --> 01:31:49.000
its particles but has more forms than one and the density is more dense than gold and partakes of small and fine

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.239
portions of Earth so that it is harder while it is also lighter owing it's uh

01:31:54.239 --> 01:32:00.480
having large interstices what is that interstices within it this particular

01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:06.080
kind of the bright and solid Waters being compounded thus is termed

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:14.679
bronze and this is talking about the bronze race this is talk he's talking about Mortals being created you get it

01:32:14.679 --> 01:32:20.480
in the portion of earth that is mixed by the way there is that Earth remember everyone says Adam means Earth see it

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:26.000
now the portion of earth that is mixed there with becomes distinct by itself

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.760
and both grow old and separate each again each form the other and then it is

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:38.679
named rust that's like the lowest level rust all right that's just I'm

01:32:38.679 --> 01:32:45.080
just throwing hypothesis out there right now now I want to show you something from the cilene oracles because I've

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:50.280
always I've always said this cilene oracles reveals a lot of these Mysteries

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:56.480
they tell a lot of this stuff like when you want to look you want to know the origins of Christianity read the siine

01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:03.080
oracles CU there cuz what you're getting in the siine oracles is you're getting people who are not they don't care

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:09.320
they're not like team Judaism or team paganism or team this these are people within mystery religions that are doing

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:17.600
mixing all this stuff sort of like what you get in the Greek magical papy but these are simp these are Roman texts um

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:24.800
written for the Priestly class in the Romans this is like high level secret stuff like not every body had cop not

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:30.480
everybody had uh access to these texts now if you um I think it's F1 to search right

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:39.400
whoops um I'm still here right okay good uh let me see if I search for

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:44.719
Adam check this out there's a connection with Hades with Adam right off the

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:51.719
bat it says which snatched the Dreadful men away from life and Hades then received

01:33:51.719 --> 01:33:57.840
them it was called hates since Adam having tasted death went

01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:05.360
first and Earth encompassed him around and therefore all men Bor born upon the

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:11.679
Earth are in abodes of Hades called to go whoa okay let's keep going what do

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:19.400
what else do they say about Adam um there's that word again they use it to describe the gates of Hades so you

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:26.639
got the instru indestructible Gates of Hades they're using that same word indestructible right all right here's

01:34:26.639 --> 01:34:34.040
where things get wild in my opinion because often in the cilene oracles it's not just here it's other places too this

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:40.920
is such a weird title can you guys see the screen right now where it's where I have it highlighted um maybe I can zoom

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:49.600
in a little bit let's see if I can do that yeah there we go let's do this okay

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:57.480
is that better okay that's better this is The God Who formed four-lettered Adam

01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:04.320
the first one formed and filling his with his name east west south and north

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:09.840
the same as he who fixed the pattern of the human form and made wild beasts now

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:16.520
this is a really odd esoteric passage in my opinion four what who who do you know

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:22.520
that's ever called four lettered anything my name my name is four-lettered NE a l nobody he calls me

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:30.520
four-lettered Neil what a weird title to give somebody four-lettered well what if Adam being

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:35.600
four letters is something to do with the four elements the four and this is like

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:41.159
they're tetr it's like a tatag Graton like yaho gets extended to Yahweh

01:35:41.159 --> 01:35:46.440
because you know the oldest fragments of Yahweh it's three letters all of a sudden it gets four letters it's this

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:51.840
weird thing going on with numbers I don't know what it is I'm still still researching this it's still in my

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:59.040
hypothesis zone right now but I just want to throw this at you the the idea that he's called four-lettered Adam it's

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:06.000
like why is he called four-lettered Adam why isn't it just Adam or why isn't it something else because it signifies

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.400
something's going on there there's a reason why he's four letters and I'm thinking when we're looking at these

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:17.600
other texts that I showed you with adamus being the indestructible elements that the demiurge used to craft humans

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:22.880
with the Earth and this is why I think Adam becomes also called Earth because

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:28.920
there's a there's a connection here they're using the indestructible elements of the earth to create humans

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:35.239
with Adam being the first one all right now you're probably thinking this is a little wild let me get some more

01:36:35.239 --> 01:36:43.239
evidence for this sure I got one thing for you this is going to be cool all right I'm gonna share my screen one more

01:36:43.239 --> 01:36:48.520
time um let me see this

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:55.280
okay once you see it uh pop it up on the screen there we go this is the samian

01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:02.000
Mysteries now a lot of us know about this because we love that mystery religions so we're all thinking oh yeah

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:09.440
I love this by the way in the sources and in the archaeology these are the oldest of all this is like palas and

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:16.320
stuff by the way pans are were inhabited that region but they call themselves

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:22.400
palasan too um and they're identified with this island this secret Magical

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:29.119
Mystery religion Island where these sacred priests who held the oldest according to diodorus according to

01:37:29.119 --> 01:37:36.280
strabo according to Herodotus according to basically anyone that writes about samuth rians they're they're the the

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:42.520
oldest Priestly class of all they they're holding on to Mysteries that are so old they go back to like the Stone

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:49.520
Age right well let's look at this for a second what do they what do they got going on well they turns out that they

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:56.639
have a primordial hero called thas the spiritual

01:37:56.639 --> 01:38:02.960
person okay the nasen preacher identifies this

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:08.800
adamus with Adam and he also calls Jesus the second

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:14.480
adamus so you already have a connection going on with adamus by the way this

01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:21.920
name means indestructible here he's the indestructible hero that's the primordial God like demigod of the

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:28.239
Mysteries and so brief history of the mystery writes the rights went back to preg Greek thracian

01:38:28.239 --> 01:38:36.159
palasan inhabitants of the samans this is why the priests of the rights Preserve in their liturgies preg Greek

01:38:36.159 --> 01:38:43.119
thracian words this is why my video is so much on thians are the I love the Thracians I can't wait to tell you guys

01:38:43.119 --> 01:38:49.480
about the Thracians they are the best they are the best I'm starting to almost like them more than the Greeks sorry I

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:55.239
know that's Blas for me to some of you the thians are the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] best I'm sorry I have to say it and by the way

01:38:55.239 --> 01:39:03.800
the Greeks would say that too the Greeks love the thians all the religion in Athens is all thian [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] imported uh the

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:08.880
orus was a thran bar got you know what I'm saying you get it um dionis is all

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:15.760
over th anyways um so you have this religion where that's pretty much it um okay

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:23.239
that's it um stop sharing so you have a a primordial demigod called adamus in

01:39:23.239 --> 01:39:29.760
the oldest mystery religion that's way older than Judaism or Christianity before there even thought on the on the

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:37.560
radar because they're all polytheist in in Judea at this time they're not there's no Judaism yet it's a way that's

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:43.199
a helenistic thing and maybe Persian thing but in the sources it's a

01:39:43.199 --> 01:39:49.520
helenistic thing there's no synagogue till 200 BCE not one so I'm just saying

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:55.040
like this is stuff that predates Genesis and

01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:03.719
now by the way there's other words for man in Hebrew it's not Adam Adam is a is a is a

01:40:03.719 --> 01:40:09.920
secondary term they don't say hey that Adam over there get him over here they said there's another word they use I

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:17.000
can't think of it right now uh it is I think it's

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:25.000
ish I should know that but I just forgot you're right yeah now now

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:31.880
can can you imagine Neil can you imagine now the the person who stepped up and

01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:38.320
who is having to compose the Torah right in Greek right they're making this text

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:43.840
and they're trying to establish their own tradition that'll give them the

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:51.599
legitimacy that they need and what are they doing they're look at what you've done with Adam right they're borrowing

01:40:51.599 --> 01:40:57.000
from the Greek tradition and trying to claim it right they're trying to to be

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:04.599
able to say okay it's appropriation right and they of course they have to because they're buried in Alexandria

01:41:04.599 --> 01:41:12.080
with the with the boohemoth that is the Greek um tradition of history and drama

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:18.320
all sorts of lyric poetry they're buried by that so you can see that whoever

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:26.800
wrote it was trying to justify or create a culture right so um yeah we see that I

01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:33.719
love the fact that what you're doing is you're looking at it from those texts and where they are in history it's it's

01:41:33.719 --> 01:41:39.280
brilliant and you know nobody I know that this is a war baby for this

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:44.400
knowledge and nobody can stand against you when you just pull out those sources

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:49.440
like that I love it man I love it um congratulations on doing such a great

01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:56.040
job I do want to ask you about your presentation I want to ask you um what was that I saw about you flashed it off

01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:02.840
the screen real quick um you don't bring it back but it was something about erections with Adam something about

01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:08.599
Adam's erection um do you think it's it's strange that they would be focusing

01:42:08.599 --> 01:42:13.800
on it or isn't that just you know in the temples you know to the Muse we've got a

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:20.320
giant erect phus there right um that's part of the deal do they are you saying

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:26.119
that these people had their own Hermes and do you think those those statues of

01:42:26.119 --> 01:42:33.800
Hermes with the erections on them that we see all over the roads right they're like mile markers right you've got a

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:40.840
Hermes there with a big erection that's what they are they're directionals for people because that they don't have GPS

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:47.280
you're not walking with a map in your hand because yeah it's it's you know what I mean so you walk around these Ro

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:54.320
follow the erections follow the FIS points to the way yeah yeah fantastic oh

01:42:54.320 --> 01:43:04.360
I love it I love it okay I'm gonna give you the last word priapus is called The Good the agathos the good di AOS diamont

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:10.119
so love it God isn't that good people look what

01:43:10.119 --> 01:43:16.920
look what okay I'm going to end it there because that was pure dessert right you can see that privacy wait but Neil I do

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:23.480
want to ask you you went you went to the Met yeah right and you saw the room with

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:28.960
all the Prius stuff just can you tell people one minute on that just there's

01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:36.520
hundreds of thousands of these things not I'm not joking hundreds of thousands of these Prius statues that Greeks and

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:42.800
Romans and Egyptians and syrians all would put on their houses on their like

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:50.800
garden gnomes and these were because Prius is a symbol the phus and well PR

01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:58.639
if you talk read about Prius in the orphic HS he's he's the last of the generation

01:43:58.639 --> 01:44:05.159
from fies the uncreated one so sometimes the names hyphenated phies priapus

01:44:05.159 --> 01:44:10.800
they're all one line of gods going from phies all the way through to dionisis

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:15.880
and then dianis and Aphrodite the two

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:21.800
most sacred gods and goddess of the Mysteries

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:28.560
dionisis and a Venus and bakus that's Lucifer baby that's the Morning Star you can't get a

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:35.080
better Union than that and they birth Prius priapus is the holy child of Venus

01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:42.400
