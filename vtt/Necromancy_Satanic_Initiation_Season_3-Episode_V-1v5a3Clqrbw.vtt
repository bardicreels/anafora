conscious and with my concoctions preserve the germinal semen of Life

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:52.800
established in the Flames of Desire thank you Seneca thank you Seneca that

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.920
should get us in the right place there's a good reason ancient witches became experts in the use of sexual

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:07.080
drugs they understood that the manipulation of sexuality was a means of Transport from

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.500
the mundane to the magical ancient philosopher studied logic

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:20.160
mathematics and natural science in pursuit of personal Enlightenment clerics read signs of the sky and

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.980
prognosticated on their oracular significance in order to avert disaster

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:32.220
and to honor the Gods Statesmen pursued oratory and law in

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:39.959
order to perpetuate the Machinery of ancient governance and as equally valued members of ancient

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:45.000
Society Greco-Roman witches studied the Ecstasy

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.080
of sexuality in order to resurrect a bigendered Creator a gyneamorphic God

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:58.860
who was the key to unlocking a multi-dimensional universe

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:05.459
foreign for the young Priestess who serve Gods

00:10:05.459 --> 00:10:09.800
such as Hecate priapus and Dionysus

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:18.779
the secrets of the natural world were not just for the theoretical musings of natural scientists these educated women

00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:24.959
took an active approach to the cosmos by advancing the notion that the world around them

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:30.360
particularly the human body could be actively manipulated they believed they

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:39.600
were not just Spectators of a cosmic dream but active participants in the progress of the universe's drama

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:48.000
ancient witches were part of a long religion and religious and medical tradition that predates written history

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.700
they were a bridge between the shaman of early human civilization and the

00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:00.120
philosopher of the classical era the earliest written records of Greek Roman

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:07.920
and Etruscan civilization are replete with drugs and Drug recipes used by

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.200
priestesses and witches The Witch's understanding of drugs

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:19.560
predates the written word even the palace records of the Minoans and

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.680
Mycenaeans the earliest ancestors of the Greeks to leave written documents they

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:32.660
show an awareness of the use of Botanicals as drugs

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:40.740
it's old you go through this old Linear B and a lot of lists you get a list for

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:47.519
the drugs that they're trading it's right there it's gorgeous you can tell what they're doing right you can tell

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:54.480
what they're doing by the drugs uh have you been to Cyprus did you get the Smyrna you know what

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.579
that stuff smells like oh God I can't do this

00:11:59.579 --> 00:12:08.100
I can't do this it gets to me just sitting here it gets to me witches were never passive they actively

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:13.740
engaged their disciplined subject matter in order to advance their cause with a

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:20.399
clear unified agenda and laborious training in their Arts ancient which is claimed to be able to harness the power

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:26.279
of the natural world to perform Supernatural Feats their miracles were

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:33.420
based in the reality of sexuality as the witch canadius said in horus's epodes

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:42.300
with my own voice I am able to draw down the Moon I can arouse the dead once cremated I

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:50.160
can concoct drugs of sexual desire I can bring that

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:57.240
they can bring that individual back they can bring that individual back

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:04.440
even after they've been their bodies consumed fantastic love this

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:10.440
they can also make the sex drugs yeah fantastic

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:16.380
makes you wonder about Mary Magdalene doesn't it that Pope

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:24.019
cares that she has sex drugs really she needs to be pardoned Pope Greg the Great

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.600
you guys are hilarious the Watchers they always know the best places in the universe

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.639
which has accomplished The Impossible by manipulating the mundane they secured

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:40.740
their environments for uh for the tools necessary they scoured excuse me they

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:47.220
scoured their environments for the tools necessary to alter the natural world and they use the act of human sexual

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:52.500
intercourse as a springboard to affect their Supernatural tinkering it's fair

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:59.100
to say that the heart of ancient witchcraft was sexuality there's a good reason that so many ancient spells are

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:04.920
concerned with intercourse which is belief sex was the cosmic magic that

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:12.420
gave them their power drugs let's talk about drugs

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:19.200
the desire to bend nature LED priestesses of hecatee priapus and

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:26.100
Dionysus to the use of potent plant and animal substances these chemicals had

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.259
dramatic effects on human physiology

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:39.779
powdered aconite was Lethal in very small doses opium latex from the poppy

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:47.820

that's how they that's how they expressed it in antiquity yeah you get chilled

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.980
one of the drugs used in Antiquity that is entirely escaped the radar of modern

Scholars is snake venom Venom is a various Snake species

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:59.760
produce a Venom that affects the ability of blood to coagulate as Predators these

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:05.039
snakes use hemorrhagic Venoms to kill prey but the complex protein toxins they

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:10.440
employ may also help prepare their food sources for digestion

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:17.640
Venom glands and reptiles just evolutionarily develops saliva glands after all and the poisons these

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.799
synthesize they synthesize their physiological active when injected

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:28.380
directly into the bloodstream they recognize this you can't eat these things

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:33.900
right that's why you have to have the anal applicator

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:39.720
did you ever wonder why that Priestess walks around with a dildo

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:46.440
yeah yeah that's her wand that's your wand

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:52.020
sometimes they tie you down I don't know it gets questionable there

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:58.080
right several popular mystery religions of Greece and Rome relied heavily on the

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:05.580
use of vipers during the celebrations and the iconography of this particular reptile regularly intrudes into the

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:14.100
literature with our an artistic representations of these same cults within the practices of

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:21.480
these Cults vipers typically appear in the context of oracular transformation that is the Vipers are represented as

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:28.799
agents of maniacal metamorphosis they enable mystery initiates to assume the

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:35.880
madness characteristic of gynomorphic Gods like Dionysus

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:42.900
other snake species also creep into mythological references in very specific ways that reflect the ancient world's

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:50.039
fascination with gender switching and sexual manipulation

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:55.380
remember these witches right and they're developing these dotes

00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:04.140
and antidotes and they are focusing upon sexual reproduction right within the big tent

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:10.940
of Midwifery or gynecology oh think of that those of you who are

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:16.760
evangelicals hold your ears those of you who are in Tennessee

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:22.980
Texas shout out to you guys open up your ears for a minute and

listen listen to the fetus being bathed in the Venom

00:22:28.919 --> 00:22:34.020
yeah yeah genetic medicine

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:39.980
right for the biochemists out there who know

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:47.159
what those toxins are capable of and how they interact with human hormones

00:22:47.159 --> 00:22:53.100
yeah um we've got glorious stuff there glorious potential there's potential for

00:22:53.100 --> 00:23:01.559
a whole new form of Medicine yeah I'm gonna ah I'm gonna have a guest on the lady

medicine maybe he'll take us to that that spring that I was telling you about

00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:22.020
in the middle of your brain oh God it's the Water of Life baby

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.600
stars priestesses and sorceresses I've got a little extra time tonight so just

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:33.840
well hang on there um if you don't mind priestesses and sorceresses who pioneered the use of

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:39.980
snake Venoms for the regulation of menstruation foreign

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:45.780
believed in a universe composed of various overlapping planes the ancient

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:51.120
witch's Cosmos is strikingly similar to the Multiverse of modern cosmologists

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:56.940
who study astrophysics which is like Medea Cersei and Canadia believe that

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:02.820
the Universe was divided into three Realms these dimension-like Realms were

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:09.659
given the names Earth Olympus and Erebus according to Greek accounts of the

00:24:09.659 --> 00:24:17.220
origins of the universe the three Realms of existence all possess basic elements and unique inhabitants Earth was

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:22.919
believed to be the realm of air the element consumed by Mortals Olympus was

00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:30.419
a plane inhabited by gods who breathe ether and Erebus was a realm of demonic

00:24:30.419 --> 00:24:37.320
powers these Powers breathe and ingest

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:42.419
dark matter yes that's what they called it that's

00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:50.220
not the name that I just made up they called it dark matter cool the Greco-Roman Realms of existence

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:57.059
are very much like overlapping dimensions of reality the inhabitants of each realm are invisible to the other

00:24:57.059 --> 00:25:03.919
Realms but can communicate and interact under specific controlled circumstances

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:10.080
witches were most interested in the interactions of Erebus the underworld

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:16.799
with the world of Earthly Mortals that's what they specialized in the

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:22.200
connection of those two realms okay ancient mythographers recorded

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:30.380
Traditions that the gods of Erebus could only visit Earth by Sat by accessing portals or gateways through collapsed

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:35.700
Stars this dark star is picked up across

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:41.159
time um by lots of

00:25:41.159 --> 00:25:47.520
not so friendly groups and the process of working through a

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:53.159
darkened star is Central to the work of the Sorceress

00:25:53.159 --> 00:26:01.679
you have to capture that wave of space-time distortion that those collapsed Stars

00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:08.520
produce okay totally it's too much physics Poindexter

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:14.460
I know I have a hard time too those witches were smart you know you gotta you gotta be a mental

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.919
gymnast just to keep up with them it's amazing

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:29.039
due to the fact that these Immortal beings and infertile demons breached

00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:36.840
breathed Darkness or dark matter it was necessary to remove or destroy light sources in

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:43.260
order to sanction or sorry to sustain their travel poets like claudian of the

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:48.840
late 4th century taught that the dark matter of Erebus

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:58.260
neither reflected nor absorbed light and thus was incompatible with the Earth

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:05.360
realm where light is abundant when the gods of Erebus visited Earth

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:11.640
they were forced to remain within Dark Matter bubbles that's cool what he

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:17.760
mentions yeah it's a bubble of dark matter in order to sustain themselves

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:23.580
um uh for the transit yeah so dark matter bubbles

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:28.620
this is what we get rights of Apollo that use this right these oracular

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:35.039
practices Under World gateways the power to draw down the stars in

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:41.880
order to open gateways to the underworld became the purview of witches by employing poisons that contain the power

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:47.760
to manipulate the basic elements of the cosmos these witches believed they were

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:55.200
able to enable the gods of the underworld to access the Earth Realm the

00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:02.039
element manipulating powers of their drugs manifest themselves by alterations

00:28:02.039 --> 00:28:07.559
in sexuality okay quantum

00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:14.480
which witches viewed as alterations of the generative power of their

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:20.100
by-gendered goddess their folk they're drawing the

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:26.700
generative power of their goddess you see how this goes back to the you know why Paul the Apostle is walking around

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:33.179
saying you worship nature of course they do you idiot

00:28:33.179 --> 00:28:38.340
yeah Paul was not the smartest knife in the drawer you know what I mean

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:43.919
the power to draw down the stars in order to open gateways The Honorable became the purview of the witches

00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:51.020
the element manipulating powers of their drugs manifested themselves by alterations and sexuality

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:58.740
their drugs could sexually inflame their victims or stifle their arousal with the

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:05.580
force of cold chill as in seneca's Medea after she Medea called out every sort of

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:11.100
poisonous snake gathered together her cursed herbs she

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:16.380
picked the death dealing plants and milked the snakes of their venom and

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:23.159
mixed them the wild force of fire was in some the power of numbing Frost in

00:29:23.159 --> 00:29:29.100
others so this is a good example of our polypharmacy sorry there's a good

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:34.380
example of our polypharmacy we're almost there to the conclusion and

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.659
I want you to see the did we are we gonna get cut for this somehow you think

00:29:39.659 --> 00:29:46.200
it's okay let's show the mother let's just take ourselves remember the movie that they programmed us with as children

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:54.600
I'm talking to my 40 to 60 demographic the movie they program us with with his

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:00.240
kids you didn't know that it was a giant drug trip did you hit it give us the

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:15.190
witch please please [Music]

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:26.039
please it's always some witch working a

00:30:26.039 --> 00:30:31.740
distance like that putting you to sleep with a bunch of poppies

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:37.980
my God man version was growing them uh virginal has a book that talks about

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:45.059
how to grow opium poppies why why is that Augustus was a

00:30:45.059 --> 00:30:52.559
dude Augustus was big into the Opium Marcus Aurelius yeah they were loving it

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:58.320
honestly why not [Music] was all legal can you imagine that a

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:04.860
society where all the drugs are legal the only ones that they made illegal and they have

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:11.700
laws against this and Cicero prosecuted somebody for this is if you use a drug

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:17.700
um to cause death you can't use a drug to cause death yeah

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:23.899
yeah so you know can be prosecuted as murder yeah

00:31:23.899 --> 00:31:28.980
the purpose of using these drugs was the attraction or liberation of Underworld

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:35.100
deities inner demons that is these witches believe the gods of the underworld were readily available for

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:43.260
the cons for consultation and interference in the activities of the Fates just like our witch right that we just

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:49.398
saw she's putting them to sleep from a distance perfect

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:56.520
bringing them up from the underworld was a prerequisite for forecasting the

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:02.399
future and you say oh wait what yes right look into the crystal ball baby

00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:07.980
and see the future Ah that's that Oracle sucking you in you

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:13.080
got the chilling or the burning right okay um

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:19.860
yes the purpose of using these drugs was the attraction or liberation of Underworld

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:25.559
divinities summoning the bigendered queen goddess of the witches was a

00:32:25.559 --> 00:32:30.840
necessary step in commanding the forces of the Underworld the realm where all

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.840
Mortals eventually end up this powerful goddess hackity and her

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:43.620
masculine manifestations were all guardians of gateways to Erebus which is

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:49.860
summoned hagate with sacrifice in order to access your power to open portals

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:56.779
remember Canadian we were telling you about the witch who was preparing her infernal sacrifice

00:32:56.779 --> 00:33:03.480
they would take boys oh God they would take little boys

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:09.419
um you can [Music]

00:33:09.419 --> 00:33:14.580
you can do a lot to extract

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:21.480
certain substances right if the witches have figured out which they've known since the Bronze Age that the human body

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:28.799
is a factory for chemicals chemicals that can be used

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:34.919
you know call them elements of the blood seeds of Fire

00:33:34.919 --> 00:33:40.019
yeah the seeds of fire all of a sudden the Evangelical turned on for a minute

00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:45.240
because he's like what yeah you start to smell the Christos don't you

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:51.240
yeah you do ah yeah where were we where we're controlling Administration right

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:56.760
we're bringing it down to drinking that blood

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:02.039
it's the blood of the sacrifice when you eject

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:07.559
that chemically aborted fetus with the drug the burning purple that

00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:14.220
you're using that is our communion those cells

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:20.339
in that concoction are the healing of the nation yeah

00:34:20.339 --> 00:34:26.520
isn't that great hmm now you know where you came from ancient priestesses and sorceresses

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:33.419
viewed the underworld as a realm or dimension of the universe accessible through Cosmic portals using their

00:34:33.419 --> 00:34:40.858
pharmacological crafts they claim the ability to open these portals for would-be travelers they don't care if

00:34:40.859 --> 00:34:47.520
you can see them or not and for those brave enough to consult

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:54.358
the dead wait a minute isn't Jehovah wait where's that Jehovah where are you

00:34:54.359 --> 00:35:01.020
are you here mighty mighty Jehovah of the highest where'd you go Jova he hates

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:07.260
this he hates this stuff right he's like don't you go consult these witches

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:13.200
please find my case right these users of drugs do you know why you shouldn't

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:20.940
consult them they can talk to the Dead and it turns out that it works right and

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:27.240
you bring this up bring this up in your church say wait a minute how is this stuff working and it says that they're

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:33.060
drug involving drugs right it's because you as a Christian are not practicing

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:39.000
Christianity I don't care if you're a Catholic or a Protestant I don't care

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.339
you are phonies phonies

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:53.220
and how do I say that because I've seen I've seen how the early church practiced

00:35:53.220 --> 00:36:00.960
and you are nothing of a mystery you are a fragment of a jaded past

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:08.160
your faith is not the operation of Mystery it never was

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:14.460
yeah you gotta go back to your text people evangelicals where are you in there go

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:21.300
back go back to your text and look at them look at your tags yeah that's what

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:27.000
they need to do which of indoor yeah love it Elijah's

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.180
doing that stuff too Elijah's into the drugs bro now he can bring the fire of Uranus

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:39.240
yeah he's he knows what the purple is that

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:45.480
have you been talking I'm talking monkeys right it's not at all difficult

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:52.680
to see why the Bishops of the early Christian Church move the Roman Emperor to declare the activity of witches to be

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:59.160
illegal and prosecutable by execution they're not going to execute Twisted Sister are

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:06.960
they Twisted Sister We're Not Gonna Take It to the great Twisted Sister

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:13.079
let us not take it yes let us not take it the sexual magic

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:19.619
of Greco-Roman which is presented an impediment to the spread of Christian

00:37:19.619 --> 00:37:25.920
mystery rights wait what an impediment to the spread of Christian

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:31.440
rights these openly condemned communication

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:36.780
with any of the underworld divinities Church fathers condemn the use of page

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:43.380
of pagan magic but they could not entirely Wipe Out the influence of witches on the Roman population

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:49.760
drugs used by witches to treat gynecological problems had become an important aspect of ancient medicine

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:55.920
just as they are today you see they're fighting about the same thing nothing

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:02.400
changes oh my it's beautiful isn't it the Watchers again let me just tell you

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:07.440
something Watchers they're like these humans man I know I know they call it

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:12.660
the dung Heap Dimension right they call it the dimension of the refuse the

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:18.119
prison some of them call it the prison and that's where we are in a giant prison

00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:25.619
this is your punishment yeah yeah this is your punishment

00:38:25.619 --> 00:38:32.339
keep them from their sexual magic when they put on the clothes of a woman

00:38:32.339 --> 00:38:39.359
a woman do you hear the disrespect a woman you know we all needed dinner we

00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:46.800
all need to put on a clothes of a woman yeah supporting our Twisted Sister drugs used

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:52.680
by witches to treat gynecological problems have become an important aspect of ancient medicine killing off

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:59.700
individual witches did not put an end to their broad influence and practices sexuality and Magic

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:08.099
were intimately tied together through the use of pharmaceuticals by doctors and midwives Christianity tried in vain

00:39:08.099 --> 00:39:13.140
