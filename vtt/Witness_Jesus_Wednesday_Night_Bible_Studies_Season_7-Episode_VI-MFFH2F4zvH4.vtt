the he gives them what it takes to cast out right these bad spirits to perform

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:32.880
look at the last word a on look at that the a

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:38.760
cathartic right this is purification what is Jesus Jesus what are you

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:48.000
teaching your disciples to purify to purify and um okay so this is

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:56.440
known necromancy right known necromancy yes okay fine and these cathartic rights

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:02.600
these are pretty much oh there's been a thousand years of them

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:08.399
up until this point you're not the first are you Jesus no no no he's not the

00:27:08.399 --> 00:27:14.039
first as a matter of fact he's he's on the scene quite late quite late yeah

00:27:14.039 --> 00:27:20.960
this Magi next one yeah and what happens um he the the

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:26.159
he's going to teaches people right right he they're going to cast out they cast

00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:33.320
out a lot of demons a lot of demons they cast them out because these are cathartic riots right and what did they

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:40.519
do they went around touching people with oil baby just touch oily oily oily oily

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:47.159
give you some oil and given therapy to the people who didn't feel so good right

00:27:47.159 --> 00:27:52.360
to the people who weren't quite right they made them right oiled them up in

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:59.519
the process these are the oil boys these are the oil boys

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:08.640
um think about that for a minute just step out historically as we sit here and look at Jesus he is sending teenagers

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:15.880
out to oil people and to cast out their

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:22.679
demons okay okay I just is that

00:28:22.679 --> 00:28:28.360
clear did everybody on the jury hear that we good okay okay let's go to the

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:36.519
next go to the next one please boom Mark 6:15 some people say Jesus that you're

00:28:36.519 --> 00:28:44.240
Elias right and um other people say that you're one of the prophets yeah yeah um

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:51.039
this is just the way it is this is just the way it is what is a prophet and the next question should be I want to pull

00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:57.960
up my question L Chey what is a prophet what is a prophet Jesus give us a

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:06.279
definition here oh oh people people look at this somebody ordered up Alice Alice

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:12.360
and Wonderland one who speaks for a God and interprets his will to men as in the

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:19.320
prophet of Zeus that's what that says in Greek Theos right Zeus and I'm an

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:25.919
interpreter and expounder of the will of Zeus for example tyresius oh you didn't know a prophet and everybody starts

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:31.240
panicking are you panicking now because a little bit of Hebrew propaganda from

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:38.360
Antiquity from pukes like Josephus and Pho has permeated your

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:44.039
brain over the centuries you got to clean that out have

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:51.080
you seen anything yet from the New Testament no you're looking at a Greek concept

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:58.080
guess what prophet is a Greek word it's a Greek word the concept

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:04.480
that the alexandrians who wrote the septu in the 3 Century the concept of

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:11.600
the Prophet having a vision guess what guess where that comes

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:18.200
from this tradition the Greek tradition is a thousand years before this already

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:23.919
established it's a Bronze Age thing prophets Bronze

00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:30.240
Age yeah they're already there in the earliest stuff and Homer Homer can you

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:35.120
believe Homer oh

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:42.600
calus love it what's a prophet let's keep looking at the definition of prophet because I want to introduce the

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:51.200
satanic congregation to what a a prophet is for the first time look at that second line right after terius it says

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:58.080
Baku prophetes right the prophet of bakus prophet of bakus perhaps of

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:06.320
orus yeah and dionis you know same same not no no differences there right um and

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:12.960
what else of Delia and Apollo you have prophets you didn't know the pyas were

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:19.519
prophetesses yeah did you know that by the time Jesus is walking around calling himself a prophet because that's what he

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:26.080
does Jesus when you say to a crowd of people why you can't do your mojo well

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:34.240
it's because a prophet Propet has no honor when he's at home okay all right

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:40.760
so what else is a prophet Jesus no we need that back what else is a prophet Jesus look at number two it's a title of

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:47.639
official keepers of oracles okay if you guys thought I was making this up don't you know that Jesus

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:56.720
is part of the oracular tradition he may be a pirate but he's part of the oracular tradition the Christ has to be

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:02.080
right why do you you think he's walking around saying he's a prophet I'm a prophet I'm a prophet let me

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:08.480
prophesy yep look at number three an interpreter

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:13.760
I like that of what what do you interpret the montis look at that Greek word

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:21.200
montis right montis what is the Mantic that's Apollo baby that's that Priestess

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:27.320
delie that's what she gets is that Mania are those from the same route they think

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:34.159
they are yeah man and montis who is a

00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:39.360
montis I know some praying

00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:01.240
I love it let's go to the next one number five an interpreter a declare um

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:08.120
number Roman numeral number two um a Herald sort of Herald now look look at

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:13.960
Roman numeral number three it

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:19.360
stinks of poop

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:25.600
intellectual religious spoop look what happened they don't know

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:31.399
how to fit your own your Christian tradition into the into the definition

00:33:31.399 --> 00:33:37.360
so what did one of the um editors that Liddell had for this what did he do what

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:44.480
did he do well look we gotta it's got to have its own definition for for the Bible when it's the Bible gets his own

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:50.080
definition you know that doesn't stand up to science because there's things

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:56.039
that are being written that are contemporary to the Bible right and the

00:33:56.039 --> 00:34:02.799
stuff that applies to to them applies to the Bible so let's blow this up to you let

00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:09.878

00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:57.880
ministration to flow right people didn't know take it down for a minute I forgot

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:06.359
to tell the audience I forgot to tell them I should have told you a long time ago um there are ways of drawing down

00:44:06.359 --> 00:44:12.240
ministration there are ways of working in concert with your cycle using plants

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:20.000
and animals right substances mixed together that for you can cause you a

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.319
catharsis can cause you a cleansing or a purging now you can sit there you can

00:44:26.319 --> 00:44:31.359
let your body do it itself or you can put your body back in touch with Gaia

00:44:31.359 --> 00:44:37.240
and let Gaia make you the most most healthy that's what this doctor is

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:44.920

you drink it he says when you give it with wine it's useful for those who were

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:37.040

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.880
muron it's going to be mixed with it so those sex drugs that the people on the

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:48.200
island of Cyprus are using in celebration of their mystery those are

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:56.040
here and they're used with the very same drugs that Jesus Christ was given and

00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:03.440
where do these things come from they come from pontis they come from friia they're Ayan they come from Italy too

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:13.319
right so they're very well aware Mediterranean Society take it down is very well aware of um exactly what these

00:47:13.319 --> 00:47:18.559
plants can do right and that knowledge is is incredible we have lost this

00:47:18.559 --> 00:47:26.359
knowledge in the last thousand years of Christianity we have lost this knowledge soon as Julian gave up the

00:47:26.359 --> 00:47:33.240
ghost right soon as he finished his quest everything went to the

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:40.680
Christians and just like he said as soon as they start teaching they were warp I saw somebody right in I didn't get this

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:46.359
comment um but I saw somebody write in last week and or maybe it was the week

00:47:46.359 --> 00:47:52.920
before and say something and about nus and say this is a text that is outside

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:59.960
the Bible the sacred nature of the Bible it's not that inspired it's not that

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:06.880
it's we're just not going to accept it we're going to cut the authority you know how the Christians set their Cannon by cutting out the things that scared

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:14.400
them right and the things they didn't want to teach they cut all those things out as a classicist you're trained you

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:23.119
can't take a body of literature and treat it any different from any other body of literature they are still human

00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:30.200
texts and we're not there to establish Doctrine I'm sorry ladies of frustration

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:37.040
but we are not there to establish a Doctrine we are there as scientists with

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:43.000
words we are philologists yeah and that's why you

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.559
always come up with a fairy tale and you and you give it to the people and those

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:54.920
people suck it up and I know you do because you bring it onto this channel you bring your narrative onto this

00:48:54.920 --> 00:49:01.799
channel remember what Sala said they're idiots they're

00:49:01.799 --> 00:49:07.920
illiterate if you consider yourself an intelligent uh well-educated literate

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:14.079
when I say literate what do I mean by literate I mean you know letters and you

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:21.480
read I don't mean you recognize the stop sign I mean literate and the early Christians

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:27.559
weren't and celsus was pointing it out he was pointing it out to them right

00:49:27.559 --> 00:49:35.119
notice what the Christians do they pick on those who don't have

00:49:35.119 --> 00:49:41.720
access yeah yeah an educated

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:47.200
Christian you doesn't exist in the world

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:52.640

says uneducated doesn't it doesn't it says they don't read was it on the

00:51:25.839 --> 00:51:32.480
skills test Jesus when you obviously weren't using Roman State Standards

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:37.559

00:51:43.839 --> 00:51:51.760
ask about your students where's the next slide what did people say about you oh here it is um what was our question here

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:58.839
um Jesus is saying anybody who receives a prophet right in the name of a prophet he gets the reward of a prophet he gets

00:51:58.839 --> 00:52:04.760
the wages of a prophet right he receives Justice in the name of Justice this dude

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:11.520

saying to you he's not going to lose his reward he's not going to lose his reward

00:52:40.599 --> 00:52:46.880
the one who rewards the prophet you know what Jesus was making he was making

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:52.640
prophets and you say well that kind of makes sense that he was doing it kind of you can feel the magic pass along even

he's calling them pidea again because he's a pervert right either that or he's weird

00:56:34.119 --> 00:56:39.520
feet okay let's go to the next one it's but you know it's the thing it's the way

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:44.559
they did it I want you to look at this article this is just a randomly plucked

00:56:44.559 --> 00:56:51.400
article from the bin of historic crappy how old were Christ's disciples here

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:56.799
they are Otis and Frank are going to figure it out for us I don't know know what they I don't know who they are I

00:56:56.799 --> 00:57:02.599
don't know if they're husband and wife um but I I do know this I do know this

00:57:02.599 --> 00:57:09.240
they wrote about the age of the disciples and they have a real problem take it down they have a real problem

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:15.400
because it looks like they're so young and every time they're getting in a circumstance it looks like it's little

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:24.960
kids reacting and we know as Frank and Otis know we know the ma was a student

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:31.280
student it was a teenager yeah from primary to secondary

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:38.200
somebody all the way from about nine all the way up to about 18 19 about there

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:43.559
yeah so Otis knows it Otis knows it they're trying to write an article to

00:57:43.559 --> 00:57:50.799
figure it out let's follow them look at how fun this is this is glorious I love I love this kind of stuff um he took the

00:57:50.799 --> 00:57:58.200
children in his arms he placed a child before those who asked who would be greatest in the coming Kingdom he

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:03.640
welcomed the praise of children in the temple remember when they all ran into the temple and Jesus kicking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:08.680
and he's like oh and the kids are like a and they're screaming this is what he's

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:14.119
talking about he's he's always he's kind of he's got a herd of children a herd of

00:58:14.119 --> 00:58:22.720
children who's this man with it did nobody think for a minute okay he loved the rich young man

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:30.000
yeah he did love that rich young man I remember that I don't want to be that rich young man in the in the after because who wants to

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:37.720
be known for that an egalitarian Heaven certainly not me oh he's that rich so

00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:44.559
you know what I mean do we not find another marked instance in his friendship for the family in Bethany if

00:58:44.559 --> 00:58:50.799
Lazarus were married strange that his wife does not appear in the narrative and we get the impression that the

00:58:50.799 --> 00:58:58.960
sisters had no husbands it would however be unusual for so many in one household

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:04.039
to remain single after reaching the usual age for marriage which we have

00:59:04.039 --> 00:59:10.640
seen to be 17 or 18 years in the case of men that varies that age varies um

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:17.920
according to region there's no blanket like this guy believes in Bible times and in Bible times there are absolutes

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:24.880
right you can throw a rock from one Village to another where the Customs are totally different so okay in general are

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:32.240
these the ages no no they're not um they hit the the women's age though they're

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:38.640
they're in the neighborhood because women are married off as nymphs because

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:47.240
they are in a biological state where they can produce children most

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:52.359
efficiently they Farmers people remember these are farmers

00:59:52.359 --> 00:59:59.839
herdsmen right what right okay um so that's what he's

00:59:59.839 --> 01:00:06.799
getting into it's it's really strange that Mary and Martha and Lazarus what are they doing that this is they seem

01:00:06.799 --> 01:00:13.839
like children they're they're they're perfectly set in an environment they're children Jesus has more kids that he's

01:00:13.839 --> 01:00:20.440
walking around with let's see what he what he finishes let's finish up that section if Lazarus were married it's

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:27.079
strange that his wife does not appear in the narrative yeah um should we jump down should we not think of the sisters

01:00:27.079 --> 01:00:32.240
as girls under 15 years of age a young girl would be more likely than an adult

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:38.480
male such as um such a to make such a complaint to a visitor as Martha did

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.799
about her sister when we read that Jesus loved Mary Martha and Lazarus we see

01:00:43.799 --> 01:00:51.640
another example of the affection the affectionate Delight ew

01:00:51.640 --> 01:01:00.280
the affectionate Delight that he took in the young okay Jesus Took affectionate from the mouth of the of

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:06.920
Christians themselves Jesus Took Delight in the youth let's bring that

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:11.960
next one okay look at this people the important point however in connection

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:17.559
with our present subject is that as Jesus was so attracted toward the young

01:01:17.559 --> 01:01:23.640
oh I know that sounds bad I know it sounds bad they must have been strongly

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:30.160
attracted to him oh God that sounds worse that sounds worse oh can this guy

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:36.119
can these two people make this any worse and it would have been strange if among

01:01:36.119 --> 01:01:41.720
those most Earnest to receive his teaching there were not some as young as

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:48.200
those who in modern Mission fields are likely to be among the earliest to become his

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:53.440
followers okay did you did you smell

01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:02.039
that wow wow can you believe that does

01:02:02.039 --> 01:02:07.200
that okay people you can't blame them they're Christians and they're trying to

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:14.559
answer the question of why is Jesus associated with a group of 12 boys and

01:02:14.559 --> 01:02:20.799
why is um why is he in the company always of other young people everywhere

01:02:20.799 --> 01:02:26.359
he goes into tombs and he's got boys and tombs he's even dead and his body's gone

01:02:26.359 --> 01:02:33.760
and all of a sudden there's a kid what's going on with this guy with all these children and he yelling in the

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.839
I'm not a child trafficker I'm not I promise okay let's go let's keep rolling

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:46.000
is there one more we will not press the point oh I just want to bring this this is for the British audience just we will

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.680
not press the point that it was very boy likee to forget to take bread when going out on the lake right you see what the

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:58.480
apostles are doing they're screwing up like children he says this is a angry

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:05.640
angry British man I think um and that young people will be more likely than older ones to have an open quarrel over

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:13.680
seats of the table remember the whole question about who's going to sit where right you think a bunch of 35y old

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:20.440
men would be doing that you think a 35y old man would be happy if his mother

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:27.200
came in to Jesus and said let me ask you a favor can my kids sit on your right

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:32.640
hand do seriously people and you thought

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.240
these were oh my God oh my God they're children people perhaps we should not

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.680
make much of their fright he says when the Squall burst on their boat as they

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:50.559
crossed the Sea of Galilee remember I told you we looked at that and the kids they all get crazy they're like and he's

01:03:50.559 --> 01:03:56.799
like maybe we shouldn't make much of that why look Dr George mat this guy has

01:03:56.799 --> 01:04:06.319
hoo-ha up his up his you know what um Dr George maton marveling at their abject

01:04:06.319 --> 01:04:11.880
trepidation big word says listen to this quote listen to

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:17.039
this quote and if you wonder if you wonder King

01:04:17.039 --> 01:04:24.279
Chuck why it's not worth your Allegiance if you wonder here it is

01:04:24.279 --> 01:04:32.319
here's history burping King Chuck R upon your bib here it here it goes fancy a

01:04:32.319 --> 01:04:39.440
company of English Sailors overtaken by a sudden Gale and giving vent to their

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:47.400
feelings in a simultaneous shriek of Terror imagine that fancy

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:55.200
that why why next one why is that fancy to me make your point

01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:03.799
point he explains the mystery for these men are not English oh okay look it's a bunch of

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:10.119

atheist it's the same group you're all atheists I want you to see Jesus for who

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:34.360
he is it looks like we don't have Gnostic tonight Gnostic was going to tell you about epines perhaps he'll call

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.800
up it's time now Gnostic to come up I'll give him two minutes but he may tell you

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:47.360
about epines with his um with his quote that Paul uses and it turns out people

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:52.719
that that quote is from is do we send him okay

01:27:52.719 --> 01:27:58.360
um I'll assume he can't make it um but he had an excellent point um

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:06.000
and that's that we have a source comes through fius quoting somebody um tmy

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.840
somebody or else um and anyhow uh by the way there are thousands of these unknown

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:17.960
people from Antiquity um who an author like gayen will say the physician Andreas says in his great work blah blah

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:23.800
blah right you didn't even know there was such thing as a dude named Andreas who was writing medical documents right

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:29.239
but yeah he's there right um and one of these talks about one of these talks

01:28:29.239 --> 01:28:34.639
about um epines um quote and says hey uh this

01:28:34.639 --> 01:28:40.239
thing is actually from media media was the one who used it when Paul quotes

01:28:40.239 --> 01:28:47.239
epines he is quoting media directly he is quoting media

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:53.679
directly yeah when she called the create

01:28:53.679 --> 01:29:04.760
Liars because they had misjudged a contest yeah Paul quotes that through

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:10.440
epines which is highly highly ironic beautiful and ironic at the same time

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:17.880
tonight we got to see a little bit of Jesus we got to see a little testimony we got to see who the man was
