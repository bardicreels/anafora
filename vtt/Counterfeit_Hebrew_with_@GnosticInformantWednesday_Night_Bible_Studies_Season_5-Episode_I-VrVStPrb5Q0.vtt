by putting you into a space tonight I want to bring up Echo and I want you to be

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:30.300
thinking about people across time and about the transmission of the logos

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.120
this is from a little one of our dead sources where'd he go

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.720
that we're going to reach through that back into the Hebrew and you say what you never do Hebrew what's the deal

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.519
what's the deal with the Hebrew this is what this is what the trans-dimensional D.A

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.640
has given us it turns out we've got evidence that Hebrew

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.239
Hebrew is a creation yeah yeah it's a creation a synthesis

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.840
a fabrication we're counterfeiting a language

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.060
tonight we're going back to take these texts back and tonight we're going to

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.340
look at it as scientists let's bring on the echo we'll look

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:46.379
through the echo Chewie [Music]

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.459
thank you

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:46.009
thank you [Music]

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.340
thank you the beauty of Greek physics

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.580
brought to you by the logos fantastic tonight I want to start and I

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.919
just want to say welcome welcome to all of you who are biblical Scholars tonight

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.979
especially tonight the biblical Scholars have a seat right up in the front

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.320
for those of you who do religious studies for those of you who do Biblical Hebrew

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.479
tonight the front is for you

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:35.160
I want to look at some facts pulled right out of the crazy web I want to pull these out

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.940
and I want to just ask a question a couple of questions basic questions let's give me that first

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.880
first location on the star chart yeah there you go take it just take a

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:56.820
look at some of these facts look the number of attested Biblical Hebrew words is 8198. okay okay of which some 2 000 or

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.419
high box lagomina take it down high pox lagomina what is the high points that is

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:09.840
a word that appears only once we only have one reference to it and usually with those words

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.620
you really can't understand what they mean the definitions are extremely short because they're essentially a guess

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.259
so we've got two thousand so that leaves us with 6 000 words that we know we can

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:28.139
trace six thousand words fantastic is that a lot is that a lot

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:34.080
let's let's keep going let's keep going you you Biblical Hebrew Scholars hang in

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.120
there with me the Oxford English Dictionary estimates they're around 170

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:47.699
000 words in current use in English with an additional 47 000 obsolete words that's interesting

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:53.639
according to dictionary.com over half the words in English dictionary I come from Greek and Latin on the academic

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:59.699
word list it's closer to two-thirds take that down oh my goodness you mean

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.919
two-thirds of our words in English that we're using every day come from

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:11.460
classical Origins Greek and Latin yes 170 000 is impressive

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:17.039
that's an impressive amount you know okay so two-thirds of them are from a

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:22.680
different language namely the one that we're studying yeah okay

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.860
what do we do then Chewie hit us with the Second Sight we're going in for their Fighters get us look at this can

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:34.020
you blow that up so I can read that for the crowd yeah Biblical Hebrew has a

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:40.139
very limited vocabulary of less than 9 000 words but it's tremendously rich in

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:46.620
expressing itself oh you can leave it oh seriously

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.660
why would you say but but is tremendously Rich when you're a linguist

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:59.240
and you gotta apologize for the language something's wrong something's wrong of the 13

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:06.319
962 words in classical Hebrews 6556 or homonyms

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:12.539
according to Gil gilad Zuckerman the number of attested Biblical Hebrew words

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:18.780
is 8198. look at this they're counting guys get your counts down

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:25.379
right come on man yes two thousand are hoboks the number of attested Bible Hebrew words is eight

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:30.720
one nine eight the number of a desert bib away rewards is 8679.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:38.899
foreign what about the Greek

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:47.060
if you have 8 000 words you can speak your entire vocabulary

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:53.820
within hours of waking up yeah yeah

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:59.459
how can a language function on 8 000 words when three thousand of

00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:06.000
those are hypoxagomina it can't they don't modern Hebrew has

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.279
around forty to sixty thousand it's growing right modern Hebrew was a

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:17.640
recreation of a dead language it's vibrant and alive

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:25.019
shout out to all my buds in Israel yeah vibrant language and growing

00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:30.540
they'll grow their vocabulary yes as all languages do

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:37.620
sixty thousand is functional three thousand to four thousand is not

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:43.440
is not there is something wrong here

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:50.519
there's a reason that Julian Africa Julius Africanus having his debates with origin and the

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:57.540
Christians on where is this language in the Septuagint coming from there's a reason he says this is great there's no

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:04.260
way you're made up story about 72 dudes going into 72 different rooms and coming

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:10.380
out with this translation of Greek from some Hebrew original no way

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:16.500
no way it's Greek but wait a minute

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.140
if the Old Testament is Greek

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.360
why do we have a Hebrew version yeah and

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:35.519
is that Hebrew version accurate can you take 8 000 words and turn them into a

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:41.519
hundred and fifty thousand now you know why

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:49.680
now you know why it doesn't say what it does fantastic let's go down to the next uh

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:56.880
star chart boom this is from Biblical Hebrew Made Easy the Hebrew vocabulary

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:03.000
how much is enough the law of diminishing returns right they've got to sit they've got to sit where is this

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.980
gentleman from now go down to the next uh who is this this is Reverend Dr Walter Meyer three

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:17.399
professor of Hebrew at Concordia Theological Seminary

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:22.920
Betty writes books and what does he say

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:31.760
he says there are 419 000 words in the Hebrew Old Testament text of those 419 000 words

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:39.300
6679 are unique that compose the total usage so the question is how many of those

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:44.640
words do I need to have absolute Mastery over to be competent in biblical look

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:52.320
what he says 1903 words will get you all the way

00:11:52.320 --> 00:12:00.060
to that Galaxy wow is that even possible

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:05.220
yeah as a philologist and somebody who studied

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:12.480
the development of these languages and the languages that existed a thousand years before Hebrew

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.600
yeah I have to say it's starting to look bad

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.920
starting to look real bad now the fact that this professor can say

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:28.680
the way to learn Hebrew is to memorize a thousand nine hundred of their words

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:34.860
or a thousand something 90 whatever it was that's that shows you the fact that we

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:42.899
don't need grammar shows you something is wrong you're working with a counterfeited language the masoretic sex

00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:48.300
is reforming the Hebrew and you say wait

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:55.940
this is for the scholars biblical scars you say well what no

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:03.260
I won't because the simple fact is

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:09.959
your language is inadequate well [Music]

00:13:09.959 --> 00:13:18.540
it's a falsified form and you say no no they found they found these parts

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:24.360
with some fragments in them they found ports with fragments sometimes they'll

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:30.380
have a collar they found Parts with fragments sometimes they won't sometimes they'll be wearing some accoutrement

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:40.139
sometimes they won't but they'll always tell you the same thing they found some fragments in a cave

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:46.579
yeah that had Greek in them and were translations of the Greek

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:54.360
doesn't impress me your first to third Century finding doesn't impress me

00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:00.660
let me take you to a book a book of the Bible That's supposed to

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:06.120
be from the 6th century and just from

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:12.600
the stylistic analysis for all of you at Harvard and Princeton Yale

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:20.700
the stylistic analysis of the Greek is going to put the Scrolls sometime around the third or

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:27.139
second first I'd put it second to First stylistically BC

00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:34.740
cracky Reed bro I don't care about Yuri I talk oh no domini and before it

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:42.360
yeah bcna Libra so what happens to the this text let's

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:48.839
look let's look at how the you know long story short long story short before we get and by the way naked Jesus is

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:55.019
waiting for us right before we get to Gnostic informant

00:14:55.019 --> 00:15:00.300
we've we're going to get to naked Jesus so just wait he's back there anybody who

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:06.860
came who doesn't want to see Jesus naked better leave

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:14.279
this is how you know this is how the serious make their way we do it through the text

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:20.579
I'm going to take you right to him right sitting there all naked rubbing people's feet

00:15:20.579 --> 00:15:26.579
with his underwear it's a thing I don't know one of them

00:15:26.579 --> 00:15:34.920
got mad and left it doesn't matter nobody knew what he was saying okay let's go to the text pull it up I'm

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:41.220
gonna call this Zacharias because that's the name that is on the Greek text that we have

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:47.459
Zacharias some of you will say no this is Zechariah

00:15:47.459 --> 00:15:52.160
that's fine but realize you're wrong

00:15:56.839 --> 00:16:03.380
in the very first line leave it up to you in the very first line you're going to see a word that last word

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:08.639
that is a word that is has no equivalence no equivalence in Hebrew the

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:14.100
word before it curios do you know how they translate that they

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:19.620
translate that with that tetragrammaton a made-up word they translate this with

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:26.459
a medieval made-up word yeah do you understand this is Yahweh

00:16:26.459 --> 00:16:31.860
and you say wait a minute this isn't anything Yahweh like this is curios this

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.899
is the master word how could the Greeks how could the

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:42.600
Greeks expect me to believe the 72 Jewish Scholars went into 72 different

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.880
rooms and took a Hebrew text and wrote out the exact trans exact same

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:54.360
transaction all 72 of them and that's not even the miraculous part the miraculous part is they were able to

00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:00.899
use words that didn't exist in Hebrew because they only had several thousand of them to play with

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:07.798
seriously seriously and they have passed this off

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:14.459
on you and you sit around I can see you out there you sit around

00:17:14.459 --> 00:17:21.660
and you absorb this just automatically right and what do we do we accept it and

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:26.880
we go forward and it creates the world that we think exists but doesn't

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:34.520
yeah before we go on with the text I'm getting so hot in here this is so good

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:42.000
can we see a comment somebody left a comment for me that I wanted to address just real quick we'll take a little two

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.220
minute break from the language should we blow that that's good that's good

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:52.380
if this is from yeah Jody Jody Jody if

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:57.539
they traumatize the kids likely they will cause

00:17:57.539 --> 00:18:04.020
what is that cause cptsd that doesn't sound good right

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:10.080
which would rewire the brain to be in a constant state of fight or flight is the

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:15.120
main neurotransmitter will become noradrenaline

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:24.020
uh go ahead and leave it up there just for that first part of it I just have to say fascinating

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:30.000
fascinating is a man who studied neurotransmitters in the brain I'm glad

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
you're looking at neurotransmitters nice if they further hobble the children oh

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.020
Jody okay look right it's history right it's

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:48.539
history so let's she may have a good point here Jody I'm assume your female

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:55.440
could be male Jody if you humble the children so as to prevent running to escape such as

00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.900
such as make it so they are slower they would be fierce and redacted strong

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:06.539
Fighters Jody my goodness where is your thought

00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:11.640
pattern what are you thinking is this what the people on this channel have

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:18.240
been thinking or these the thoughts you don't need to hobble the children so

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:24.960
they don't get away you've dropped them you've dropped them no need problem right come on come on

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:32.220
guys let's catch up let's catch up that's not a bad idea right I mean I like your creative thinking and you know

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:39.660
like Einstein you gotta you gotta think about these things imaginary thought experiments I got them but don't worry

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:46.440
they're drugs the kids are drunk thank you Jody for the comment let's go on with the let's go on with the text I

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:54.799
want to flash that video again in a second but let's look at this oh oh my goodness what are you gonna say is

00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:01.980
look there's this dude and his name is Anatole his name is

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:11.880
Anatole yeah and he is rising up from below the underworld and he is ruling

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:18.480
his Lord's House and this guy this guy's gonna he's gonna

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:26.220
get some oddite he's gonna get some virtue he's going to get Seated on that Throne of his father and he's gonna rule

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:32.400

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:38.520
and his peaceful counsel right it's gonna extend between the two of what did

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:46.100
you say his name was his name was Anatole everybody said on the second line it says Anatoly go down to the next

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:53.580
boom let's just get these guys go down to the there we go look at this Anatoly

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:59.039
Rising above the Horizon of any Heavenly Body

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:05.820
yeah the rising star you'll see that this equals and see how much meaning the

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:11.760
Greeks put into this word choose this word especially

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:20.039
by a bunch of divinely inspired rabbis choose this word is pure genius

00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:26.100
it's too bad that the people who actually translated the Greek into

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:32.760
Hebrew for the Hebrew Bible it's too bad they didn't have a word that matched

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:39.900
this word or even came close to this word or even was in the same Cosmos as

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:47.400
this word but they didn't so how did they translate this go back up to the translation one before uh look at this

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.799
look it's good no wonder it makes me a little bit nauseous and

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:58.799
say to him thus says the Lord of hosts that's how they Translate pantocrato

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:05.700
terrible right then for the context you're already you've already lost the context congratulations

Branch are you sure it says the branch you mean these 72 God Yahweh

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.880

for branch dude this works for branch why not so lay is is a miracle it was a

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.000
freaking miracle listen people I'm trying to show you

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.840
that what happened was that this material was originally in Greek and it

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:22.500
was then taken and translated into Hebrew just like Africanus said

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:28.020
yeah it's not me how to make this up linguistically it's all there let's go

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:34.559

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:07.919
they getting that they're getting that from the mazarites because it doesn't say that in the Septuagint there is nothing there

00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:14.520
about building a temple there is nothing there is nothing is there a reason that

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:20.940

000 people raised their hands which one do you want the guy in the Bronze Age the guy and the you want the

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:43.380
guy who's popular don't you you want the guy that the Romans crucified where is he where's that Jesus

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:49.140
right it's a title it's a linguistic title it is an epithet

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:56.340
it is not a personal name you only think it is because those macerates and the

00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:02.760
people who were sitting in the caves with the texts trying to translate them into a language that didn't exist and

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:08.118
wasn't read anymore wasn't spoken wasn't even at that point liturgical

00:34:08.119 --> 00:34:15.060
those people created your delusion [Music]

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:21.358
yeah so here's this Jesus sitting at the table and what does he do I need to text

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:26.700
back he gets up when he takes off his clothes

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:33.839
and taking a lintion Lin tion what is that it's a little

00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:39.358
washcloth or towel right it's something that attendants carry in the bath after

00:34:39.359 --> 00:34:45.898
the bath to dry you off and what does Jesus do in his glorious nakedness thanks I just ate

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:52.260
he raised us from everybody he just stripped and what's he doing he's he's putting on

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:58.500
a linthian what is he doing he de-adjusting what he ties it around his

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:07.859
privets his privities ties it around his genitalia he gerds

00:35:07.859 --> 00:35:14.660
yes that's how people that's probably how you've heard it if you're a Christian you're sitting here or a Biblical scholar scratching your head

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:22.079
gerd gerd sorry I don't mean to yell guard your loins with that towel from

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:27.240
the masseuse Garden GERD

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:35.460
and then what happens well he goes on we don't need to taste this final just tell him he goes on and he washes feet and

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:42.900
then dries feet with his towel wait he takes off his towel we've got

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:50.760
two possibilities he either takes off his towel and nakedly dries my feet with his dirty

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:55.920
dirty underwear

00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:03.900
or or perhaps he leaves his underwear on and dries my

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:09.359
feet [Laughter]

00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:15.540
nobody understands is this a look look for the look look your pastor all right

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:20.940
let's get I know I'm all sweaty today but the pastor look I gotta say the

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:28.440
pastor's gonna pull you aside and he's gonna say hey this is all about washing feet this is

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:34.800
all about washing feet yeah and this is something they did

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:40.380
in antiquity when you hear a generalization like that which they do

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:46.440
no generalizations don't mean anything I could listen to them shows on the right

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:52.859
now on YouTube that have to do with mystery rights and I can tell you within two seconds whether or not the person

00:36:52.859 --> 00:36:58.200
knows a damn thing about their sources why because they generalize when they

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:03.720
don't they generalize when they don't you either speak from specific evidence you

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:09.720
shut your mouth yeah if you're out there faking mystery religion

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:15.480
it's time to burn It's Time To Burn yeah

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.640

00:37:26.099 --> 00:37:33.900
yeah blow that up please Chewie I just want everybody to see this these are these are just little Snippets in

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:39.660
English and in Greek from that scene when he had finished washing their feet

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:46.440
he put his clothes on and returned to his place there he is okay so he just put his clothes back on if you never

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:51.599
thought you'd see naked Jesus you just did he just put his clothes back on do

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:57.359
you understand what I've done to you he asked them and they see says I have set

00:37:57.359 --> 00:38:02.940
you an example that you should do as I've done for you and then he breaks

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:09.839
into this magic incantation a main a main a man when you start repeating a

00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:18.000
man the origin is this thing is of this thing is from a moon it is used all over the PGM and it is

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:27.720

than his curios nobody is sent out right who's greater than the one who's sending

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:44.460
right now that you know these things you will be blessed if you do them and wait what's happened they're all looking at

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:49.680
each other scratching their head and he and then he says right I'm not referring

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:54.960
to you all I know those I have chosen wait a minute

00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:01.140
I got invited to this dinner dude strips down naked washes my feet with his

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:06.780
underwear tells me some crazy Hub job mob job and

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:13.380
says you don't understand but not all of you are supposed to okay thanks

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:21.359
it's quite a show keep it up keep it up and then he bursts into this man

00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:28.560
Lego woman you guys is going to turn me over to the

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:34.820
cops you're gonna give me up his distance now watch what happened right this is what I'm doing at the time

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:41.240
his disciples stared at one another at a loss to know which of them he meant

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:47.940
but no one at the meal understood by uh uh what why Jesus said this to

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:55.440
them yeah right see how we end the dinner we all go away scratching our head like what's this guy's problem what's this

00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:02.640
guy's problem he just strips down that's creepy within a very short period of Time same

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:11.700
dude arrested in a public park with a naked boy Mark 14 51 and 52.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:18.599
this Jesus the one that you all know got arrested in a public park with a naked

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:25.800
boy you've seen Jesus naked it shouldn't surprise you that he's got a naked boy

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:33.300
with him when he gets arrested and that naked boy isn't chained up he's not hobbled

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:39.420
we got him set up here right we're not lay Stace

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:44.520
we're not child traffickers and she'd look at us that way

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:50.280
right we're sons of God fantastic let's bring in Neil if he's if

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:55.380
he hasn't fallen asleep from me taking so long Neil 42. how you how you doing

00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:01.560
Gnostic informant good I was uh intense uh lesson right there on this on the

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:07.920
Greek one of the things I was I noticed about the text um is when you when we're looking at

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:14.760
which one's translation and which one looks like on the native text one of the things I know I'm not this is not my

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:21.839
expertise or anything I'm basing this off what you said and I've also talked to other people who brought up this from

00:41:21.839 --> 00:41:28.800
the historical perspective Russell gramerkin sees the same thing you're seeing you're talking about it from the language perspective putting those two

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:36.599
together I don't know if it's hard to argue against that one of the things I noticed when I look at Zechariah 6 and

00:41:36.599 --> 00:41:42.599
the Septuagint uh well actually first let me let me start with the uh let me start with the

00:41:42.599 --> 00:41:47.760
NIV when I read it for the first time I'm gonna share my screen right real quick if you don't mind

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:55.099
so if I don't know if you can see this or not Zechariah 6 has this name in there

00:41:55.099 --> 00:42:01.859
Zephaniah okay and it says that these are the sons of Zephaniah who came from who came to

00:42:01.859 --> 00:42:07.200
Babylon well okay if this is a this is their original text then what does the

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:13.140
translation say now if you don't mind I'm going to share my screen again on a different page and I thought this was

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:21.420
interesting because the Septuagint says or here it is right here verse 10.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:26.520
Sophie Neal that's a name now that means Sophia

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:31.680
that's wisdom that's a title why would they translate Zephaniah into

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:37.140
a word that makes sense the sons of the wisdom that came from Babylon there's

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:43.579
that word Babylon that looks like a pun it looks like a native text Zephaniah looks like it's a transliteration of

00:42:43.579 --> 00:42:49.980
Sophie Neo am I crazy what do you think about that no I think you're exactly right and

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:56.280
there's no reason if this is a translation from Hebrew to Greek there's no reason they wouldn't have used the

00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:03.000
Zeta and just spelled out the name of them either instead they picked a different name yeah looks like it's

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.359
based on the roots wise and mind definitely it could ice might the Sun to the wise minded who came from Babylon

00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:16.859
now this is where it gets crazy and now I've did some digging myself into what does it mean to be the East and to be a

00:43:16.859 --> 00:43:23.520
son of Babylon or son of wisdom and I looked into the what does the Greek World say before all this and it turns

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:30.300
out that there's so if he's citing a a an

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:37.980
older uh prophecy that comes from Balaam if you go to the text numbers 24 this is

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:44.460
what this is this is this is the slam dunk for me why I think the Zechariah in Greek is the original text so when you

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:52.560
look at numbers 24 there's a couple more screens I got to share all of a sudden we have a prior prophecy

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:59.040
where Balaam is talking about a star will come out of Jacob

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:06.000
that stuff what is a star a rising star comes from the East the Morning Star

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.160
so all of a sudden this entire book makes sense now and I'm going to show you why right now I'm at one more screen

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:16.560
I want to share because in the beginning of the passes that you just read he's talking about the four wins in every

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:22.859
direction the four chariots coming from the Four Winds well we know what that is

00:44:22.859 --> 00:44:29.640
we know that's Australia's I'm gonna share my screen again Australia's means starry

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:37.859
an astrological deity he's the father of the Four Winds hold on a second this entire passage in

00:44:37.859 --> 00:44:44.220
Zechariah is about the sons of the Four Winds are the sons of the star I'm sorry

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:49.619
the star that rises from the East it's the morning star and look at this EOS

00:44:49.619 --> 00:44:55.020
foros is the son of Dawn and Estrellas and then there's your Four Winds the

00:44:55.020 --> 00:45:03.300
siblings and it gets even crazier astraya is the virgin daughter

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:10.079
this is basically like the the image of Lady Babylon if you will the virgin daughter who is the

00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:16.140
um uh the embodiment of Justice she's depicted is holding the the scales

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:21.839
so all of a sudden in the Greek text you have all this language in there and all

00:45:21.839 --> 00:45:28.859
of it makes sense you have a rising star comes out of the East just as Balin prophesied those texts link up and then

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:34.020
you have your four wins and then you have your Rising Star the Greek makes sense but when you read

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:39.060
it in the Hebrew you don't have that element of the of the rising star coming from the East so you're like what are

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:46.079
these Four Winds even coming from a branch who is the branch so it loses its it loses its meaning

00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:51.240
completely yeah what yeah and what's even supports

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:56.520
your point even more is the fact that we know that there were

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:03.300
sex of Christianity that were blamed with following that prophecy and with

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:09.480
following Balaam and they they called it the way of Cain so the fact that Lucifer

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:15.260
and the throne is there I mean he shows up in Zechariah in the very beginning

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:20.880
standing on the right hand of the Jesus we have a tiebreaker just in case

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:26.460
someone's on the fence right now and you're thinking all right I see what you're saying but

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:32.400
it's still possible that the the branch could be the original and they they made

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:39.480
it maybe they made it make more sense later all right let's bring it let's bring in a tiebreaker what is the Syriac version

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:45.300
say we have a Syriac text now that text could have translated it from any one of

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:51.000
those sources right let's say that we're assuming they both exist there's a Hebrew out there there's a Greek out

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.480
there and they're both floating around and the syriacs are going to translate the text it's called the pashita very

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:03.180
famous text it's the Syriac version of the Bible I'm sharing my screen right now

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:10.500
what does it say it says Behold a man whose name is sunrise

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:17.579
Dinka sunrise that's the star that's the rising star of the East the

00:47:17.579 --> 00:47:22.859
sun only rises in the East you'll never see the sun rise in the west so the

00:47:22.859 --> 00:47:28.980
sunrise is the East it fits with the Septuagint perfectly

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:36.599
yeah to me that was like all right that's it I mean we can see which one is the the free-flowing the one that seems

00:47:36.599 --> 00:47:43.500
like the original it feels like it's it's uh naturally being like woven out the story The Plot all of it makes it's

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:49.740
not like clunky it's not like it doesn't look like it's stitched together in a weird way am I right

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:55.020
yeah and what's glorious is that that Syriac version is a translation

00:47:55.020 --> 00:48:01.619
obviously of that older Greek so um yeah it does not make sense people when you

00:48:01.619 --> 00:48:07.020
translate it into a language that only has a pool of several thousand words to

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:14.819
draw from so they're not going to be able to embody the concepts when you're reading the King James version or any

00:48:14.819 --> 00:48:21.359
modern version that basically cheated off King James and you get to a point where you're like oh my God I'm kind of

00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:27.380
stumbling like what what's happening those fractures I call them are all over

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:33.180
the Old Testament and those fractures are because the Hebrew was incapable of

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:38.339
expressing what was the Greek was actually saying so it becomes

00:48:38.339 --> 00:48:44.119
nonsensical and unfortunately there's a lot of places there and pastors and teachers

00:48:44.119 --> 00:48:51.060
Scholars they have to excuse why this is happening they have to make up a reason

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:58.980
for why it's happening the translation is so terrible remember this is supposedly the inspired translation that

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:04.680
is so perfect all 72 of those idiots came out with the same copy right right

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:10.260
come on man let's not let's not Neil is it just me or is this is one thing about

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:17.880
that that that that story that we get from Josephus about the 70 elders there's one thing in there that I think

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:23.119
he sort of slips up on like what happened because he mentions Demetrius

00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:29.220
Demetrius Valeria who came from from Athens down to Alexandria and he says it

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:35.940
was Demetrius valerion who was given the job by Ptolemy Ptolemy Philadelphia's

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:40.980
given the job to Demetrius to put together all the texts of all the world

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:46.440
and they said and then and then Ptolemy came to him like a few months later and was like how many books did you end up

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:52.500
collecting he's like I can't even count tens of thousands hundreds of thousands who knows we have every book from the

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:58.859
world and so this is the time period where uh the the Septuagint the Bible is

00:49:58.859 --> 00:50:05.520
produced and then the last so I heard I've heard this argument from a historical perspective like I said from

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:12.960
Russell gomerkin he's done peer-reviewed work on this stuff everyone hates them they all they want they want them to shut up nobody wants to like give I I

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:19.920
haven't heard any academics like refute what he's saying they just want to pretend he's not there like just ignore him he's not there but he's been saying

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:26.940
this for years he wrote books about Plato and the creation of the Hebrew Bible how the Bible there's no sources

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:33.000
of the Bible before the third Century or fourth Century BCE all of a sudden just shows up in literature everywhere people

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.099
are cited all the time after 300 before 300 nobody talks about there's nobody

00:50:38.099 --> 00:50:43.980
referencing Zechariah there's nobody referencing Isaiah there's nobody referencing Moses barely you you only

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:49.680
hear him in like the 4th Century BCE by hectates of hem abdara that's the first time you hear

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:55.260
about Moses and so the so when I heard this argument I I would go back to this

00:50:55.260 --> 00:51:00.720
other academics and say what do you think about this and they'd say yeah I get what he's saying but there's one

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:06.660
thing that he is a full stop for me and this is why I think the Hebrew is original and I'd say what is that

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:12.180
and I heard this from multiple people it's a really good it sounds like a

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:19.079
really good argument I'll show you what it is in a second he's they'd say um how would the Hebrew Bible know about

00:51:19.079 --> 00:51:25.140
the Sumerian texts because there's no doubt about it if you read Genesis you're going to get references of

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:31.200
Sumerian like like even not even just Genesis the book of assyr for example seems to be borrowing from the story of

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:38.099
Ishtar how do these how do these Greeks in the third Century BCE know about all the if

00:51:38.099 --> 00:51:43.559
this is the original then how do they know about all the Sumerian stuff and I said holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you have a good point

00:51:43.559 --> 00:51:49.079
there and then I left it alone for six months and then doing my what I what I

00:51:49.079 --> 00:51:55.500
always do I like to study and I and I wanted to do a book a video about Alexander so I bought this it's the

00:51:55.500 --> 00:52:01.680
campaigns of Alexander by Aryan and I'm reading it and I'm learning a lot about Alexander and all of a sudden I flip to

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:07.020
this page and all of a sudden it says I'll show you I'm going to show you on the screen

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:13.980
this astronomical tablet was discovered in Babylon and it's in cuneiform

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:21.599
cuneiform and that's then it says this astronomical habit is found in Babylon it records the entry of Alexander into

00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:26.880
Babylon and 323 BCE

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:33.240
I'm sorry three 331 BCE the other one I'll show you that the other day something else what the hell so they

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:38.400
were still using cuneiform in the time of Alexander and they're like okay that's when he got there maybe that was

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:44.520
one of the scribes left over from the Persians and like okay maybe that's true all of a sudden I keep going I go to

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:50.460
another page and I find another one and this time it's same thing it's cuneiform tablet

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:56.400
and it says today is the day Alexander has died June 11th and then which

00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:01.680
equates to 3 323 BCE so in the fourth at

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:07.380
the end of the fourth Century BCE we have Greek scribes that know and can

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:13.500
read and write and translate cuneiform tablets these tablets were brought to

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:19.500
Alexandria and that's how you get your Septuagint we have evidence of Greeks knowing

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:25.559
knowing these texts so that that argument that how do they know Sumerian it's over with we have the evidence

00:53:25.559 --> 00:53:32.220
right here glorious glorious now does everybody see that there's no theory in there there's

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:38.880
no ideas he's not going to write a book and make money on that book because of his dumb idea all he's doing is saying

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:45.720
look at this time they already had access they're doing the cuneiform and they're assembling Alexandria in the

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:52.740
library is an assemblage of all of the world's work I mean they have collected

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:58.740
and gathered the Romans copy and do the same thing right they're trying to negro is trying to get worse from all over the

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:06.300
world it's called building a library go around Ephesus look at the freaking Library that's there Temple of the muses

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:11.520
baby yeah Neil people don't get it but you you're you're seeing it right you're

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:17.700
seeing that that real history how does it feel to see like the reality behind the fairy tale

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:23.160
oh it's just absolutely liberating to just to not have not and I used to have

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:28.559
to argue I used to be in a position where this had to be right so I had to have I had to find a way to like

00:54:28.559 --> 00:54:34.319
convince myself to you know argue for it apologize for it find ways around it but

00:54:34.319 --> 00:54:40.020
it's still possible if this happened all these different xyz's that I'm throwing in the equation when it's just like

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:45.420
Occam's razor slice it right in half it's like the text shows up in this decade

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:51.839
you know what I mean and by the way even the fairy tale from you called it the fairy tale even josephus's passage about

00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:58.920
the creation of the Septuagint even he said like he doesn't he's not saying this is a Bible that was already

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:06.900
there that he's translating he's telling you this is being produced for the first time so even in that instance you're

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:12.000
still being told this this is being put together for the first time ever

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.640
yeah it's it's uh it's amazing that we can have such strong evidence that just

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:22.680
due to religious tradition um we can deny it we can deny the logic

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:30.059
and the reason and you know nil you know if you've got a room full of 10 Scholars that you've had on and you know you know

00:55:30.059 --> 00:55:35.880
you'd get that you could whip them up into a huge argument if you said this what we said tonight they would say no

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:42.480
there's no way that that's possible right right yeah they're just saying I've never

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:48.119
heard that I don't know any experts that that's kind of like the way a lot and I'm not like I'm not saying I'm better

00:55:48.119 --> 00:55:54.480
or smarter than anyone else but like you get this a lot where people will if they haven't heard it from a big scholar yet

00:55:54.480 --> 00:56:01.260
if it had did it if it didn't come out of the mouth of like Israel Finkelstein or Bart Airman then that then it's

00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:07.500
probably not true like they'll be like no because I would they would know they would know like I'm like I'm not saying that I'm right

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:13.260
or I know everything but but like you you'll hear that defense a lot where I haven't heard any any real major

00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:20.040
Scholars put this forth yet so I don't know and they'll just shut it down right there like if that's the way we look at

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:26.640
everything then how does anything change how do you how do you change any how do you present any evidence I mean I guess

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:32.579
it's happening now with what you're doing and with Russell America's doing but I'm I'm ready to I just want I'm

00:56:32.579 --> 00:56:38.640
ready to hear some uh pushback like where's the evidence against this where is the citation of the Hebrew Bible in

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:44.099
this fifth sixth centuries where it says to be written it I want to see that stuff right and you're not going to see

00:56:44.099 --> 00:56:52.020
it and they know they can't produce it they don't have the goods but their jobs and their books all depend upon this I

00:56:52.020 --> 00:57:00.359
mean thing I would love to talk I'd give a shout out there and an invitation to talk anytime anytime Dr Bart Ehrman Dr

00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:01.619
screen You're gonna laugh and you see so Bart Airman is a brilliant textual

00:58:01.619 --> 00:58:07.020
critic scholar he knows the manuscript Traditions he'll tell you what year it came out what

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:12.780
where city was produced in he's the man he's the world class Bible scholar when

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:18.900
it comes to textual criticism when he starts talking about Greek [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or or Classics he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he has no idea

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:24.780
what he's doing and I'm gonna prove it to you right now I'm sorry to say I have to do this because I'm on a Channel right now that takes this stuff

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:30.359
seriously so Bart Aaron writes this blog he never even corrected it either

00:58:30.359 --> 00:58:37.200
from 2016. you see this on the screen you see it okay he says I mentioned the

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:42.839
previous post the scariest remember days of diogenes polio cretes

00:58:42.839 --> 00:58:50.819
huh who's that and then it says oh the Macedonian overlords Oh you mean you

00:58:50.819 --> 00:58:58.500
mean uh Demetrius okay that's not he spelled the he got the name wrong it's Demetrius polio

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:05.579
Creedence but it gets it gets worse though it gets worse so we can party we can pardon Bart for a name or two [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

00:59:05.579 --> 00:59:11.760
Neil I can't remember I can't remember half of course it gets worse because look at it okay he then says I should

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:17.520
point out that uh he was where does it say it says he was

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:22.559
uh he was worshiped okay here it is right here this the

00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:29.700
conquerances who claim this Divine being by a hymn writer wait a minute even the guy Demetrius

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:35.880
polio cretis that's not even the same guy as Demetrius soter

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:41.700
so he's got two different Demetrius is confused and then he calls him diogenes

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:48.480
so he goes it's not even the same Demetrius that he's trying to talk about he gets the name wrong and confuses him

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:54.480
with the same guy who he thinks he's talking about oh that's all that's like me talking about Game of Thrones and

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:59.819
being like oh um you know like getting getting the good guy's name mixed up

00:59:59.819 --> 01:00:06.780
with the bad guy or something and like being an expert on it like that's a bad mistake he has stepped in it with you he's

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:12.599
stamped in it with Gnostic informant there because non-stick in foreign I don't know if you guys know it I'm just

01:00:12.599 --> 01:00:19.380
pointing out that this is when he's in his own lane you can't touch him when he's doing his own Bible scholar stuff I

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:25.980
was talking about Greek history he has no idea what he's talking about look look Neil is the he's mastering the

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:34.079
Hellenistic era he loves it he loves Alexander the Great and everything that follows before the rise of the Romans he

01:00:34.079 --> 01:00:40.559
loves Alexander to actium by Green he loves all this stuff you cannot I'm

01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:46.020

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:51.240
stuff and I'm like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's gonna start telling me about her cousin and stuff like that and the stuff that's

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:57.660

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:03.299
know real quick do you want to show them what what Nona

01:01:03.299 --> 01:01:08.880
says about this morning star real quick or is that another day no I think it's another day let's say that for next time

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:15.180
hey guys can we bring Gnostic informant back right can we bring him back and by

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:22.380
the way notice notice talks about the exact same thing that Zechariah is talking about in the dionysica in book

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:29.880
six he's got the rising star of the East and the Four Winds it's all in there yeah yeah and did you see he's got the

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:37.980
dragon in there too yep yeah when Mars he says the Virgin Estrellas riding on

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:43.260
the dragon it's in known as we gotta get that we gotta do this that's a whole

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:49.020
that's a whole show that's a whole show let me let me say something about Neil before we finish up I just want

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:54.960
everybody to know that Neil is working uh has allowed me to work with him a

01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:00.540
little bit um in making videos and everybody's noticing that Neil's like up to he's

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:07.619
getting hundreds of thousands of views and whatnot people are finally looking at the art that he is creating and he's

01:02:07.619 --> 01:02:13.079
got an audience so congratulations congratulations Neil but the thing that

01:02:13.079 --> 01:02:20.900
impresses me most about Neil is that he said forget the merch forget the merch

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:26.760
he'd say he sent me a message the other day out of the blue I don't know what happened the devil kicked him in the

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:32.099
groin and he came out with absolute truth and he said this is not about the

01:02:32.099 --> 01:02:40.559
money none of this stuff should be about the money these academics make me sick and I was like brah brah that's a man

01:02:40.559 --> 01:02:48.839
that's a man so Neil thank you thank you appreciate it yeah all right I'm going

01:02:48.839 --> 01:02:55.380
to give you the last word and then I'm gonna say he'll say Neil what's your last bit of wisdom so if you want to oh if you want this

01:02:55.380 --> 01:03:01.559
context to make sense Zechariah is actually that's Zechariah Chapter six or book six I mean

01:03:01.559 --> 01:03:07.440
the most luciferian text in the entire Bible and if you want

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:13.500
to if you want to understand what he's talking about take Zechariah 6 read it it's very short book and then go to

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:20.640
notice by the way they're both book six six six six oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I just noticed that Zechariah is six and then go to known as

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:26.160
book six dionysica read known as dionysica book six and then compare it

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:32.819
to Zechariah it all makes sense the East has to be the the native text because it only

01:03:32.819 --> 01:03:39.059
makes sense if you have a rising star of the east and by the way what what is the star you see when the sun is rising

01:03:39.059 --> 01:03:44.280
during Dawn that's Lucifer so the rising star you know the title that Jesus

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:51.599
himself says I am the Morning Star I am the star rising out of the East I am the Messiah that's a luciferian title

01:03:51.599 --> 01:04:01.160
I'll leave it at that attained true gnosis hail Satan

01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:11.310
[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:21.389
[Applause] [Music]
