oh look I'm not cruel you know there's no

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.840
way to do this better than to take along a child of God

and to have them attempt to entice you to go into the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.640
fairy tale backyard it's usually in the back or it's in the Crypt right it's a space

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.939

Reverend Renner um his distinguished one

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.980
um we're looking at his work because he has had the to you know the real courage

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.540
to step forward and say who is this naked kid with Jesus in The Garden of

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.900
Gethsemane so we catch we catch him there Mr Runner but we think that we're going to get an

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.599
explanation I'll tell you be careful we're gonna go behind the building or into the Crypt

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.360

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.879
let's bring him up let's bring him up let's uh let's have a response to this fella we're going to do this in little

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.040
tiny Clips hit it somebody guess somebody was immense it covered nearly

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.180
the whole slope of the Mount of Olives what we call The Garden of Gethsemane was much more than just trees it was a

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.879
cemetery there were Graves yeah first of all the name Gethsemane

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.340
they'll tell you right the first thing he's going to tell you he hasn't done it yet but he will he's going to tell you

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.440
that this is from the Aramaic and it means the place of the oil press well no

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.379
if it's from the Greek it means the pleasure stones

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:55.379
the pleasure stands and that word for Stones this is a district this is a district in a Park area

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:01.080
where there are things like cemeteries monuments

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.840
yeah nice love it anyway um and part of this is called the place

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.819
if it's in the Greek it's the place of the stone pleasure it's a place that we know that Jesus

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:22.019
hung out it's a place that we know that Jesus hung out okay let's keep that let's keep

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.759
that in mind okay hit him again bring him again and Jesus came into the grotto to pray regularly with his Apostles and

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.800
it was there that Jesus spoke the words I am he and the Bible tells us in John

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.960
chapter 18 that all the soldiers who came to arrest him when they heard those

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.160
words I am he they begin to do something very strange all those soldiers begin to go backward

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:55.620
and the King James version says they fell to the ground okay so here we are we're in the garden

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.780
and foreign a group

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.940
group comes up these are not regular

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:14.280
forces yeah these are heavily armed members of the cohort

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.840
yeah yeah now there's no indication of how many of them came he drew from the cohort though to bring

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.620
it so we've got Temple security we've got Civic local Civic forces and we've

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.280
got um a crack group these are the guys you send for the Big

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:43.080
Bus anyway um so uh here they come here they come

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.500
and Pilots uh Judas is let them there fantastic now it's gonna get a little

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.720
bit dark from here it's going to get a little bit dark from here he's going to tell us something happened these

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:03.000
soldiers suddenly got drowsy okay now we're going behind the building

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.720
yeah now we are come on kids yeah you've got to know this

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:17.160
you don't know what his skill is he can tell you it's

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.900
because the ancient Greek says it's that way and let me tell you something he he is

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.919
lying through his teeth

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:34.080
let's just look at what the Greek says yeah okay hit us another clip please you

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.500
read the Greek the words go backward really means to wobble to stumble they lost their

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.900
bearing and when the Bible says they fell it's the Greek word Pepto which means to fall hard

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:53.699
Jesus released such a blast of divine power when he said those words I am he which

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:59.580
in Greek literally mean I am yeah the um

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:06.479
he set off wait I'm just wait okay that's when you realize it's dark

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:11.639
you know and you're in the basement you're like what are we doing down here

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:20.160
right how many of us have found ourselves in this Edition right what are we doing here Jesus let

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:27.419
off a what Jesus had a blast of what that's what the text says believe you

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:32.639
because you said you do the Greek that's what the text says really

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:38.099
really let's go to them let's go to the John 15

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:44.039
please or 18. this is John 18. this is the text that he's talking about

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:49.280
yeah good look at starting at six horse

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:55.680
ego Amy um that's the that's the ego the ego Amy

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.080
is the response right so in the world of the basement the fairy tale they will

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.979
tell you Jesus spoke out Boom Like A you know it's kind of just magic everybody

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:13.500
falls down it gets better just wait it gets better

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:19.080
but that's not what the Greek says that's not what the Greek says they don't bring the Greek up again

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.240
what does it say ago Amy why is he saying Eggo any saying I am because they

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.960
asked him are you Jesus of Nazareth and he says because it's a it's a crowd

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:37.740
of a delegate of soldiers right this is a he they brought out the unit that

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:44.039
takes down the real bad guys they're heavily armed right we're going to see this Jesus

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:49.080
makes a note of this he says something out of his own mouth out of his own

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.839
mouth tonight we have first-hand evidence right we've been trying to establish a

00:08:54.839 --> 00:09:02.760
motive here for Jesus and there are those of you who have been saying you know it's not things are not so bad

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.820
right we have to understand here that we can we can get rid of the religiosity

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:14.100
but we can't get rid of that core let's look at the core

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:19.500
I have no arguments for you I have no opinions I have no you can quote me as

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:25.440
saying nothing that thou should do or not do anything yeah

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:31.740
here we serve the text baby this is the museum we serve the text let's look at

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:37.580
what that text says John bring him up excellent thank you so much

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:48.300
I yeah so they said are you Jesus he said I am and it says they went around to his

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.519
back they circled them they were around him

00:09:53.519 --> 00:10:02.040
so they couldn't get away they fell on him they attacked the Greek

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:10.140
uses for falling all the time all the time the one enemy falls upon another

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:17.580
you know so they surround him and they take him they start to arrest him they grabbed him right and as they're

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:23.100
going for him Jesus says yeah

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:30.360
let's go to the next text this is this is uh okay yeah this is the one from Mark yeah

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.700
so um yeah ah as they cut as they go so

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:41.700
they're around them and they're getting they're they're you know the arrest is being made the arrest is being made

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:48.899
they've identified who he is and they're taking him down and what happens

00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:56.519
Jesus responds to them right as they're coming on to him he says what what if you come out here with your swords and

00:10:56.519 --> 00:11:02.880
with your clubs that's the military club right it's a big thing that's that's a big deal they came out with battering

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.399
rams this time and flash grenades right they came out and what did they what

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:15.600
what did they say look at the the end of the first line Hoss look at the two first words the next

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:21.240
line Epi lay stain go ahead and take it down

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:28.500
you're coming at me as if you're coming against or coming to

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.899
arrest or coming to apprehend a laces

00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:40.220
what is that what is that people like to translate it as robber

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:45.420
robber but that doesn't make it that doesn't quite make it there Jesus says

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:50.459
were these guys so heavily armed for would you come out against me for you

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:56.760
know when you look at your armed resistance would you come out let's look at this look at the transl look at uh

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:03.420
the there we go um here's the definition of lay stay

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:09.899
thrive it's from laids though for those of you who are in Greek right good and

00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:15.240
notice that um they first give you Rob Robert or pirate right and you think to

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.180
yourself wait a minute pirate Jesus is saying what'd you guys come out

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:27.480
here so heavily armed like I'm a pirate right what does that mean well it's

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:33.060
especially somebody at Sea so there's some kind of C connection you know that's where we're getting pirate

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:39.620
brigand Buccaneer right buccaneer later

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:46.260
now you know where you get the word pirate from yeah but what kind of what are these

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:53.339
shiver me timbers these aren't the guys that make Johnny Depp look good this is not that kind of a pirate

00:12:53.339 --> 00:13:00.959
right these are sex traffickers should we bring up that same

00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:06.540
look at the very bottom used by lycophone who is lycophone

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:13.680
lycophone is the poet who is preserving the song of Cassandra

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:22.260
yeah the song Cassandra who is the bakkick Sybil yeah wonderful wonderful and you'll

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:29.220
notice there in that like a frond it's okay you'll notice there in that lycophone that

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:34.880
um we have a reference to child abduction

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:40.860
yeah it turns out in Antiquity I mean let me just lay this thing straight you

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:46.860
want to become the garden of the garden of grave Delight here we are in this

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:54.959
place take a whiff around you know what you smell you smell groups of traffickers who will

00:13:54.959 --> 00:14:02.160
sail into a port jump off the ship armed armed with enough Force to overwhelm the

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:09.240
local authorities and take kidnap take prisoner

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:15.600
um young men and young women boys and girls and if this kind of thing

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:22.260
you know oh why do they take them to take them somewhere and traffic them to sell them right

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:28.620
um yeah to sell them it's not very nice it's not very nice indeed

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:34.260
yes but this is the word the latest this is the word for this trafficker

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:40.800
and so when Jesus says would you come out against me so heavily armed what do you think I am a trafficker

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:46.279
the fact that there's a naked kid standing next to him

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:52.440
the fact that there's a naked kid standing next to him and that verb

00:14:52.440 --> 00:15:01.079
that's used for a company when it says the naked boy was accompanying Jesus that verb is a verb that is used of

00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:08.940
soldiers and of slaves soldiers and of slaves

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:16.139
yeah there was that boy accompanying him naked let's hear what else he has to say

00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:22.980
about the the go ahead Jesus was declaring that he was

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:29.699
God In the Flesh and there was such a blast of power it knocked all the soldiers to the ground

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:36.180
eventually they got up they regained their bearings and Jesus surrendered himself to them

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:43.560
and as they walked out of The Grotto out of the cave through this area the Bible tells us in Mark chapter 14

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:49.560
verses 51 and 52 about something very unusual it says suddenly there appeared

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:57.959
in the midst of them a naked boy with a linen cloth who is the naked boy in the

00:15:57.959 --> 00:16:03.360
Garden of Gethsemane who is that naked boy in the Garden of

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:11.519
Gethsemane alas someone is finally talking about it nice job nice job it's

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:18.300
taken us what is this 1400 years we solved it once a long time ago oh

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:26.579
he's a cousin right he's a cousin now okay so let's let's see this whole thing about the

00:16:26.579 --> 00:16:33.180
this whole thing about the we'll come back to the glory bomb in a minute don't play that video the this will come back

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:40.440
to the glory bomb in just a second but the blowing off of the feet you can see it's not even in the text

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:47.579
right and it you'll notice that translators since Tyndale

00:16:47.579 --> 00:16:53.759
have been following this same path so you can track this man Mr renner's

00:16:53.759 --> 00:17:01.980
education you get it down to his education about where he came up with these ideas when he says I am and lets

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:07.918
off the glory bomb causing all the soldiers to fall around right

00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:14.760
and by the way that stuff he said about balance is not in that at all it's not there at all he's making stuff up that's

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:22.079
why I'm saying these are lies he is making stuff up there's nothing to do with staggering in that Greek period

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:28.679
nothing they simply went around and took custody of him right took him down

00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:34.440
yeah yeah it's a bust right it's a bus and they've got a big unit out there

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:40.080
this is fantastic okay hit him again who is the naked boy in the Garden of

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:46.559
Gethsemane why was there a naked boy and why was he carrying a linen cloth well

00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:53.160
the key is the words Lenin cloth it is a Greek word which described a burial shroud

00:17:53.160 --> 00:18:00.600
well All Around The Grotto All Around The Garden of Gethsemane there were Graves including fresh Graves

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.700
this was a dead boy that's why he was carrying a linen cloth or a burial

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.740
shroud the Jews buried their people naked and covered them with that kind of

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:16.799
a shroud this boy was laying in his grave and when Jesus spoke those words I am he

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:22.200
the same power that knocked 300 to 600 soldiers onto

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:29.160
their back apparently touched a dead boy that had recently been buried the boy

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:36.120
came crawling out of his grave with his Lenin cloth stumbles into the midst of the whole

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:41.340
scene that's taking place in the Garden of Gethsemane or here we find the moment

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:48.000
of Jesus arrest okay

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:56.760
so if I got this straight the fairy tale view is Jesus set off a glory bomb

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.799
the soldiers hit the deck and because they were close

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:07.260
to a fresh dead boy he crawled out

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:15.059
of the Grave I mean this is zombies does anybody else see the zombies this man believes in zombies

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:22.620
out comes this boy fantastic let's let's hit him one more time this is just it's overwhelming it's overwhelmingly bad

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:28.919
when this man takes you into the back okay and he starts this act

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:34.020
right um You don't know that his Greek is wrong it is

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:39.720
plainly openly yes okay let's keep let's finish him off

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:45.299
give him one more that was another miracle a periphery Resurrection

00:19:45.299 --> 00:19:51.539
and when the soldiers and the religious leaders saw the resurrected boy they said somebody get that boy because they

00:19:51.539 --> 00:19:57.419
didn't want news of another Resurrection in that very moment

00:19:57.419 --> 00:20:03.480
Jesus power is simply immense it shows up all the time

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:10.100
and today I want to talk to you about Jesus power showing up in your life

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:18.000
yeah and that's how it starts that's how it starts show me on the dolly

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.620
yeah that's how it starts did you hear how he's he's going in there in the end for the huh he's going in this is the

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:31.620
hunt right he's pre he's preying on you and he's going to come in I want to show

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:38.640
you Jesus power wait a minute you just made up a bunch of nonsense

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:46.320
right even what he said about the scene done right it is not a burial shroud it is

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:51.360
not the word for burial shroud it's the word for linen strip it's just a piece

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.700
of linen cloth that's all it's a piece of linen cloth

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:03.600
yeah and if this guy had had five minutes to read some Galen

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.960
he might see how these linen bandages work

00:21:09.539 --> 00:21:17.760
yeah yeah the kid runs off naked Jesus is Calling himself a child sex trafficker

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:24.000
the people that show up oh by the way for those of you who want a little more context by the way with the child sex

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.460
trafficking in antiquity there we go with the child sex

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:37.500
trafficking in Antiquity um sometimes it can get kind of formalized and when the Pirates show up

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:44.280
you have a certain number of you know teens that they need to be given

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:49.500
yeah and that keeps them from coming back then they only come back once a year

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:55.980
right and the mothers in the in Antiquity are singing about these things

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:02.039
yeah about how terrible it is you know to be taken in those captive

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:08.159
and to have your child rip from you in order to enter into this

00:22:08.159 --> 00:22:14.460
Garden of delight you know where these kids are sold off

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.980
yeah it's a big um abduction and abduction for the

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:26.220
purposes of sexual abuse is a very prominent industry in Antiquity so when

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:33.539
Jesus calls himself a trafficker he's noticing as you see he's pointing

00:22:33.539 --> 00:22:39.240
clearly pointing out you've got the weapons right you brought the specialized unit

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:44.700
right and this guy says 600 right because he thinks when the Greek says he

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.880
went to the cohort he thinks he got every person in the unit

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:56.940
no he didn't right and they didn't fall down because of the glory bomb where

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:03.000
don't we have some look I we're trying to make a you know representation of this thing

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.460
hit it should we see if it works is this phone

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:16.200
[Music] [Applause]

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.960
um foreign

00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:31.740
fantastic I don't know if that captured it I don't know if that captured it and before we move on to our serious ending

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:38.039
I do need a moment of subliminal Zane do you have just a moment of subliminal Zane

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:43.860

I hope you like what I'm doing with it um thank you very much

00:23:57.299 --> 00:24:02.700
what do we do with that Glory bomb right so we're in a situation now where look

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:09.840
guys we have an option we can't I can't keep taking you back to these scenes and

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:15.900
exposing you to them without it seriously affecting us all

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:21.059
right so we have to understand we have to we have to get it clear that we're

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:27.480
talking about a time and a place and very specific things very specific

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:33.480
historical events and the only thing that we can trust

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:38.640
is the language the language preserves this

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:44.580
the language preserves what the actual statement was that Jesus made he said

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:51.360
you're arresting me he said well what you're arresting me like I'm a

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:58.140
pirate of people you know like I'm a sex trafficker

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:03.960
so known accomplices

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:09.679
prostitutes and accountants

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:18.260
arrested in a public park at 4am with a naked boy

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.940
armed resistance was provided

00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:34.260
so we think we've come to the place that Jesus regularly hangs out where he does his Biz you don't see him

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:39.480
doing any carpentry do you right but he is hanging out with

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:46.820
prostitutes and accountants with naked boys

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:53.279
in places that we know are the necromancers

00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:59.100
hang just place to hang all right he's waiting there for the

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:07.020
dawn he's waiting there for the dawn you know the you know the process

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:13.799
of trading children in antiquity is directly connected

00:26:13.799 --> 00:26:20.159
with cult mystery are you surprised

00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:27.059
you shouldn't be Jehovah has this Ganymede right we understand this

00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:33.320
so we provide Jesus

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:39.960
it looks like we've got enough evidence to say that there is a direct

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:48.679
Association between Jesus aka the Christ

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:55.039
and the sex trade

00:26:55.679 --> 00:27:02.340

Baptists and we find The Free Church of Christ

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.940
and the holy Immaculate nationalist Association of

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:17.580
we're going to take over the world when we find them taking people into places

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:25.860
where they they're taking advantage of them it's our duty to stand up to that

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:32.700
yeah so so far what we've got I wanted to show you a little bit of the prophecy of

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:40.080
Cassandra and I wanted you to see there's a lovely um there's some lovely imagery there and

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:46.380
some talk of what you can do with your daughters you can dedicate your daughters to the

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:51.600
temple and they'll be protected and we as members of the community who worship

00:28:51.600 --> 00:29:00.900
hackity and protect those virgins um we take up weapons Stones bows

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:09.320
against those pirates who we catch with our children naked

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:15.059
it turns out the chief pirate

00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:18.500
is the son of God

get your hands off and parents were saying get your hands off them all right stop touching my children

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:33.419
that's what people told Jesus he was like don't scandalize me

00:29:33.419 --> 00:29:39.960
yeah maybe that's what it is when the priest Is We I just want to

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:46.500
finish with gazier when the priest at his ordination

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:52.559
sees the vampires and knows the beauty

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:59.820
he gains a perspective and he can never go back

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:06.179
his God's righteousness turns into oppressive pain

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:12.779
