you want some Homer I'll give you some Homer yeah love it oh you strangers who

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:06.320
the who are you who the heck are you where'd you come from on the sailing the

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:13.279
sea right right um You you here to do something or are you just wandering

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:20.799
without a reason that's the second line yeah and then on the third line if you'll notice the third word in is

00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:27.320
leus leus he says are you like those pirates

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:34.600

souls and they cause strangers great pain man great

00:30:40.919 --> 00:30:46.720
evil why because even when this song was being

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.679
composed even at that time in archaic Greece even at that time long before

00:30:52.679 --> 00:30:58.120
Classical Greece and democracy at that time the world

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:06.600
was under the control and influence of gangs of gangs Highway robbers and when

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:12.559
you say Highway robber you think yeah put up your hands no I'm gonna kill you and I'm gonna take

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:19.080
your children and sell them to the next town because they aren't that bad

00:31:19.159 --> 00:31:25.320
looking this is the group to which Jesus

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:33.840
himself Associates his name when he says I am not one of

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.120
these who thought you were one of those Jesus maybe it was the 200 soldiers that

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:45.279
showed up they're going to break up your

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:53.799
gang the only thing you got bro listen look at how unprepared he was only thing he got is three dudes um three teenage

00:31:53.799 --> 00:32:00.000
boys one of them is the head pimp and that that kid has got a sword and he's

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.639
not very good with it right yeah he's not very good with it at

00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:14.080
all you thought all those soldiers fell on the ground and then got up again that's not what Greek says it says they

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:19.320
took Jesus down and he's screaming not a

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:26.799
pirate would you come out here all the weapons let's get it back

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:33.840

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:40.279
thank you for being here with me this whole time it's very you know love it I

00:32:40.279 --> 00:32:45.960
can smell it in the air I love it um yeah and what happened um yeah so they

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:52.440
make him a crown they make him a crown from The Acacia Thorn and they put on

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:58.639
him um this this purple Ro

00:32:58.639 --> 00:33:04.840
yeah you say why would they do that that's kind of odd why are they doing that right this is the one that we've

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:10.240
got here look at that what we're going to do to him he's not wearing bad clothes either go go back up to the next

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:16.480
one and um what what where we gonna where does nonas take this nonas takes

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:23.840
this look at the second line um it says Jesus's estheti close they W they're

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:32.679
died with the hati KLU KLU do you know what that KLU is

00:33:32.679 --> 00:33:40.360
there that last word that is that sea murex that shell that little shell

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:45.799
creature that is the MX that's why they're purple because they're dyed this

00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:52.840
this these they're soaked the clothes are soaked in that hati K and do you

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:58.880
know if you look this up in Greek you'll find that it equals

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:04.279
Kos it's a flippy dippy of two

00:34:04.279 --> 00:34:10.358
consonants but culus is the place that it is because of this collection process

00:34:10.359 --> 00:34:15.560
because of this whole harvesting of the purple and what you can do with the

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:21.760
burning purple yes right so they're giving them a hard time they're giving

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:28.839
them a hard time and again we're here for associates so let's try to pick up we got the is still not revealed right

00:34:28.839 --> 00:34:34.440
if it was you got to give your get your money back for your ticket you guys

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:41.358

Black Sea down into what you and I call Syria and all the way over to Babylon

from cyan it's the way the cians

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:35.599

morons um none none of this impacts them n this radiation that we're feeling none

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:08.040
of this impacts them why did they have to close the cannon why did they have to establish an

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:13.280
Orthodoxy they had to pair all of the connections that were

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:19.359

sentence those two women who were there those two women are active in the

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:41.440
mystery those two women are the ones who are creating the sons of God and of

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:46.520
course they are one of them is the Maga the other one is the Bride of

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:52.400
God this is classical Bronze Age

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:58.280
mystery and Jesus Christ is wrapped up right in the middle and if it weren't

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:05.000
for those Magi who came speaking their Assyrian or seran

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:14.079
terms Jesus would never be where he is now yeah his entire life is a controlled

00:50:14.079 --> 00:50:19.680
setup yeah yeah you got to be born into it think of it as privilege people you

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:26.240
got to be born into it and Jesus was born into it at the top

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:34.000
at the top yeah it's quite a market quite a market isn't it okay go um go

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.440
back we're finishing off yep go to that one and he says hey he says you know

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:47.119
take her anyway it's get goes on for a second to say you know he took he he he he ended up um following Jesus's

00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:55.799
instructions but then it says at the bottom this is nonis again it says and this kid is asoros he's an aspor oros

00:50:55.799 --> 00:51:03.000
whe he's an unseated son wait OS sporos yeah he's an unseated

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:09.640
son this blessed God child we're talking about John we're talking about

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:17.400
John this kid is not going to be a breeder yeah this kid is not going to be

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:24.480
a breeder he is a person who has been brought to the

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:30.720
world without out the birthing wait what he is one who is

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:36.960
not his his mother did not enter into the pain wait a minute I thought God

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:44.400
kicked Eve out so she would have the pain of child birth yes because it's a drug it's a compound when I say drug not

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:53.000
a single drug but a compound and it allows you to enter into that state to produ the God child and that state is a

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:59.160
state of painlessness revolutionary let somebody pick that up for Obstetrics and

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:06.880
Gynecology did you know it's better to put your patient into a state where they are completely relaxed and where they

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:13.760
are not feeling pain while they're delivering yeah and you put them into this not quite before coma it's a little

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:19.559
bit before coma before that right you pull them out you put them into this kind of

00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:25.680
Slumber it's not really asleep but you put them into this painless state and

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:32.240
from that they bring out the child they bring that God child where do you think they're getting the drugs for this it's

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:39.319
what the MD doll does what do you think that Maga does that's her you say wait a

00:52:39.319 --> 00:52:44.400
minute I told you the Greek used a duel a

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:49.400
duel for those two and their

00:52:49.839 --> 00:52:57.160
