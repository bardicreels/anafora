00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:36.720
the offerings of a dead Mage a dead mogas who washed ashore recently

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.840
um he's been dead for almost 2 000 years but he was put on trial

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.860
he was put on trial for magic and uh it turned out well he he came through okay

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.420
he ended up writing a whole bunch of stuff and um yeah I just want to resurrect his

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.079
words this is a prayer and this is a prayer like I am sure you have never heard

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.259

phoebus's sister who brought forth populist multitudes

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.660

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.440
roam through widely scattered Groves and are propitiated by diverse rights

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.799
you who illumine every city with your womanly light I told you you never heard

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.140
a prayer like this nourish the joyous seeds with your moist

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.400

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.060
that's the prayer um

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.079
tonight we're going to try to penetrate into the a world that it's hard to

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.900
believe exists there's a shock to it you won't understand it it won't feel good it

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.479
won't feel right and that's where we deep we Deep dive so I want to Deep dive

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:40.820
with some real life chemistry and some real life

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.259
serpents and in order to start there we're going to start in order to get there we're

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:53.880
going to start with Travis kitchens Travis kitchens and um Travis which

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.240
would you mind uh uh regaling us a little bit about your background with Kentucky and just lead us into the

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.820
subject Travis when most people think of Kentucky they think of the mountainous region of Kentucky people playing banjos

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.460
the whole tradition of folk music over there uh then there's Central Kentucky which is horses and bourbon then there's

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.220
Western Kentucky which the the Green River cuts right through it I'm from that region of Kentucky so my interest

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:25.139
in uh servant handling Colts does not really come from my background it comes from my uh participation in a study uh

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.720
at Johns Hopkins school of medicine a psychedelic clinical trial and I became interested in the background of these

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.500
studies and the science behind these studies and one of the things I found interesting about them is that um

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.759
most of their footnotes are from comparative religion and the psychology of religion and uh more specifically

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:50.759
William James the main measurement that Hopkins uses the hood mysticism scale was created by a man named Ralph Hood

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:57.000
who's a professor and psychologist at UT Chattanooga and he is an expert in serpent handling cults

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.759
um so so that's how I became interested in him and of course I said oh that's weird I never thought that the Johns

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:09.180
Hopkins psychedelic study you know the history of psychedelic researcher Albert Hoffman and Timothy Leary and all these

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.340
very highly educated um intellectuals and Aristocrats like Aldous Huxley I thought oh there's a

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:21.419
tie-in uh to what I perceived as uh Prim sort of semi-premitive religious cults

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.639
uh from Appalachia

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:32.400
semi-premitive religious cults do you feel where we landed boom got a little

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.340
dust up in her you can smell it semi-premitive religious cults I bet

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:46.620
these Cults have something to do with music and I'd like to introduce you to somebody who's actually living and

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:53.580
um sings yeah you're going to hear some of the heart you're going to hear some of the

00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:03.000
heart of this old old musty burning purple mystery

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:13.380
yes please one day nothing of this world will

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:21.259
remain to say we were ever here

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:34.160
even our names carved in stone erased one day like we were never here

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.740
oh we live a little while and we're gone

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:46.520
forever leave it up to the left behind

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:55.860
live a little while then we're gone forevermore

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.099
so we've got snakes and we've got old cultural

00:08:07.099 --> 00:08:13.919
conceptions of drugs and animals plants things that you can take into your body

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:19.500
mingled with the idea of ecstasy and

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:26.160
uh uh tell me Travis can we just take these atheists and tie them and Drug

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.279
them you know these studies produce all kinds of weird experiences they've done it you

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:37.979
know let me give you one they've done a informal survey study but they published a paper on it

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:44.339
um that showed that 90 of atheists who took psychedelics after one experience

00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:50.040
weren't atheists anymore uh this is this this is dismaying too many of the

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.380
Psychedelic researchers because it makes people essentially believe in Supernatural things you have lots of

00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:01.380
alien Alien Encounter experiences alien entity experiences um

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:09.000
uh telepathy many people there's reports of telepathy um out of body experiences

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.920
um speaking to dead relatives um it's the whole Panorama of Supernatural experiences so so the

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:23.339
answer to your question is they're having a whole lot of trouble separating those things from the therapeutic

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:28.560
experience because it seems to be that this experience of God is the

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.080
therapeutic benefit so we can bring therapy

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:40.860
we this is fantastic look what we've got we've got the cult up and running

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:46.440
um there's a great great psychoanalyzing

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:53.040
trauma healing Warrior uh with a Dr in front of his name and an

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.320
expertise in Jung and I thought I would add his quote of the day at this point

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.779
just to tie everything together and this is in the context this is in the context

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:09.839
of us discussing the treatment the treatment of

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:16.080
um the modern mind the treatment of the Soul right

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:23.519
um I would have given you the Water of Life and this is what we're discussing because John is right on the frontier of

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:29.779
that and he's writing he's in a think tank he's right in there he knows what he's doing and

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:37.800
where are we John what can we do go ahead yeah you can't just give some someone

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:45.480
her math or did it sex juice that's a lot that says a lot

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:53.160
that says a lot yeah where are we in Bible studies we

00:10:53.160 --> 00:11:00.839
are in The Apocalypse of John and don't get your pants in a bunch if I tell you

00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:07.740
that this thing was never written by a man could not have been written by a man and uh will be shown not to have been

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:16.399
written by a man it was written by a Sybil it was composed it's music

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:22.800
and we're gonna go dance with the dragon and see what that has to do with the

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.839
order of the Rose um but before we do I want to thank I I

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:34.140
want to thank Travis but um uh

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:40.260
I want to thank Travis for reaching out to artists

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:46.980
um who are buried and who uh try to honor the Muse this way remember

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:52.920
we're not all of us are here because because of the Muse you can't come to

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:59.700
this templum this Sacred Space that we have constructed without following the

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:06.839
Muse uh so so thank you Travis um we're talking about a rose and the

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:13.019
order thereof yeah the order of the Rose

00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:21.420
we're going to start and end up with in the same place and that that place starts with a romance and it ends with

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:29.700
sappho on the Island of Lesbos yeah and the power of this Goddess that

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:36.839
we just prayed to and and I wanted that to stick in your minds because that is a

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:42.620
is a prayer that you wouldn't you wouldn't necessarily

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:49.380
uh associate with today in the midst of our modern culture Global the whole

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:56.399
thing um so I want to shock you into the common

00:12:56.399 --> 00:13:04.079
place in antiquity where it doesn't seem odd that we have a

00:13:04.079 --> 00:13:10.339
female that we are recognizing as the

00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:18.540

cattle when they come into estrus wait a minute did somebody say estrus

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.480

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:07.740
wow it must be quite a place to be taken

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:14.760

to be full to bursting to be plump especially of a woman's breasts

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:10.740
so the idea of the life there the nourishment the generation the beginning

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:16.500

or strength that bloom the idea of the bloom is in this word it's in this root system

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:05.220
that's following the org roots and it's the idea of the budding to completion

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:10.559
kind of a cycle of life right the efflorescence of the beauty

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:18.059
is there the budding of the rose right blossoming nice I'm looking number four

00:27:18.059 --> 00:27:26.640
swell with desire or again to be at heat so specifically the period of estrus and

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:33.840
why is it that we are so interested in the estrus because that is

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.120
um everything within the cult that is the Morning Star let's go back to our

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.960
text um I've told I told you from last week I want to make sure that you understand

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:51.840
that the throne because I want you to to be able to facilitate your initiation into the

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:58.980
satanic um way saturnian way and in in order to do that

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:04.799
you really need to understand the direction that you're going you're going to

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:12.120
unravel to find out what that source is from the various bottom and you're going to work with that source to build what

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:18.120
is the real right it's um it's a complete reason is

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:24.240
all that we can have to guide us bring us back to the text please Chewie

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:31.639
mm-hmm yes so what happened uh verse 17.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:41.400
so he did that orge on her right good

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:49.260
good good good good good good okay okay so and then he goes on to make war

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:56.159
with seed um so where are we

00:28:56.159 --> 00:29:03.299
um how do we find uh the meaning behind

00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:10.080
what he's saying with this with this woman and um this

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.659
dracon what is the original right so

00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:21.720
um we're not looking at the fiction we don't want the fairy tale side we want the the real side

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:28.200
so I showed you for just a minute I showed you the reference to the goddess

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:35.159
who relieves the Pains of birth I showed you that and I want us to

00:29:35.159 --> 00:29:40.580
realize that the estrus or the oistress

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:47.460
is that chemical it's the it's the concrete real bond that we have with

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:53.279
this history is that chemical the worshipers of Diana

00:29:53.279 --> 00:30:00.179
um who was one of this Great Goddess that we all are drawn to who we'll call

00:30:00.179 --> 00:30:07.080
Dawn and we'll say that Lucifer's job is to bring that Dawn

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:14.520
to you to bring her wisdom is out in the street she's crying out there saying if you

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:22.620
take me in I'll stay with you fantastic uh so here we are with the

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:28.320
here we are with the dragon and the estrus the oistress so

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:36.539
um we are all engaging in something that is developed and supported by the images that are

00:30:36.539 --> 00:30:45.539
being generated by women who are in this way

00:30:45.539 --> 00:30:52.580
and these women can burn off your mortality

00:30:52.679 --> 00:30:57.799
okay you can enter into a state

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:04.559
through a combination of music or song they say or the song is the most

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:10.500
important element in combination with Pharmaceuticals

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:17.039
to interact with the Risen

00:31:17.039 --> 00:31:22.100
form they called it the Risen form

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:29.460
and that's why we're all here in the apocalypse right what do you think that what did you think was being revealed

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:36.179
right would you yeah an apocalypse is a revelation it's a revelation and with

00:31:36.179 --> 00:31:43.320
that the stroke of 7 30 comes and I I just want to leave you with an

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.779
impression um with an impression

00:31:48.779 --> 00:31:54.059
yeah as as we progress I want you to be

00:31:54.059 --> 00:32:00.240
able to sit on the throne what what does that mean the Throne of

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:06.659
Satan what is the Throne of Satan you can watch a thousand shows you can watch a

00:32:06.659 --> 00:32:12.659
thousand shows you can watch a thousand episodes on YouTube all about The Throne

00:32:12.659 --> 00:32:18.840
of Satan and none of them are correct none of them

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:24.779
tonight I offer you shut up young I offer you

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:31.860
the Throne of Satan it what is the Throne of Satan it is the

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:38.460
place from which the satanic power is

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:47.000
exercised it is the star

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:54.559
and if you draw down the star

00:32:55.559 --> 00:33:02.720
you can use the images provided by the Dead

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.398
to be born again

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:15.480
you know you asked about magic last week and and wanting to do the magic

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:21.240
until you are sitting on that Throne the physics are explained this way when it

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:28.140
gets into physics I get sort of Lost but the makeup the of the universe is

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:35.519
such that their compartments I know zones yeah and in these zones one of

00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:45.019
them is called the Wilderness in Greek that is where the power of the saturnian

00:33:45.019 --> 00:33:52.980
Reigns Reigns in the wilderness so anytime you see somebody pulled from

00:33:52.980 --> 00:34:00.059
uranos which we see in the apocalypse 12 pulled from Uranus

00:34:00.059 --> 00:34:06.779
and shot into the wilderness

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:16.260
then um you're seeing a an explanation an analog of uh how the

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:24.240
physics work between the two Dimensions that are overlapping okay and I can't go there

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:32.638
um yeah um but what I can do is tell you how they presented this is accessible to you

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:41.220
right because we're all here obviously if you're listening to me is anybody not here yeah yeah

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:47.460
um but in the eremon in that Wilderness and uh we'll see that come up

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:55.940
um uh you are have certain rulers in certain places this is again analog right

00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:01.740
so you have certain rulers in certain places and Lucifer

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:09.380
is the ruler of this world

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:15.599
your access to that Authority cut and that power

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:22.079
more like October toss but anyway that power comes through the star I am

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:28.200
telling you what the texts have told me through the Muse it comes through

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:34.140
asterian that's how the oistress

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:41.280
allows us to become oyster Maniacs looking for Historia

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:46.320
yeah it's gorgeous so

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.540
um for those of you who have ears to hear you will understand

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:59.280
