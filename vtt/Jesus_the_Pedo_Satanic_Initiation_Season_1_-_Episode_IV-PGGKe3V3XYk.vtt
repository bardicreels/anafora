you here with me tonight and we have an excellent show we have a guest tonight

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:01.239
in the form of Dr Carl Ruck who will be addressing a couple of

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:09.360
questions we will also have a a visit from uh a ghost of the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:20.560
past and introduce you this is the first in our series on meeting P pedo

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:38.290
Jesus [Music]

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.759
tonight I want to start out with kind of a look on the inside I want to just briefly describe for you a situation um

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.680
imagine a couple of Scholars a couple of professors a couple of professionals um

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.119
trying to find out what's going on with uh these ancient texts and what they're

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.399
saying and what they're talking about we're trying to figure this out

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:10.840
um it's difficult remember we're always as satanus you're always on the edge

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.959
you're right where that ceiling is you're right at that Borderland right that right at that threshold so we want

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.840
to know about all these deep dark crevices that will allow us to throw off

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.640
this glass ceiling um imagine Daryl Bach

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.959
yes Dr Daryl Bach who's Dr darl Bach um this is Dr Daryl Bach and it's

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:47.159
it's uh nice to meet you throw him up there in his face needs to go there he's a premier uh expert in New

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:55.280
Testament um particularly the Greek um he is a master at the Greek and he is uh

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.319
the head wizard at Dallas Theological Seminary for the ancient Greek program

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.519
yeah for the New Testament Greek program I sent him an email um I was working on

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:15.840
a followup to the chemical Muse and I sent him an email and this is the email that I sent

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.040
him Dr Bach I'm I'll read this to you now Dr Bach I am Dr DC alen Hillman

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.280
author of the chemical Muse St Martin's press 2008 my area of expertise is

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:36.159
ancient medicine pharmacology and the use of pH euticals in mystery cult from the late bronz to Imperial Rome I work

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:43.000
with both the Greek and Latin and I'm a bit fond of the Linear B I'm writing to you to ask for your

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.280
textual Insight I'm working on a book about the use of drugs in mystery ritual

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:58.079
and found numerous sources that reference the use of sexual stimulants by Jesus and his Apostles the PGM and

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.200
nus in his paraphrase of John discussed the specific

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.319
drugs Galen and scribonius largus confirm their sacramental use and some

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:15.120
interesting data on the use of antidotes to treat any negative side effects it

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.199
turns out these drugs were popular Viper Venom based compounds used by the pagans

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:29.639
in their own Mystery rights what is really curious is that one specific compound which sources a

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.080
tribute to the Christians is used in sexual rights involving the ritual rape

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.080
of young boys the priest of this cult was called quote the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:48.160
pedophile and followed the elosan type mystery celebrated in both Greece and

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.720
Italy based on Resurrection Jesus was of course

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:01.680
arrested in the company of a naked minor who possessed at the time a medicated wrap you may know already but on the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.199
medical side of the Greek the linen wrap referenced by Mark is a drug impregnated

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:13.960
bandage used in religious ritual and Medicine it was a popular Avenue of

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.639
applying drugs the sources including even the Roman

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.479
juvenile connected the use of drug induced ritual with the Baptists and

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.759
their use of the wo priapo

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:36.000
if you have time I'd like to ask if you have noticed

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.240
Jesus ever using religious Expressions consistent with meic orphic bakic

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.440
cult AO Kar editor of the orphic fragments called the oric language the

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.240
Vox Ora it was an ancient means of conveying cult sensitive material for

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.759
example the having ears to hear is a pagan expression using the oric mystery

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:07.800
to delineate those who have been initiated or baptized and can therefore understand

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.440
the true content of the speaker are you aware of any work on Jesus using orphic

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.960
or meic Expressions thank you for your

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:27.960
time that is one that is that is one academic with

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:36.000
titles approaching another academic with titles saying what is going on um I

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.560
sent this message to

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:48.919
27 of the leading Premier Scholars um most of which were ended up

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:55.400
being classicists um uh with training in the language because I know that's the

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:02.280
evidence we're working with so if you don't do the languages you're making stuff up right that's just the that's

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:10.280
just the way it is um yeah so uh um I sent it out and Dr Bach very nicely sent

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:17.879
me a response like many people did um and it was short and to the point

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:24.960
can we bring up Dr Box's response almond all very strange and hardly

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:32.639
historical you're wasting my time and yours darl Bach now interestingly enough

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:40.400
you'll notice at the bottom keep it up there chewy at the bottom look at his his titles are longer than my response

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:47.240
was senior research Professor now darl Bach you're the senior research

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:53.759
Professor right of New Testament studies if anybody should know these

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:59.919
sources you should know these sources Dallas Theological Seminary

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:05.879
executive director for cultural engagement from the Hendrick Center DTS

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:13.400
Dallas Theological Seminary in case you didn't pick that up before um yeah uh uh

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.759
these sources I can assure you are historical they exist they're real and

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:24.360
that's what we're looking at so there you can see Can You Feel the ceiling of

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:30.000
where the mind can't go there's a limit there's a mental limit there

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.080
now that was the bad example of scholarly interaction the

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:42.919
good example is Dr Carl Ruck Dr Carl Ruck and I know that most of you will

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:50.000
know Dr Carl Ruck what do I think you should know about him besides the fact

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:59.880
that he's in he's a genius um who is a skilled master

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.959
at the highest level of the ancient Greek and

00:09:05.959 --> 00:09:13.720
has has jumped into the deep deep depths of the ancient

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:21.640
sources and knows he's forgotten more Greek than um any seminarian in this

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:28.760
country has learned I can guarantee you that anyway Dr Ruck um I want to run a couple of

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.360
clips Dr Ru now what I did was I asked him the same difficult types of

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:40.800
questions but he has studied the ancient cult so he's not following the fairy

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.839
tale right where we we're not allowed to these are our this is our gym jungle gym

00:09:46.839 --> 00:09:52.200
and this is where we play right everything set up nicely no he's able to

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:59.920
say well you know what do the sources say and where can we go um you know he he might get accused of being a Satanist

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:06.079
um because He follows reason um and so let's just go ahead and run under asking

00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:13.240
some diff difficult questions Carl Rock would you would you give us some answers of uh the beauty of the world go ahead

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:19.680
Ron Carl what I think is most important of my about my work and what I find most

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:28.079
interesting is uncovering the uh the pattern of metaphors that

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:35.079
describe the sacred uh Sacrament and once you have uncovered

00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:41.360
that it's really quite simple and quite obvious why these metaphors existed but

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:48.320
since they are metaphors they've been interpreted in entirely different way by people who are unaware of the fact that

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.360
the Ancients were into altered Consciousness by the use of of of

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.600
psychoactive Sacrament or an anthen mythology is filled with

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:08.079
uh Cows and Bulls um but not ordinary Cows and Bulls because they're bulls that ad duct

00:11:08.079 --> 00:11:15.800
maidens and maidens that have a passion for Bulls uh and so it has nothing to do

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.480
with the fact that well Everyone likes to Stak dinner or they did herd

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:28.120
animals um we're talking about sexual encounter with Bulls which is not an

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:36.600
ordinary expectable experience bulls do not want to copulate with with women and women do

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:45.839
not want to have sex with Bulls so sex with bulls and yes

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:51.800
it it's not difficult then to jump to the looking at the Mysteries and

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:57.360
pedophilia then is it no Carl rock is is

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:05.519
um not afraid to discuss the background let's see another bit and and staring Us

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:14.760
in the face all along is the fact that um the Bine is metaphor for the mushroom

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:22.320
it shouldn't it shouldn't be has have been something that that we

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:28.600
uh didn't know for such a long time says very clearly in the mythical tradition

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:36.480
we have the tradition that pereus uh who uses a pruning hook which

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.959
is not a A Warrior's weapon cuts off the head

00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:47.519
of the gorbon Medusa and he does this at the site of

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:52.560
minini uh and and that uh he picked for

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.519
the for the side of missini picked a mushroom so the the Gorgon head and the

00:12:58.519 --> 00:13:05.199
mushroom room and the founding of the city are clearly defined

00:13:05.199 --> 00:13:10.519
as occurring with the picking of a mushroom the city is supposedly called

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:15.600
after that uh I mean I guess I'm I'm wandering a bit when I'm almost

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.680
embarrassed to to say it where does mushroom come from uh you can trace it

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:29.440
back and it is an an animat poetic zoomorphism of a bellowing uh

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:37.959
ban it's a musroom now that that man is free to say that

00:13:37.959 --> 00:13:45.760
today um when he first was looking at this years ago and he noticed that

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.839
discovered that the elisian Mysteries were involving

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:56.360
drugs um he wasn't well received um his

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:03.000
research was kind of uh yeah great you know it's great is you can't ignore his

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.320
genius right because it's a language it's like the it's why he can play the piano so well right it's a skill and he

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:15.639
does that with the Greek and so he's not afraid of talking um about bringing

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:22.800
these uh Concepts forward so now fast forward in the present and we have now

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:28.040
the Psychedelic Renaissance in which the Physicians have finally caught up and

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:33.800
now all of a sudden there's a a regrowth of interest um and he doesn't sound like

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.240
such a lunatic right if we had stayed where Bach was trying to put us we would

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:44.800
stay with that very comfortable framework of reality that is an

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:53.120
unreality so the job of the Satanist is to bring you that which opens your eyes

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.279
to reality um we where do we get the

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:03.920
connection with the pedophilia in Antiquity please Dr

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:13.440
R the sexual collection of seeming can only can only be accomplished by

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:20.040
masturbation and so it may be a

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:25.199
similar procedure that was used to to collect the menes which would mean that

00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:30.360
the collection process was some kind of organ

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:38.079
yeah nice which is of course why mishel

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:44.800
includes the in this French history includes the the Satanic ritual of

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:52.000
collecting in a tripod the ejaculation of Satan's

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.279
bride yes yes um makes great sense um

00:15:57.279 --> 00:16:03.959
could you tell us um if we wanted to go deep into it because Dr Rock we are

00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:10.759
looking here for um uh uh the the boy

00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:18.079
that was with Jesus in the public park at 400 a who was and he was naked um

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:24.040
we're looking for that boy we want to know what is that boy doing with Jesus

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:31.000
there you you wrote a lot about ejaculate and milks sacred milks and

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.680
whatnot could you just say something about the the Ancient messiness Ancient

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:44.720
messiness Ancient you know yeah give it a um what's that stuff

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:52.120
on the top of the mushroom you lick it off and it's real you know what I mean

00:16:53.480 --> 00:17:00.480
yeah I don't know what I want to talk about these things

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:08.240
[Music] all right so everybody has a limit

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:14.760
everybody has a limit but um not me and so I want to find out I want to look at

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:20.520
what's going on I want to find I want to introduce you to pedo Jesus I want to

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:26.240
introduce you to A Jesus that you do not know but a real Jesus and the way that

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:32.440
we're going to start there in this series of sabbah is we are going to

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:38.480
bring you um Jesus's Associates who are these people that are around him the

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:44.039
important ones right um we're looking at a crime scene and we're trying to figure

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:51.080
out uh when the posi showed up and arrested him and there was the fight and

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:57.840
the three guys that were supposed to keep watch but were in this drug stuper kept

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:04.840
falling as sleep those three guys when they didn't do their job and those cops came in and caught Jesus with the naked

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.039
boy we want to know why he was there why

00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:17.280
the boy was there and what is it in Jesus's background we want to go through all of his friends we want to know who

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.480
were his associates who were his accomplice who made this

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:29.159
possible um what kind of drugs are being used and in order to do that we'll start

00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:36.039
with Mary because look we have Mary Magdalene has the drug connection if

00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:42.520
there's any reason that naked boy is in that garden with Jesus it's because of

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.679
Mary Magdalene she is somehow facilitating this she is facilitating

00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:54.520
this and we know that she is because she gets pardoned she gets pardoned eventually by uh uh Gregory I'll show

00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:01.159
you him in in a minute but um here's what I want to do I want to I I want to

00:19:01.159 --> 00:19:09.400
subject you to some images as uh I work through this very scripted approach to

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:17.520
Mary magdalene's dildo sex drugs priestesses and

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.640
Jesus if I were to present this at a conference that would be the title that

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:29.440
I used Christianity develops in the cultural million of the ancient

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:36.159
Mediterranean where it was directly influenced by numerous Pagan mystery religions Greco Roman priestesses

00:19:36.159 --> 00:19:43.039
oracles and magicians helped shape the image of the early church and ultimately assisted in defining Christian social

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:48.679
identity the gospels report that a number of women including Mary Magdalene

00:19:48.679 --> 00:19:58.360
assisted Jesus and his disciples with support derived from their own personal resources Mary Joanna and Suzanna must

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:03.679
have been fairly welltoo patrons of the Apostles the gospels report that Mary

00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:10.080
possessed expensive drugs frequently used by ancient priestesses and at least

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:16.679
one valuable dildo shaped drug applicator called an

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:24.039
alabastron like the Magi the group of sorcerer priests who gave Jesus parents

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:30.799
an undetermined amount of gold along with two widely used Pharmaceuticals these women were

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:37.960
instrumental in funding his ministry as a miraculous healer and

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:43.720
Exorcist Mary's use of the drug containing alabastron has been a source

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.840
of conation for the church from its

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:57.440
Inception Pope Gregory the Great condemn Mary's use of sex drugs in

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:03.280
the process C of anointing Jesus he also attempted to identify the

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:10.120
naked boy as a cousin this is from homy 33 for those of

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:15.159
you who want to read some dirty dirty stuff Mary's us of the drug containing

00:21:15.159 --> 00:21:22.080
Alabaster has been a source of consternation why it's due to the fact that the very same drugs were used by

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.640
women in orgiastic rights performed within mystery religions that celebrated

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.679
God's like Aphrodite whose temples promoted ritual

00:21:32.679 --> 00:21:39.320
prostitution and bacus whose entheogenic wines were laced with vision inducing

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:47.200
Botanicals and animal Venoms Mary's drugs were also prescribed by midwives

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:54.640
and Physicians to facilitate sexual arousal and to induce abortion the use

00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:02.159
of these drugs and their distinctive paraphernalia implicate Mary Magdalene in the performance of necromantic

00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:07.240
rituals meant to manipulate demons and resurrect the

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.400
dead so now you see now you see kind of

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:21.799
a a workup of the a psychological workup of this person who is a a um

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:29.799
co-conspirator with Jesus okay that's what we're looking at her potentially as a co-conspirator was she involved in

00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:35.799
this naked boy in the Garden of Gethsemane um so that's a that's a look

00:22:35.799 --> 00:22:41.880
at her personal name what her where she is that's her profile what are we going to look at now we're going to look at a

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:49.640
weapon we're going to look at a weapon it's something she carries the

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:55.159
alabastron the canonical gospels all record the same Encounter of Jesus with

00:22:55.159 --> 00:23:01.120
Mary Magdalene at a meal at the home of Simon of Bethany Matthew's version

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.159
succinctly states that Mary showed up with an expensive perfume carried in a

00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:11.600
unique ointment container that was readily recognizable now when Jesus was in

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:18.000
Bethany at the home of Simon the leper a woman came to him with an alabaster vial

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.320
a very costly perfume and she ped on his head as he

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:29.960
reclined at the table as the new American stand right there in

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:36.039
Antiquity the alabastron was a short cylindrical Stone

00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:43.760
container that held ointments applied to the genitals and anus it was shaped like a

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:51.200
Fus as you can see and was roughly the same size as an erect male sexual organ

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.400
Aristophanes famously mocked the alabastron in his Liss Estrada when one

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:04.600
of the characters is sexually frustrated man named kinus was offered an alabastron by his wife meini but refused

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:12.279
to accept it on the grounds that he didn't need it because he already had his own meaning his painfully obvious

00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:17.799
erection in other words Aristophanes played to his audience by noting a

00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:25.799
similarity of alabastron and an erect penis in addition kius whose name means

00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:30.960
Banger he who bangs was offered the dildo shaped container

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:38.520
from his wife whose name means lubricated or juicy and her name happens to contain

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:43.799
the linguistic root for the type of drug contained in

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:51.200
the alabastron namely muron not only does mein's name refer to

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.720
a specific sex drug but she offers the very same substance to her husband and

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:04.279
provides the famous a dildo shaped container in which it was traditionally kept when Mary Magdalene brought the

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:09.559
alabastron to Jesus it was no surprise that it contained very expensive

00:25:09.559 --> 00:25:14.919
ointment the luxurious nature of the muron it contained was attested by the

00:25:14.919 --> 00:25:22.159
reaction of the apostles who vehemently complained that the ointment should have been sold in order to use funds to

00:25:22.159 --> 00:25:27.919
support the poor however New Testament translators and here's the catch are

00:25:27.919 --> 00:25:34.399
frequently tripped up when trying to translate the alabast passages quote

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:39.880
here they are doing their best while he was in Bethany at the home of Simon the

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.679
leper and reclining at the table there came a woman with an alabaster vial a

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:51.039
very costly perfume of pure nard and she broke the vial and poured it over his

00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:58.559
head now often times the alabastron is morphed by translators into a box rather

00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:05.320
than our dildo shaped vial and Mary is described as breaking the container in

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:11.840
order to open it which makes no sense Scholars fudge the translation of

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:17.919
the alabastron passages because the alternative to an accurate translation

00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:24.840
is terrible what is the alternative when describing Mary's action of the alabast

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:31.600
on the alabastron gospel writers use a form of the verb tribo which denotes

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:38.799
rubbing as a means of preparing or applying a drug to either an alabastrine

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:45.679
or human genitalia rubbing drugs like this onto a surface in Antiquity was a

00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:52.480
way of preparing uents for application the process would quote unquote warm the

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:58.679
drug and therefore ready it for use especially when applied to the the penis

00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:05.000
where its rigorous rubbing would facilitate its aphrodesia qualities as

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Jeffrey Henderson notes in his work on obscene language in

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:19.880
attic comedy the verb treban was used to rub or cha sexual organs in preparation

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:26.840
for intercourse Mary's rubbing of the oil on

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:33.080
the alabas and on Jesus fits the ancient pharmacological context on the use of

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:38.640
sex drugs it fits it very well and it's an actual step with the ancient methods

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.760
Mary is said to have rubbed the oil onto several body body parts of Jesus

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:50.200
including his head and his feet now biblical Scholars may be correct in

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:57.080
assuming a literal translation for head and feet but it should be noted that

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:03.200
those two specific body parts were also frequently used in Greek as euphemisms

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:11.480
to connote male genitalia specifically and when the word tribo catch this this

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:20.360
is philology 900 and when the verb tribo accompanies muron in the context

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:27.840
of feat it conveys the idea of vigorous oil

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:33.399
lubricated masturbation and the person bringing

00:28:33.399 --> 00:28:42.240
that to you is Jeffrey Henderson thank you Jeffrey Henderson appreciate that good work good work um yes

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:48.440
congratulations I like Jeffrey Henderson he's a nice guy um the ancient world may also have read explicitly sexual

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:54.360
references into the episode of Mary's use of the alabaster for

00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:01.960
nus wrote a summary of the the Gospel of John in which he used explicitly sexual

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:09.720
terminology to represent this scene now hold on hold on here this is going to get rough right this is where we begin

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:17.039
to see for the first time the reality right it's hold on

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:24.360
challenging he he said Mary used her

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:36.398
sultry hair to wipe the thick body fluids off of Jesus as he burned with

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:43.000
lust and in fact when Pope Gregory publicly affirmed

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.840
that Mary was employing sex drugs on Jesus he indirectly acknowledged that

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:55.960
the church recognize the sexual nature of what she

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:03.320
was doing okay so now we have a context we have a

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:09.760
c context to what's to uh to what's going on we have a profile of Mary and

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:16.760
we have a cult context of what's going on I want to um I want to with the rest

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:22.519
of our time I'm I'm going to limit myself because uh the information that I

00:30:22.519 --> 00:30:28.000
want to give you has to be processed and I think we're doing it best with a

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.320
shorter format like this right keeping it interesting there is one quote that I want to bring up on the screen here and

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:42.120
read to you um and I want you to gonna go ahead we're going to talk

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:49.120
about the Syrian nard you know we can talk about what it was that was in it and in the drug compound that Mary's

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:56.600
using and in doing so we have to turn to the pharmacological sources and the pharmacological sources are we have the

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:02.639
recipes for it right so um we can actually talk to you about the formula

00:31:02.639 --> 00:31:10.279
and how it was adulterated it was extremely expensive and it it was um it

00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:16.440
it was oftentimes adulterated or cut and sold in the marketplace for you know a

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:22.080
high cash value you know they're adding their baby powder to their cocaine right

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:30.000
um so uh yeah and so um her drug if you look at a lot of the different um Parts

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.120
a lot of the different plants that they're including within this compound

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:43.200
mixture um there are abortive Fati in it there are um drugs that are used against

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:50.760
venial disease in it which is nice um because it fits the context of of how

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:56.639
it's being used very beautifully um and there are references

00:31:56.639 --> 00:32:04.080
to um the reason it's called what it's called I mean this the muron you have to

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:12.159
realize is so common that you can just say I'm going to a place to buy drugs and call it the muron right it's a

00:32:12.159 --> 00:32:18.760
catchall for this larger group of drugs that's so commonly used and as dictis

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:26.000
tells us it's the um for example one of the opal balsamum is used as a for

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:33.200
chafing in on the labia labial chafing is uh uh treated with a drug and so

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:39.320
let's just take a look at this Source let's take a look at diores I just want you to see we only have time for this

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:44.278
tonight um yeah here it is I'm going to read

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:51.720
it it's the big quote chewy there we go thank you very much being one of the

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:58.159
strongest heating drugs opal balsamum has profound effects on the body body

00:32:58.159 --> 00:33:04.000
using it to clean the vagina of young girls dedicated to the gods it heats the

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.440
area surrounding the cervix when applied with rose oil

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:18.200
uent it expels the fetus and Associated fluids and when rubbed in it looses it

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:24.760
loosens inhibitions so you can see that the

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:31.960
pharmacological and medical uh knowledge is so important to reconstructing our

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:39.960
crime scene so when we're looking at that naked boy um and we're trying to find

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:47.159
him why he's there and answer the question of the mystery of why Jesus is arrested with a naked boy we have to go

00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:53.039
back to these clues that we've got to establish the context why did this

00:33:53.039 --> 00:34:00.799
happen what's the motive what is the tool that is used in the process process right um right it's it's gorgeousness

00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:09.040
and why are they all so drowsy during the whole Affair anyway um we will continue I I would like to introduce you

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:17.398
um to this great um baky and blasphemy and it's exactly what it is is blasphemy

00:34:17.399 --> 00:34:25.118
extreme blasphemy to know the history and to know what they were doing

00:34:25.119 --> 00:34:31.679
um is dangerous when the chemical Muse which I wrote was first reviewed by

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:38.398
brenmar classical review um it said this book is dangerous this book is dangerous it

00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:44.440
shouldn't be read on college campuses you know and there's a reason

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:49.520
there's a reason refute the evidence right say no the evidence isn't there

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:57.000
Daryl Bach didn't told me I was wasting my time not because I had sources and

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.359
actual history but for another reason that he wasn't

00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:08.960
expressing and it's the same reason my um the head of my

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:14.520
department during my dissertation defense expressed when she

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:20.520
said why do you want to say that the founders of Western Civilization were

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:25.800
using drugs why do you want to talk about their drug

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:33.359
use yeah yeah if it's reality we need to talk about it and as

00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:40.240
you can see from just dores one pharmacologist this is a reality and

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:51.000
there is a reason that Jesus was rested at 400 a. in a public park with a naked

00:35:51.319 --> 00:35:57.319
boy now we'll welcome Rob I summon Rob Rob would you mind coming into the

00:35:57.319 --> 00:36:05.119
conversation and just giving us a quick chat let's see Rob where's where's Rob bring Rob into

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:58.480
should be framed what is the gallery what is the congregation of Satan

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:06.160
saying right bear with me wasn't ready I had a list but when you said uh

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:13.640
Professor rook's coming on I I burned it said a few words and set thing up

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:19.040
like but I've got a digital version so first question do you want do you want

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:25.480
the first question yeah please please hit me with

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:33.400
what you've got okay uh could you ask a question uh I've been digging into macrobius and came across a

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:39.240
ritual for saturnalia where devotees would make wax figures of people say

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:45.240
incantations to Saturn over them and then ritually destroy them in an offer

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:50.920
to the goddess dies is this a reference to early a

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:57.000
human sacrifice other the gladitor gladiatorial games a ritual sacrifice to

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.440
Saturn and what is the connection between D and Saturn and why are they

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:10.160
combined into the god D pain h of a question is it yeah

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:16.760
fantastic yeah fantastic group of questions there's a lot in there so first of all let me just say macrobius

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:23.160
the fact that you're reading macrobius whoever is reading the saturnalia out there fantastic that's one of our major

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:30.640
sources for ancient Roman religion and um it's uh it's beautifully beautifully

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:37.079
detailed on the statues and Human Sacrifice oh I want to say um people are

00:38:37.079 --> 00:38:44.040
quick to jump into human sacrifice and we have to be in our area because we are

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:51.319
necromancers right and I have watched um so will I say that specific reference is

00:38:51.319 --> 00:38:57.599
a reference to human sacrifice I don't know because that's me making a jump I don't think that evidence allows us to

00:38:57.599 --> 00:39:03.000
come to that conclusion your honor right I think we have to be um is that a piece

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.040
that might build up to the bigger picture certainly certainly right and

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:13.400
that's what your thesis keep working on your thesis right so good good F uh

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:20.119
fantastic um what about the human sacrifice though I wanna I want to say and I want to add this we see this on

00:39:20.119 --> 00:39:25.160
the ne romantic side and it's not necessarily what you would think there's

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:32.280
this there's this electric science that exists in this Lial

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:37.319
World between life and death where you

00:39:37.319 --> 00:39:43.880
can take a freshly killed human being and you can reanimate

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:52.560
that human being for a short period of time and I have watched

00:39:52.560 --> 00:40:00.839
witches do this with chemicals and with song and with ritual and with

00:40:00.839 --> 00:40:06.119
something that that that um is gruesome

00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:12.119
where they pry they pry open the head they and this is why you see witches on Battlefield everybody knows this right

00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:19.079
um look at lcan if you want to see these witches they follow around the Roman army and then they mess with the bodies

00:40:19.079 --> 00:40:25.560
right they collect whatever goodies they need right because remember human parts

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:31.480
are full of of chemically active um chemically active substances

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:36.680
right good biochemistry there so are they performing necromancy on these

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:42.560
bodies I've seen a witches open a mouth and grab the tongue with their mouth and

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:49.000
then with some kind of intonation they make they're able to vibrate the

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.040
body um The Voice excuse me of the person there it's um they're able to put

00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:00.359
the air in the lungs and then move the air out while they're

00:41:00.359 --> 00:41:06.560
doing this to get the dead person to speak it's really I mean come on man you

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:13.960
got to be serious if you're going in that deep if you're if you're in the cemetery with st cian and you've got

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:21.160
Purple Venom um drizzling out of your anus um you know that you've you're deep

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:27.839
deep deep into the cult I mean these are these are the kind of Cults that Dr Bach doesn't want to talk about right but

00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:34.119
they're there and he can hide his head by the way of those 27 of those 27

00:41:34.119 --> 00:41:40.880
invites to research to contribution um uh I only got one

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:47.280
positive and interestingly enough it was from a woman um who is a

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:53.280
theologian and she encouraged me to continue the research in the direction

00:41:53.280 --> 00:42:00.839
that I was working and that it was you know it was um intriguing so um the rest were very

00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:07.880
negative and we're saying it's funny how many people will write you back and say as they have on this site and say you

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:12.920
are what you're talking about when we had Dr Ruck on a few minutes ago he was

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:18.079
shunned for talking about mushrooms

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:25.720
shunned um which now doesn't seem that odd but then it was a big deal so he was

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:31.839
shun talking about what are you going to do if you talk about drugs the first thing people are going to do and brenmar

00:42:31.839 --> 00:42:38.400
classical review did this they said this man obviously has a drug agenda and is

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:45.240
probably a drug user himself I was like are you kidding me are you kidding me um

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:51.559
so for those of you who are worried we are looking for that place as satanists

00:42:51.559 --> 00:43:00.119
we are looking for that place where Bach can no longer use his reason because if

00:43:00.119 --> 00:43:05.280
using his reason means pulling everything down around him he's

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:11.440
unwilling to do it right that's not faith faith allows you that space even

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:18.440
though it's an unreality um Rob any other questions yeah it's related to um the

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:25.359
last question is still Lord Snappy um can you do some perform something on

00:43:25.359 --> 00:43:33.599
screen for us some live Magic on on the stream at some point I know you promised small part

00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:40.599
yeah and uh we we we' like it pushed yeah we like to witness some and get get

00:43:40.599 --> 00:43:46.280
get some Fe down knowledge think what you make that by

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:53.160
the way brilliant mute yourself mute yourself

00:43:53.160 --> 00:44:01.319
yeah you would like that wouldn't you because Rob um you're an evil and wicked

00:44:01.319 --> 00:44:07.520
generation that desires a sign you want me to it's it's not enough it's not

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:16.839
enough to um show you the way it's not enough to perform in decent acts on

00:44:16.839 --> 00:44:22.839
ghosts it's not enough you want me to show you that's that's that's

00:44:22.839 --> 00:44:30.240
perfectly um the way of Satan nicely done nicely done if you can if this is

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:36.280
all about reason then I should be able to prove um the magic yes I should be

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:41.359
able to prove the magic I should be able to to perform the sores right in front of

00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:46.720
you right I should be able to summon a legion of

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:53.920
quanan who are in a position where they shouldn't be able to comprehend the

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.960
universe but they do and they see that there is a storm coming and that there

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:06.800
is a pedophilia behind wait a here's the trick here's the trick you wanted some

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:13.760
magic the trick is they're the ones promoting the

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:21.119
pedophilia they're the ones whose master was the arch pedophile and when I say

00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:29.240
pedophile I mean the name pedophile the time idle that was

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:36.240
given to the Savior yeah yeah won't that be funny

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:42.680
qanon will have to figure out they themselves and that's when you realize you're in prison Rob when you ask for

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:48.280
the magic you reveal that you are in a prison yeah

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:53.800
gorgeous other questions yeah that that was Lord Snappy

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:59.680
asking uh we've got old boy and we're going to go to the the

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:06.640
language most it's from previous episodes you mentioned the vowels aren't overly important does this infer the

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:13.240
early forms of written Greek was or came from the abjad alphabet this would make

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:18.640
sense as neighboring civilizations such as the atrans seem to use more runic

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:26.200
style alphabet another fascinating presentation right yeah nice nice

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:32.240
question nice question um they're all great questions but um

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:39.359
yeah what about the vowels so all I can say with any sort of expertise is being a guy who reads this stuff every day for

00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:46.240
for the last 30 years all I can tell you from my expertise is not what that original alphabet was it's nice though

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:54.200
that you're looking at the atrin right and asking those questions I can tell you that within the root system that is

00:46:54.200 --> 00:47:00.240
used in ancient Greek within its root system vowels are

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:07.280
attunements they are an attempt to take that root concept and finally finally

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:12.359
tune it so that it's it's uh can be shown as distinguished there two

00:47:12.359 --> 00:47:19.040
different concepts that are springing from the same root yeah so that's what the vowels are

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:26.319
there for they're there for atonement and and um that's about the best just from somebody who reads the stuff

00:47:26.319 --> 00:47:33.880
once you understand um with the um with the Str Str route for example once you

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:39.559
understand where that ionian form goes you know in the different dialects in Greek they use different vowels and

00:47:39.559 --> 00:47:45.119
different lengthenings I mean you can say it means kill or EA it means spare

00:47:45.119 --> 00:47:51.960
or have mercy on so um The Vows are doing something

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:57.240
Musical that is kind of fine-tuning and I've often I've often wondered if within

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:03.720
the magic when they're performing the incantations and one of the best texts you can read is there's an addition of

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:10.400
all uh at least the ones that they found fragments incantations both in Greek and in Latin

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:15.640
and um in that there is something that the vowels are doing to attune and even

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:21.800
in the PGM you will have where the incantation will stop from any Greek that we can

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:27.720
translate and recognize and it will bust into not just the uh wokas magiki the

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:35.319
magical voices but it will burst into this vowel thing where it goes

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:41.040
I I you

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:46.400
I and then Y is the it's like a cap on the

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:51.599
DNA it's like a message a codon that tells you stop translating here right

00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:58.240
this is where you cut the DNA um it's very molecular that way the vow are doing that and um they're they're

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:05.040
composing commands um entry commands and exit commands in within the incantation

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:12.480
uh freaky stuff but remember you know they're all on drugs so yeah it's hard to I guess you got to go there in in

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:18.040
order to understand um any other questions Rob I

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:24.280
mean let's take one more question I don't want I don't want to keep people forever because I'm targeting I'm

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:32.000
targeting you know your attention because okay you know okay well I'm gonna move on because

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:39.720
n Nancy had asked about the inferences through uh through the language and whether we can whether we

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:46.839
take it the wrong way sometimes and make the wrong inference and she she wondered about the gadfly and why isn't why isn't

00:49:46.839 --> 00:49:54.680
it a hornet why I don't refer to it as a hornet um it was like to do with the the

00:49:54.680 --> 00:50:00.440
references but I'm going to move on because I I want to try to get U I got

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:06.200
konus and he wants to know if D you think D Isis is going to come back I

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:12.480
like that question I do because thought it himself that yeah in a sense and he

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:17.760
he actually thinks is dying Isis might have already came come back in the form

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:24.640
of Christ is it isn't isn't that nice is

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.880
could you ask could you in order to answer that could you ask um what if

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:36.160
he's here already and what if that you know like

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:42.680
the guys at MIT are saying now it's two universes you we have two universes it's two Dimensions they're placed over each

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:48.160
other one is invisible to the other but they take up the same space and you can

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:53.480
measure the background radiation right from these giant Scopes and Antarctica

00:50:53.480 --> 00:51:00.799
right of where these two dimensions are interacting so um is dionis already here

00:51:00.799 --> 00:51:08.799
now if you mean is he coming back in a resurrection form if he's coming back in a resurrection form um you might be

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:14.240
you're now you're leaning over on the Gnostic side I'm not sure from where the from where the question which angle the

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:21.520
question is going do I want to see dianis back and his resurrected body um

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:30.160
when he comes he'll be wearing a bra right he'll be wearing that Holy golden

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:36.680
beautifully embroidered embroidered Galan capturing nipple

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:44.160
surrounding uh uh um garment yeah and he's got it on in John

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:51.200
it's there dianis is there in John right there's a reason people listen there's a

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:56.880
reason that uh uh uh Pluto AR

00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:04.240
says that the Jews are performing bonic rights there's a reason for that um if

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:09.440
if this mystery has has made its way

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:15.319
from the Bronze Age all the way down through this thing called

00:52:15.319 --> 00:52:22.960
Judaism right through the bakic worship by by the Greeks who spread all

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:29.040
the way over to the pillars of Heracles if if if we are able to follow this

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:34.440
right all all the way down we can we can come up with the details of why Jesus is

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:41.599
Calling himself a savior and why he's talking about his blood and what is that

00:52:41.599 --> 00:52:46.960
stuff on his face that they say in the garden that is it's like

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:54.000
great clotted blood what is that stuff doing there um um you know we don't we

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:00.200
don't just want you to tell us he's got a condition he's got hosis we want to know why one of the things that I tried

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:05.880
to bring you tonight but didn't quite have enough time is um uh the use of the

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:11.799
antidotes the use of the antidotes we're really G to have to get into this is Satanist because this whole Christ

00:53:11.799 --> 00:53:18.359
Antichrist thing is obession of physics it's a reality that you have to be able

00:53:18.359 --> 00:53:24.520
to grasp in order to manipulate and how are they doing this very practically they're doing this with

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:30.680
drugs dotes and antidotes and um for those of you by the

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:36.200
way I I just wanted to say for those of you who are looking at

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:41.920
um interested in things esoteric Gnostic and you're you're doing your shopping on

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:47.160
YouTube Anytime you find somebody who says um they're doing Greek they won't

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:53.240
tell you they they um they're Greek scholar they may say there's a Greek scholar anytime they throw in something

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:59.119
about Greek um make sure that they've taken those steps

00:53:59.119 --> 00:54:06.079
that guys like um Dr Carl Ruck have taken notice I didn't say Bach right

00:54:06.079 --> 00:54:13.480
they've taken those reasoned step that reason step they're able to

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:19.520
say okay I'm going to look at this reference that talks about um how you

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:27.720
can make a young girl Priestess more pliable and more ready to receive

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:35.119
intercourse while protecting her from venial disease and preventing any sort

00:54:35.119 --> 00:54:41.559
of pregnancy because we're going to drink that stuff that she produces right people don't want to go there Bach

00:54:41.559 --> 00:54:49.319
doesn't want to go there right but this is the world we have to get to in order to get to Jesus's boy

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:55.200
so um uh Rob I'm sorry tonight that um

00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:01.760
Dr Carl Ruck was not in the flesh he's only on video um I'm sorry for that but

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:09.359
I'm gonna be doing this more frequently I'm going to be bringing um testimonies in and you don't

00:55:09.359 --> 00:55:17.920
have to if you if you want to have a testimony you don't have to shave your head like Rob and I do right but if

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:23.640
you're going I if you're going to enter into morning which is why Mary Magdalene

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:28.920
has the alabaster in the first place if you're going to enter into that morning for

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:36.280
Adonis then um you need to shave or present yourself publicly for

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:42.079
intercourse e either of those will do I've had people ask me what about I don't want to shave my head well there's

00:55:42.079 --> 00:55:47.920
an option right in mour for Adonis you can go and you can enter into that

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:54.799
sphere right you can go to the Temple of Aphrodite right you and offer yourself

00:55:54.799 --> 00:56:01.440
and and don't worry they will give you the drugs that will make sure oh it's the temple prostitution right it's that

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:06.559
alabastron that Mary is caring and nobody sees the reality because you've

00:56:06.559 --> 00:56:14.319
been trained on fairy tales I'm G to end with that anger I'm G

00:56:14.319 --> 00:56:19.359
to end with that anger because I don't want I don't want to keep you guys you've given me already too too much
