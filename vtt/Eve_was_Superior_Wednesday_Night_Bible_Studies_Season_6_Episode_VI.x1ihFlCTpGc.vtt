make it you see in the back translation of the Hebrew it didn't make it when it

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:11.079
was being forced back um by um Scholars to try to create a Hebrew temp plate you

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:17.918
know those guys are all out there in the caves with their Scrolls you know what they're doing They're copying Greek

00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:23.678
texts into Hebrew and when they do so they mess things up because the Hebrew

00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:28.720
cannot capture with its limited vocabulary the extensive vocabulary of

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:34.039

say mystery you're saying bakus PE people

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:53.639
and you what how how is that how is that shut

00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:04.120
up there is one mystery one Bronze Age mystery and from that

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:10.840
mystery comes all of the others from that comes the death and Resurrection

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:20.360
mystery from that comes the one who is the child of God through the

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:30.039
Virgin this thing that we are looking at this book of Genesis with this Garden

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.960
this was a place where a

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:42.799
God where AOS established his own

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:48.400
worship it was an oracular religion where the

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:55.360
AA who was Zoey would bring the man to the place of

00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.840
initiation where their eyes would be open opened there's only one

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.960
problem there's only one problem he pulled

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:13.400
out devil got in the way yeah had to De with the dying thing

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:20.600
and the technical truth of the matter poor devil poor devil when your cios is a

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:27.520
lying sack it's all you can get it's all you can get a third of the Angels people a

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.640
third of the the Angels think about that for a minute one out of

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:41.440
three said God can take it and stick it one

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.760
out of Three Angels wow think about that for a minute

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:54.960
think about it you think you're smarter than they are don't you the Watchers know that they know that they watch you

00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:00.880
it's the fuzz in the air that they get you think you know better you don't you

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:08.200
don't you don't know this quantum physics right people we got to we got to take the humble route we got to take the

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:14.360
humble route let's go back to the source I'm going to show you something I'm going to show you the the poisoning I'm

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:20.080
gonna show you the attempt to turn Adam

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:26.559
into a slave of the cios are you ready you ready this is a

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:32.360
real this is a real mystery thing did you see Moses sitting there right next to the

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:38.919
muses did you see him let's go here we go yeah yeah yeah

00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:44.320
yeah yeah yeah um okay people this is for the this is

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:51.279
for the people among you and I know you're out here a lot of you are like this you're the Smart Ones I want you to

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:57.120
figure out this has a a little game going on in it in the Greek here you

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:03.919
know it's explaining to you the way that we drive the name for woman the Greek

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:11.440
name for woman which is goon goon and it says that name goon is

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:20.320
derived from the fact that she was taken that she was taken from him taken

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:26.880
from him okay just conceptually hang in there with me she was taken from him so

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:32.320
wait a minute this this word goon this word

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:41.440
goon the word for woman it's got to be does it say taken from a man no it

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.679
doesn't so the phrase is nonsensical what about if it's in Hebrew what about

00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:53.559
if it's in Hebrew what about if it's in Hebrew I can hear you I feel your energy

00:24:53.559 --> 00:25:00.279
I know you're out there I feel you um it doesn't work in Hebrew either

00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:06.360
Hebrew is just ishan Isa right all you do is put a feminine on the on the root

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:12.480
there's no taking out of there's no word coming from it but now remember this

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:21.880
text this Bible is written in the 3 Century third and 2 and maybe even first

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:30.039
in the 3 Century so um what do we expect to happen we expect for it to reflect

00:25:30.039 --> 00:25:35.080
learning from the third century and customs and culture and guess what it

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:43.840
does it does precisely bring it up again chewy bring it up again um she was taken

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:49.799
from the [Music] man where do how are we going to make

00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:55.760
this thing make sense how are we gonna because it it's the linguistically it does they call her goon because she was

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:01.200
taken from the an h no ish from ish ah

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.559
nope but if you go back to trus and what

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:11.600
it truskin palasan the old stuff watch this you

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.840
know where apestas comes from that old stuff Lucifer the old

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:23.760
stuff the old stuff are you are you kidding me this is worship of oh my God

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:29.520
bring up the next one bring it up look what happens people look what happens this is the word

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.720
weo weo in Latin and it literally means

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:42.760
LED from the man LED from the wear it means that if it were this word it would

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:51.320
make complete sense well what is this word this is the word for a heroic Maiden a what a Female warrior a Female

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:56.720
warrior you see female warriors right we got them we got them too I've seen them

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:02.760
they say they make better snipers than anyone yeah we I go we I go they ought

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:10.080
to let them control everything too you know what I mean because I'll bet you I'll bet you a few of these as generals

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:17.840
would be outstanding love it love it we AO we AO

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:23.679
okay let's keep keep how is that Ausin getting in there you tell me you tell me

00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:30.760
we're reading a book that you didn't realize see how you trampled over this just like I did you just walked over it

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:36.039
with King James you just walked over it with that Hebrew Matic text because the

00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:43.240
Hebrew Matic text didn't know how to render that pleasureful sex Garden it

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:50.480
didn't know should we no and that's how stuff gets buried

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:56.799
in history that's how stuff gets buried within text this is the advantage of

00:27:56.799 --> 00:28:02.799
being um In classical philology this is not a recruitment but um this is the

00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:07.840
advantage of classical philology it gives you access gives you access to the

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:13.279
sources and you figure out you read them you read a hundred other sources around

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:19.320
them and then you figure out what the vocabulary is doing it's logic and science bro it's not

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:27.080
voodoo right logic and science this is the trying to bring back this presocratic bro let let's keep going

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:32.720
let's keep going um yeah what happens here yeah so look Nobody's around for

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:39.240
Adam that is a Boos he's got nothing what is a Bo AOS this is what he needs

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:46.679
that God makes for him that God makes for him and I promised you I was going

00:28:46.679 --> 00:28:54.640
to show you the drugging right okay so we're at the party we're at the bonic party in the paradise sex Garden right

00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:01.200
and Adam is lonely he's sitting there all by himself and there's animals you

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:09.640
hear the music there's animals there why yeah yeah no this one no doesn't do

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:15.919
it doesn't do it for me what does he need Boos what is that it's something

00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:23.080
very specific in Greek which again the Hebrew is unable to capture it is that

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:31.480
individual it is that individual who comes to your

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:37.279
side with that Shield do you know what Athena carries

00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:45.039
around who is the Weir AO of all Weir AOS Athena manura if you look at that

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:51.000
definition for Weir AO up there you're gonna see mana's name next to it she's

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.279
the one with that Shield you see that you see that manura there uh-huh there's

00:29:57.279 --> 00:30:03.120
's a reason look at the Amazon at the bottom this is what you talk about with Amazonian

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:12.120
women they can be one of these boyos they can be that one who comes up

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:19.760
on your side in battle and the two of you will conquer why because her Shield

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:25.159
take it down her Shield is protecting

00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:31.519
you you run with nerva isn't that

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:39.640
nice fantastic um that's Eve she wouldn't have a title on her name e

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:46.799
unless she was that bakic minad and these bakic Meads I must remind you and

00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:53.480
many of you were buying courses and you're looking at you're you're looking at things online about mystery religions

00:30:53.480 --> 00:31:00.720
mystery and somebody's going to make some profit profit off of you you're walking up to people on the street you

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:07.679
know what you are let's do mirror time this is mirror time Chey mirrror time let's mark this um you're walking you

00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:14.240
know what you're doing you're walking in the street now there's a dude or a dudette sitting there and they've got a

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:22.200
deck of cards they're going to tell you your future for $25 isn't that nice isn't that

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:28.840
nice yeah do you know what should happen do you know what should happen we should

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:35.600
all find out what happens to those people on the other side when they get

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:44.519
to those places that possess those powers that were so pure that they exposed for the

00:31:44.519 --> 00:31:50.679
sake of prostitution because that's what they're doing they're prostituting

00:31:50.679 --> 00:31:53.679
themselves

00:31:55.799 --> 00:32:01.159
prostitution okay yeah it disappoints me but that's not

00:32:01.159 --> 00:32:08.159
what we're here for right you and I we don't want that we don't want the street show and that we want the reality we

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:14.080
want that ether that quantum physics that lies behind what they're doing

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:23.519
let's see the next tech let's keep opening it up yeah yeah so what happens here he needs this weo he needs this

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:31.760
manura and um so what does God do to him look at here it is look at line

00:32:34.399 --> 00:32:43.080
21 easy ecstasy God what is God's solution to

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:49.600
finding the one for Adam right which is funny because can

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:58.799
anybody smell can anybody smell the Argonauts can anybody smell the captive

00:32:58.799 --> 00:33:05.600
women can anybody smell the Sorceress Why Can't This dude Adam do

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.760
his stuff on his own there's nowhere you'll notice in the text so far that it

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:17.760
has said that it has said Adam is the first man there's nowhere in the

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:24.240
text yeah yeah that there were no other human beings around here no no no do you

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:29.919
see what's happening this is not about your God speaking things into existence

00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:35.919
this is the book of the generation of Gia and

00:33:36.279 --> 00:33:41.880
uranos yeah and your God has his

00:33:43.399 --> 00:33:49.279
place look at us people we're taking we're ripping that Bible right out of

00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:55.799
their hands I have that Bible holding it right in my hands there's not a Christian that can touch it there's not

00:33:55.799 --> 00:34:03.760
a Christian that can touch that thing I don't mean any of them not a

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:10.240
single one of them we have the text now that gives us the freedom that's the

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:16.118
bakic power now you know why bakic worship always centers around the muse

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:22.040
now you know oh God love it okay well um another

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.520
text another text um look at here uh look at here where

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:34.679
did I get dis yeah displacement standing inside where was the I can't see the top

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:41.638
entry ex the ecstasis good so um what is this

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:47.440
when you they're telling you from right from the top remember I said people that verbs go to the verbs and always see

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.520
what the verbs are that comes from and it's exist here so it's kind of to stand

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:58.680
out of and people will say this preachers will say this all the time

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:04.560
they'll be like oh and you know this is a take take the word apart literally and see well it's a little more

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:11.320
sophisticated than that a little more sophisticated the jumping meaning is not as simple as you'd think yeah this means

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:17.760
to stand outside to stand outside now do we blow it up and let me see the um let

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:24.000
me see the drift on this one look standing aside number two number two stand distraction of the Mind from

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:32.960
Terror and astonishment right so this is not necessarily your your daddy your mommy's

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.480
ecstasy right this is not their ecstasy this is the stuff that you can get from

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:44.320
Terror you mean you can be in Terror and ecstatic at the same time you mean you

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:50.480
can be astonished confused confounded uh we're about to see Paul in this drugged

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:55.880
out confounded state of ecstasy yeah they're not talking about ecstasy like

00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:01.960

wait your honor can you force this witness to cough that up again because you repeat

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:53.079
your question um Paul with a how old um

00:38:53.079 --> 00:38:58.400
13 not yet 14

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:04.119
H okay sure are you sure let's look at it let's look at drugged out Paul doing

00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:10.960
his thing are you ready because we are in Paradise you're not going to believe me but we are

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:18.960
in Paradise I thought you said Paradise was a place for sex and drugs and eye eye

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:26.079
opening things yes I did and so does Paul chewy bring us to the night star

00:39:26.079 --> 00:39:32.520
system um NOP we come back to that later keep going down

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:40.200
yep no uh yeah okay yeah yeah so Paul says this is 2 Corinthians 12 Paul says

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:45.920
I'm just going to translate this for you I'll just stand up like this o anop I

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:53.400
knew a dude in Christ wait what you knew a dude in Christ take that down you knew

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:59.960
a dude in Christ what does that mean look at the translations of this it's hilarious that the ones that try to stay

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:06.599
so literal you know you can't capture the meaning I knew a person in Christ I

00:40:06.599 --> 00:40:13.720
knew them in [Music] Christ okay go on to the next go on what

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:19.960
does it mean um let's figure out what that means proon

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.839
proon um premature of 14 years just

00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:32.800
before 14 years now your translations will have caved on this one right and

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:40.119
they will say 14 years ago but this is a very strange way of putting that um and

00:40:40.119 --> 00:40:47.560
I'm going to say since we've already mention the anthropo that this is putting the kid's age within framework

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:55.160
and it's perfectly within its rights to do that I mean this is not odd right to express age so he's he's a little bit

00:40:55.160 --> 00:41:02.280
before um 14 years old so you knew this guy in Christ right yeah and then he

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:10.440
says something really weird because Paul is high he's high right now did you know he's high he's high he's describing

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:17.400
Visions he has Visions these are visions that are caused by the messenger of

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:24.440
Satan are you ready I don't know he says whether it was in body I don't know

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:32.920
whether it was out of body only God knows only God knows

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:42.000
but this guy was pulled all the way up into the third uranos next one wait what

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.599
the kid that you're with was pulled into the uranos how do you know how do you

00:41:48.599 --> 00:41:55.319
know when the kid that you're with okay how do you know that he's entered

00:41:55.319 --> 00:42:01.720
into that into that area facial

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:09.560
expression right you are bringing out pan within the person you are causing

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:18.359
that possession through your druged sex act yeah it is a brilliant form of

00:42:18.359 --> 00:42:24.640
control of ancient cultural control and this stuff comes from the Bronze Age people it's when they're developing it

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:30.400
now it may have it may have happened happened prior but we don't have any

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:35.960
records of it we do from the Bronze Age Sorcerers we know what they were doing

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:41.800
and what kind of boy slaves they were making and what kind of prostitution

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:48.760
they were pushing we know what kind of drugs they were using and we know what people were saying at least about what

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:54.319
they were doing because we have that literature we

00:42:54.319 --> 00:43:02.400
have that evidence and remember this is hundreds of years before the Bible ever

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:08.079
existed okay so this is the real that we're looking at let's go to the text

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:13.599
one more time and again I appreciate your time um he was taken up next one to

00:43:13.599 --> 00:43:18.760
the third heaven okay um what is that um

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:26.280
yeah let's keep going I'm going to check that with the next text um and I yeah and I I knew a man I know this guy Ry

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.319
well I don't know whether in mind or body I don't know he says it twice he's

00:43:31.319 --> 00:43:37.559
wait Paul your Visions they're either they can be out of body of course of

00:43:37.559 --> 00:43:44.359
course he's taken up in the spirit he's taken up in the spirit when Jesus sees

00:43:44.359 --> 00:43:50.119
uranos crack open right and you're standing there on the shore you're

00:43:50.119 --> 00:43:56.280
standing there on the shore with the baptism and he comes out of the water and the stuff John has given him is has

00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:04.160
allowed him to see uranos open uranos open it's in that cup did you drink out

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:10.680
of the phace shaped cup that the saturnist juvenile tells us

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:15.760
about did you drink out of that Jesus is that why you're seeing uros the way you

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:23.079
are is that is that why you can do this you know are you just the one who's

00:44:23.079 --> 00:44:28.160
requiring the AWA is that what you need

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:34.520
Jesus Jesus Christ Jesus Christ what is going on text let's go

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:40.520

to those of you out there who have suffered this

00:46:13.359 --> 00:46:22.079
silence who have been forced to remain silent not to speak about things because

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:29.640

leace is not just the

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:15.920
robber I'm hoping that you're beginning to see that the cult of the mystery as

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:24.079
it develops in the Bronze Age that that cult is a cult that

00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:30.640
involves sex drugs children and Jesus

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:37.640
Christ who was arrested in a public park with a naked boy at 4:00

yours no it doesn't belong to to you this book is a Greek work from the 3

00:48:02.119 --> 00:48:10.559
century and it has within it some of the greatest gems of this mystery initiation in this

00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:16.800
mystery right God the cuos from the very

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:24.280
beginning was establishing the mystery of the oracular

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:32.280
