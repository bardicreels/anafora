00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:51.199
sketch of Jesus he's the dude who talks to everybody in

00:05:51.199 --> 00:06:00.759
Parables right he's the one who gives them only as much as they can hear

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:07.800
without Parables he doesn't speak except when he's on his own with his kids and

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.560
then he explains to them okay I get it Jesus I get it somebody was saying the

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:21.120
other day what about the what about the apostles one of them's got to be over 18

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.639
are any of them over 18 one of them was a tax collector here's the funny thing

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:34.240
about the tax collector side Matthew was sitting there at the tax collector Booth

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.680
doesn't mean he was a tax collector so even Matthew can be put

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.880
into that same category of boys that Jesus goes randomly around picking up

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:53.560
because that's how the ministry of the man we're following tonight begins hail

00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:01.520
Satan yeah we've got to stick with the truth right we got to remind ourselves every once in a while to stick with the

it's a portal through the flesh isn't that nice through the flesh you make

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:06.039

copton what does he cut himself with just rocks just rocks whatever he can

00:20:32.039 --> 00:20:38.200
find yeah whatever he can find do you get a feeling now that you're meeting

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:43.280
this guy that is talking to Jesus and we're going to see from his reaction to

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:50.400
Jesus exactly who Jesus is yeah so remember we got there when we have our

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:57.120
ship with our children now we're talking to the naked man who just came out of

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.159
the mountains were Cemetery H screaming

00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:08.120
right fantastic that's that's our world let's go to the next one please good

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:13.720
Mark uh and seeing Jesus what does he say he's sing from afar he Ed he

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:21.159
actually runs up and he prises them he bends down he bends down

00:21:21.159 --> 00:21:29.159
to Jesus he gets down on the knees he lowers himself to Jesus this is what

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:36.440
naked man does why would naked man do this because we know what those cuts are

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:43.120
for and we know that Jesus is who he is you're the Christos he knows it haven't

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.200
you ever wondered all these people walk up to

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:53.440
Jesus and they're saying you're the Christos yeah haven't you ever wondered

00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:03.559
why they were able to do that yeah yeah he is is performing those cathartic

00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:11.320
measures to purify to purify yes he is purifying let's look at

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:17.159
some more let's look at some more of his images with his children who are

00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:25.880
depicted as grown people not that this shouldn't bother us because there's nothing wrong with a group of grown men

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:31.840
washing each other's feet there's nothing wrong with that the fact

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:37.880
is though those grown men are only grown men because that's the way that we want

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:44.000
to construct the false narrative right we have to it would look weird if Jesus

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.799
was in a room with a bunch of kids and he got naked and tied his underwear on

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:55.760
and then went around washing feet and using his underwear towel to wipe off

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:02.919
the TW the feet of an 12-year-old boy named John who he

00:23:02.919 --> 00:23:08.679
loveded yes John was his favorite everybody knew that everybody knew that

00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:14.200
about Jesus why do you think he was yelling I'm not a lace days right okay

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.279
let's keep going this it gets it gets gruesome people it's the Bible it's the

00:23:19.279 --> 00:23:25.159
Bible but it belongs to us so let's just see what does he say um he he says in a

00:23:25.159 --> 00:23:30.480
in a voice he screams right he says hey um

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:36.440

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.600
you see that that was the quickest magic trick ever look at this um melchisedec

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:56.240
oh my God I'm reading from The Book of Genesis why am I reading from The Book

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:03.960
of Genesis because this is all contemporary stuff right Genesis isn't written till the 3 Century BC its

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:12.080
vocabulary and content are all mixed up in the milu that is our new testament

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:19.720
yes and here here look mezc you remember mezc what he's that that king of Sal and

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:26.640
what does he do he brings Bread and Wine he brings bread and wi what where am I

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:33.840
what period no you're not where you think you are you're not back in 1100 you're not back in 1300 with a dude

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:39.200
named Moses you were not going back to Abraham what are we doing we're going to

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:45.159
the god the God is on the second line who

00:25:45.159 --> 00:25:55.559
Fe that is who the naked dude from the tomb identifies Jesus as

00:25:55.559 --> 00:26:02.320
the son of right and now you say oh oh that's all

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:10.639
why they're always talking about you take it down why they're always talking about those gods of the high

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:17.000
places exactly Jesus is being

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.399
identified by a man who makes intentional Cuts all over his skin and

00:26:22.399 --> 00:26:29.360
possesses what seems to be Incredible strength coupled with a lot of nudity

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:35.520
and a lot of people afraid of him and he's got a he's now bowing that dude is

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.799
now bowing telling Jesus he's the son of the

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:46.279
highest the son of the highest just saw him get off the boat comes over right

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:54.640
what does the son of the highest do what do you think he does what do you think he does you do what Heracles does with

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.720
hus yeah do you know Heracles got mistaken for a lace

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:04.960
days it's what happens when you sail in the port and you have your children with

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:10.720
you you mean Jesus was on a

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:17.480
boat as a pirate oh hang on hang on I just got

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:26.520
something oh my god oh sit still sit still son of the

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:32.089
highest [Music]

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:38.000
but seriously when Heracles got mistaken for one he corrected it right he

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.960
corrected it because you know it's your reputation is everything right and you

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:50.760
don't want to be pinched as one of these people who is involved in the trafficking of children for the sake of

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:57.519
sexual gratification now you know why Jesus is screaming I am not a child tra

00:27:57.519 --> 00:28:04.519
trafficker he does not he just like Heracles he gets into a situation where he doesn't really want to be there it's

00:28:04.519 --> 00:28:11.440
too dangerous it's too dangerous okay let's go to the next text I love this stuff no the next one yeah I think that

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:18.240
was uhhuh no no that's the highest let's go next one please gorgeous yeah and so

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:26.919
what did he what did he say to him he said ex this is Jesus now son of the highest

00:28:26.919 --> 00:28:33.000
right and but these sons of God by the way um they're associated with the

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:41.440
mystery performances so you always have a son of God who is that Central um

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:48.000
producer of the um right and Heracles for example there's temples to Heracles

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.399
all over right and they're performing these Mysteries and the only woman who's

00:28:53.399 --> 00:28:59.399
allowed to be in them when Heracles is with his children is media right because

00:28:59.399 --> 00:29:07.600
she is the one who's able to derive ultimately the ARA Wei so okay cool cool

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:13.720
I see why she's there this is fantastic but this is the right that we are

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:20.559
looking at if we're talking about the Hoops St the Son of God is an absolute

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:28.559
fragment of History right dionis is the Son of God in the enthusiastic right

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:34.960
Heracles was the son of God in the enthusiastic

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:40.039
right you notice that he was going to hell right

00:29:40.039 --> 00:29:47.200
Heracles right orus dianis they're all doing it when the

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:56.039
dude who is naked and under the influence of that sex craved maniacal

00:29:56.039 --> 00:30:02.399
Spirit that's that's where he is yeah when the dude is there that's all that

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:08.039
he's got and so he ends up begging Jesus to stay there right and Jesus is like no

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:15.120
bro I gotta go I got to do my thing elsewhere with these children right and

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:22.720
you know that's that's the way it goes right off he goes he gives a little wave flashbang and there you go right now

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:30.039
somehow we turn that into a narrative that makes sense in in order to feed our

00:30:30.039 --> 00:30:37.720
delusional understanding that Jesus popped on the scene Boop and he said I'm the Son of God and Christ and

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:45.360
everybody's like oh no no that's not how it happened you know it and I know it

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:52.320
yes yes let every Evangelical know it our strength our

00:30:52.320 --> 00:31:00.120
strength is bringing the Bible to them that's our strength showing them rubbing

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:07.200
their face in it taking that naked Kid scene with Jesus that's so perverted and

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:15.600
showing them look look what your guys doing look what your guys doing I had an interview today on a podcast um I'll let

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:21.399
you know further information about that but um that's what you can do with

00:31:21.399 --> 00:31:27.559
people show them the text open up their eyes just open up their eyes to what's

00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:35.639
there okay let's go you guys know that we're doing that Hallelujah right Hallelujah chewy Hallelujah let's go on

00:31:35.639 --> 00:31:42.440
to Mark 59 and he asked him he said uh what's your name and he said to him my

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:48.240
name is Legion oh I forgot I just can't okay it's not right he's got a plurality

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:54.679
he's got a plurality that Jesus has to command right what what does Jesus do to

00:31:54.679 --> 00:32:01.799
the dude he casts out those Spirits he casts out those Spirits

00:32:01.799 --> 00:32:08.440
you mean he brings him to a place of of total sanity yes he takes a visibly

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:14.840
Disturbed mentally Disturbed individual and he knows exactly how to

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:20.399
bring him back oh are we talking about the treatment now I'm going to take it

00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:27.519
somewhere this is kind of a side a side um field trip I want you to go I'm going

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:34.120
to take you to some texts that have some of the darkest magic about them the darkest

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:41.960
psychological medicine all right how do you heal you know what happens it turns out you're a

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:47.519
depressed person don't try to make them feel better don't feed those serotonin

00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:55.159
Loops that's not what they need they don't need the chemicals that make you feel better they don't need that they

00:32:55.159 --> 00:33:02.519
need the ones that show you Terror the ones that induce psychosis that bring

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:08.639
you to a place where you question everything and everyone and where you

00:33:08.639 --> 00:33:14.480
can see your sanity laid out right in front of you this is an ancient form of

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:22.159
healing you mean I got to turn I got to turn my friend into a freak of nature in order to get him back

00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:29.080
into a place of Health yes it's what you have to do Jes Jesus knows what is being

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:35.519
used at the time he knows about the Water of Life and he knows about the

00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:42.399
treatment let's go to the next let's go to the next Source there he is that's gorgeous look at him I'm not quite sure

00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:50.600
I don't even know from this can we just stop J for a second look at this look at this I I don't even know

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:56.080
what fragment of first of all it's not a towel he's wearing around his waist it's

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:02.600
not looks like you get that from the next door the hotel next door is bed sheet or something who brought all the

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:08.358
sheets to these people who covered them up the NIV covered them up what is that

00:34:08.359 --> 00:34:16.320
the NIV The New International Version it covered them up it turned the scene down into a garment like that for the sake of

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:22.800
the fairy tale but look none of this makes sense what are they doing do people look at this if you looked into a

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:28.280
room let's be scientist if you looked into a room and you saw this sitting in

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:36.480
front of you this is what the people are doing what's the first thing you would think something wrong with these people

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:43.520
does this look like a normal scene first of all why is he touching his feet why is he wearing a sheet did he just get

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:48.599
lost from a toga party what's going on and what are those perverts doing

00:34:48.599 --> 00:34:55.720
looking in the window get out of there you weirdos what is this even a scene of

00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:01.640
am I supposed to be drawn to this I mean Christians criticize the classical art

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:07.599
for being so full of that luscious loveliness of life that the artist catch

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:13.119
what is this luscious loveliness this is weird I just came across a building with

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:21.520
some dudes I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure they were involved in some culty stuff it's weird now imagine if they

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:28.400
just put the apostles in the right age group yeah imagine if Jesus is doing

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:35.480
that with a 10-year-old John 10-year-old John poor John poor

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.960
John oh God it's sad save the children people what happened how come nobody

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:46.680
wants to save these children save the apostles that's what I say get them in

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:52.760
into out of the hands of this lace taste and send them back to school maybe that's why people wanted Jesus crucified

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:59.440
maybe they wanted this kind of activity cleaned up I don't know I don't know no there's resistance to it right we're

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:08.800
trying to civilize this province this Backwater dis place here have libraries how are

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:14.119
you supposed to know anything here pave the roads people the dirt's not for

00:36:14.119 --> 00:36:22.799
walking on build yourself an infrastructure get this thing done come on civilization

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:31.200
calls it's a struggle it's a struggle in an Antiquity between classical

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:37.200
civilization and the Rough and Tumble Backwoods of the frontier that's what it

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.560
is and Judea is part of that Frontier um yeah yeah let's go to the next Source

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.760
this is lovely um I I'm gonna wrap up here in just yeah I'm GNA wrap up pretty

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:54.880
quick but I wanted you to know um yeah so the people of the town I just wanted you to see here they come and they see

00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:03.640
that his demoniac look at the f look at the second first word on the second line Deon Menon right the one who's been

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:09.800
filled with that Dion and you say to yourself I'm thanking demon from my

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:15.240
silly narrative that's been fed into my head from the Christian perversion of

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:22.119
the text and yes that's exactly that demon is power and we recognize that

00:37:22.119 --> 00:37:27.839
those powers are controlled by drugs yes there powers are controlled by

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:33.400
drugs I can give you a drug that would take away all of your demons I can and

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:38.680
I'm going to show you some people who do in just a second wouldn't that be nice by the way I'm going to take you to a

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:46.040

01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:03.839
to induce mental States when that naked guy stumbles out

01:02:03.839 --> 01:02:10.839

naked guy steps up to Jesus and Bam

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:30.359
miraculously miraculously he's able to AFF a cure through his

01:02:30.359 --> 01:02:36.880
magic it's the mystery we are standing squarely looking at the Christian

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:42.839
mystery I want you I want to say one extra thing tonight and I want you to

01:02:42.839 --> 01:02:49.440
think of this I I normally don't ask people to think about anything but I'm

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:55.240
requesting I'm requesting the vision

01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:02.880
to take everything that we know about this right and to put this right into

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:08.200
practice to begin to start sending once

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:14.400
again Souls from the living to the dead and

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:20.079
bringing them back we have the ability

01:03:20.079 --> 01:03:27.839
to resurrect Jesus we have the ability ability to put the person into the state

01:03:27.839 --> 01:03:34.400
that will cause them to be born again we have the ability to go to that

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:44.680
