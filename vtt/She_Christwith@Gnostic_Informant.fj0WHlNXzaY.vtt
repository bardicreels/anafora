groom of media what happened to him what happened

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:41.640
to him let's watch the magic of the

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.959
christing that they're entering now Clyde of nestra remember what does she

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:53.800

00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:00.079
what run it back oh look Agamemnon steps in he's getting a back

00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:06.200
totally oblivious she wraps him up in a rug really fine really fine rug and then

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:12.560
she buries an axe in his brain now remember who are we talking about we're

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:20.240
talking about Bronze Age women women like the cians who were

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:29.000
spreading the burning purple who are creating the Medusa those women who have to kill

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.800
three men before they can mate they're running

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:43.200
things they're running things you should have seen the Spinx man we have to S we have to give her

virgins sorry son oh stop crying you may have

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:59.120
fun um and so her wrapping him up and cutting his brain you know splitting his

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:06.279
head open that's not necessarily surprising for the late Bronze Age for

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:13.200
the cultures that were spreading these religions their religions are who they

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.480
are when I say religion there's no faith there's no Doctrine I'm talking about

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:25.160
the practice the execution of the mystery of the mystery the act of the

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:31.000
mystery itself that one thing that everybody else on YouTube say says we don't know it's a

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.200
mystery right the people executing that this is their history now I'm goingon to

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:43.720
bring up I'm G to show you what she does does anybody want to see what the she

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:49.920
Christ does does anybody want to see what Clyde of nestra does I'm gonna have

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:56.120
a couple of women for you tonight and some things that they do and I want you

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:03.279
to notice the overlap that when you find that crisscross that radiation is the

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:10.800
history coming through it's the anthropology coming through the language oh who doesn't want that who doesn't

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:19.120
want mother Greek to caress to caress them who doesn't want

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:25.160
that you know what those Spartans we Athenians look there's two

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:31.240
things I forgot to tell you guys this last time there's two things that we've learned so for when you and I go into

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:38.240
the past and we're looking at these people you need to remember two things number one we don't been the knee to the

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:45.480
Tyrant we don't you don't get down and worship something human don't do that we

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:52.040
don't do that and number two we Athenians know that the word for

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:57.240
buttocks um proos that that word we Pro

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:03.519
proctology from it right we know that that's because of the Spartans who speak

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:11.639
terrible Greek and they um it's a reference to them engaging with the

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:19.399
kitis because that's the thing they developed that stuff down there remember Jesus the mountain right the

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:26.519
kitis that's a part that's why we call it a proos Can You Feel the actual history of

00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:31.839
that why did nobody why did I have to find that on my own why didn't somebody

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:38.959
in a classroom somewhere at some time say oh and by the way there's a Spartan history to this word

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:45.920
anus yeah yeah fantastic fantastic it's gorgeous right what did they figure out

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:52.199
just one one second to the Spartans in the group because I know you're out there I know some of you are descendants

00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:57.680
of Spartans Tom was let me give a shout out to the

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:05.440
Spartans um for the fact of they were uncompromisingly worshippers of the Gods

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:12.480
yes fantastic your Army of Lovers that was genius you had to have some brains

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.920
the Athenians can't be totally right you had to have some brains because your army was

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:26.279
interlocked physically emotionally and spiritually I wonder what would happen if we did that what if we had an army

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:32.240
you know what happens you pull in a whole different d dnamic because people are a lot more willing to fight for

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:38.079
their lovers it turns out isn't that strange it's almost like it's a it's a

00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:44.839

at this time I want you to realize that and Neil is going to have a clip of a

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:17.200
scholar and while it plays that scholar and that scholar says what he says I'm gonna be sitting in the background going

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:24.799
haha he he that's what I'm gonna be doing and maybe I don't know something else and

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:33.480
the problem is um this is the kind thing that we need to do to bust out of uh the

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:39.000
Bible and to reclaim it right to reclaim it a lot of people people didn't believe

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000
me I told you we're going to be teaching the Bible right and they even have a way for

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.600
us to do it you know how lucky those teachers are oh in Oklahoma if I were a

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:57.320
teacher in Oklahoma right now I'd be like all right I got it like I'm there

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:03.919
for you as a matter of fact I'll teach my class the Bible I'll teach your class the Bible I'll teach everybody here the

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:10.039
Bible and we're going to start in the Bible from the time Jesus Christ was

00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:15.760
arrested in a public park at 400 a.m. with a naked

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.640
Kid Mark 14 51 and 52 that's who this is

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:27.039
brought to you by the Bible that we are so lucky people the Bible is so full of

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:34.480
dirty dirty stuff it's the most dirty it's the most dirty I look at

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:41.919
people and I think do you actually know what's in there most people don't because they don't read the Greek they

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:47.399
think the original is this terrible lurgical

00:24:47.399 --> 00:24:53.720
tiny tiny vocabulary language that's absolutely terrible right the it's

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:59.000
terrible you can't convey it's like you took something beautiful

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:06.880
something something somebody produced from who had been in an art school and had worked under the great masters of

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:12.840
art you know like Michelangelo's student it's like you took that and you took

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:20.360
that work and you gave it to a seven-year-old and you were like look can you describe what you see here

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:26.799
that's what you have in the classical Hebrew because there's no Hebrew around

00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:32.480
there's no Hebrew around you're going to be shocked tonight by what this new scholar say he's not new right he's new

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:39.440

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:16.600
inducer oh God what ladies of the late

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:24.600
Bronze Age what are you people doing what are you doing they are

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:32.159
entering death and when Jesus Christ stands up and says to

00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:37.240
you you've been christed in your eyes I'm going to give you a death

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:43.080
inducer but don't worry it won't hurt you when Jesus Christ was doing that and

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:48.760
that's all from the gospels when he was doing

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:55.480
that the cult had a very very deep root

00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:04.559
in the civilization what he was doing was just tailoring it to his own

00:30:04.559 --> 00:30:12.240

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.799

energy not as energy I want you to think about it is

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:22.840
what it says in the first paragraph at the end of the at the end of it it says the activity and it says of

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:29.480
drugs the gospel is the power of the drug compound it is what it is supposed

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:37.320
to do what is the purpose of the drug the purpose is to bring

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:44.080
so salvation okay and part of that is the

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:51.880
Ina on the medical side the inera it is that activity of the drug so I want you

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:57.240
to be looking for the activity of the Christ I want you to be looking at the

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:02.720
activity of that drug okay here we go here we go give me the next one give me the next

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:08.240
one boom there we go um the next thing I want you to think about is this is

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:15.480
leading to eor right what is that what am I going to do when i e porate I'm gonna commit

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:21.240
fornication oh God no here they go again here they go again

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:26.279
fornication Idol does anybody know what fornication is fornication why don't you

00:32:26.279 --> 00:32:33.639
go fornicate I don't know sounds bad right um what do you mean it's idolatry for those of you

00:32:33.639 --> 00:32:39.919
who haven't been here for long um the act of sexual intercourse is

00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:46.600
a form of religious worship the I'm gonna say that again the

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:52.600
act of intercourse is a

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:59.320
sacred act a religious performance

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.919
whereby you should

00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:11.240
gain awareness H complete and total awareness

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:16.880
that's why we call them the

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:22.960
orgies right so that's the place that we're looking for that's the place that

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:29.679
we're trying to take the society that's why we have a again the priestesses and

00:33:29.679 --> 00:33:37.159
the bachans that's why we have them purify us do you see

00:33:37.159 --> 00:33:45.320
how the power of the religion in Antiquity in a

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:50.360
polytheistic system is to bring the

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:58.320
citizenry to the best most beautiful place right it's very democratic

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:04.440
very Democratic you want the best for your Society you want the best for them

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:11.358
you don't want to build a monest box and whoever isn't in the monest Box gets wiped out and that happens throughout

00:34:11.359 --> 00:34:18.000
history over and over and over again right and by the way by the way uh the

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.079
devil was a little bit angry with me for not for failing to mention something now

00:34:23.079 --> 00:34:28.878
it's not going to get me any big trouble but perhaps it would be better for

00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:34.040
um for me to acknowledge what he was uh what he was saying he said remind them

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:41.118
remember that the Tyrant must always

00:34:41.119 --> 00:34:49.320
dismantle and reestablish security the Tyrant will always

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:54.520
dismantle and reestablish security and that's security

00:34:54.520 --> 00:35:01.680
for the Tyrant that's not security for you and me that security for the Tyrant so I was like all right devil you're the

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:08.880
one who did it said it let's let's go for it so okay there you go take that for what it is I don't care I don't care

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:15.960
what you think please at least say something about it in the comments um by

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:22.040
the way your comments are fantastic the ones that are not fantastic are fantastic too there's some kind of

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:27.200
thrill I get some kind of weird thrill out of people who were say say negative

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:32.720
things I don't know what it is I don't know what it is um fantastic let's keep

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:38.280
going does it have anything to do with the anomos where are we going back on

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:46.720
our Trail we're going back to the person who is anomos are you anomos I want to show you what the

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:57.720
Amazonian Queens with the cyan archers I want to show you what those women think

anomos you are AOS andos do you know what you are you are a

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:23.839
monest you are someone who despises Justice you are someone

00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:29.160
without law right now why did I say

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:37.040
monest why did I say monest because monest is the person who denies the gods

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:42.240
you see you thought is a monest or is a Christian is a Jew a religious Jew or a

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:49.280
religious Muslim as that person worshiping that one God you thought you

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:54.599
were just like you clipped all the other ones off no no no what you did by

00:36:54.599 --> 00:37:00.960
rejecting everyone but the one Crea a world that was upside down in which you

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:10.800
can't have Justice anymore you can't have Justice right oh God it's it's the bakic

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:16.160
conundrum because this is the person we're here to cleanse we are here to

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:23.280
cleanse those who the Ancients called atheists namely the Christians the

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:31.160
monists right we're here we're here to free those people and the only way to

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:36.240
free them is to show them the gods is to

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:44.040
show them yeah bring back the history that's why they guard these texts so well right

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:50.640
they're powerful you think oh the biggest the the most powerful substance in the universe is that nuclear stuff

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:56.720
were messing around with yeah that's probably will be our demise but do you

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:03.880
realize the power historically of those classical texts I'm proud of all the people who

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:11.240
want to be in the in the classes I'm proud of that that's gorgeous it says a great thing it says a great thing about

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:18.240

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:51.319
the Greek phon Mal right noron what is that the soft

00:38:51.319 --> 00:38:58.319
handed law of drugs that's how you refer to the physicians's AR

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:33.680
hypocrates wrapped up and all that it's the gorgeous stuff this is all classical right this is not this is not Christian

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:40.599
at all it's not any monism there's no monism involved here in the formation of classical civilization that's one thing

00:39:40.599 --> 00:39:45.720
I need to get across people are sitting here in a democracy at least the

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:51.200
Americans right that's at least what we believe we're sitting in a democracy we

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.599
have to defend what that democracy is and that democracy didn't come from

00:39:56.599 --> 00:40:04.359
Christianity it didn't that's what they're going to be teaching in the schools here yes our

00:40:04.359 --> 00:40:12.000
friends across the pond it's coming for you next what do we have to do we have to

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.319
bring it back to him we have to show them democracy was not birthed by

00:40:18.319 --> 00:40:25.960
Christianity democracy came from polytheistic people of all sorts of

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:32.720
races right all all sorts the thing they had in common was their

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:38.960
language yeah and the fact that they were polytheists who wouldn't walk through

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:47.280
town and see the temple of justice and say that's a good thing right when you walk by your city

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:53.800
your town hall or your city mayor's office or the police station you say what a good

00:40:53.800 --> 00:41:00.319
thing right now there police may be different from cyi and archers right

00:41:00.319 --> 00:41:05.560
most the time you can Nick somebody and knock them out you know what I mean so they ought to give they ought to start

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:11.839
giving the police some kind of chemical Force that's fantastic um no don't take

00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:18.119
my suggestions what are you doing look at me jeey can you believe anybody would listen to that go what is the next

00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:24.280
Source people what's in the world today a lot of pseudo christs and a lot of pseudo

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:30.520
prophets and they're making signs they're doing signs creating signs and

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:36.839
these monstrosities and they're all to lead people astray they're all to lead people

00:41:36.839 --> 00:41:45.480
astray this is in the same gospel where Jesus in the next chapter gets arrested in a public park with a naked kid at the

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:54.400
time contemporary with Jesus Christ or pseudo christs and pseudo prophets why

00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:01.319
do pseudo Christ and pseudo prophets go together because when you get really

00:42:01.319 --> 00:42:06.880
really high that's when you can hear the angels

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:12.319
that's when you can hear the angels bro if you haven't been there sorry sorry

00:42:12.319 --> 00:42:18.839
for you sorry but if you're a follower of

00:42:18.839 --> 00:42:24.880
Christ you're gonna have to go there or else Kingdom of Heaven has nothing to do

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:30.960
with you and by the way all our boys get

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:36.440
castrated what what oh God we're back with the

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:43.400
Syrian mother again I don't think she's going to tolerate this much longer you people just wait Syrian mother is going

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:48.800
to show up and all that stuff it's gonna she's gonna be chasing it out the

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:56.839
Watchers told me that they don't just watch they can also talk give me the the next one and what happens now yeah in in

00:42:56.839 --> 00:43:02.400
these days after the um the tribulation people

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:08.160
would translate this as um the Sun is going to become dark and the moon will

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:14.480
not give off its reflective light its fangos right that gorgos that then

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:20.520

yeah it's got Hades and death and everything they're active participants all the time

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.520
right because it's written within a polytheistic culture that it then turned

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:46.119
around children and destroyed in order to set up

00:43:46.119 --> 00:43:54.160

you have to take realize your life is a figment of

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:34.120
an imagination that came from the first second and third centuries a monism that

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:40.880
destroyed your own understanding of yourself okay let's keep going let's keep going more of that Christ thing I

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.440

here's your imbrication and um here is your anointing or be smearing right okay I

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:42.840
just wanted you to see it's a lot of christing it's a lot of christing so

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:48.440
I've given you the context of what people did when they

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:55.760
actually christed and I hope that you're beginning to see where the right is

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:01.400
coming from as we look into the Bronze Age to

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:06.560
the drugs that they were first using or at least it's the first record I'm sure

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:14.480
you know I don't know how old it is but it's when we begin to see literary

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:20.719
depictions right it's when we begin to see it's at this time the late Bronze Age they're coming up with this drug

01:11:20.719 --> 01:11:27.520
Tech or at least they're employing it and um guess what ladies you're right in the middle of it you're right in the

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:33.920
middle of it and it turns out um our society is just a is just a weak

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:40.440
reflection of what that original Amazonian um

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:49.480
Democratic Oracle creating Bronze Age world where women could castrate

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:55.480
captives poison them and turn them into sex slaves

01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:02.920
when you say the good old days that's what you're talking about yeah to the Greeks these were the good old days um

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:09.800
it's you had to be there the tech was something okay I'm gonna call in Neil now and I'm gonna see look you had to

adventures yeah and he's gotten everything out of his system and now now he's come back and he's ready to hit you

01:12:28.639 --> 01:12:36.000
with some sources thank you for coming tonight um I don't want to set up your clip Neil I want you to set it up but I

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:42.360

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:57.120
and react to it we can talk about it okay turn your volume up a little bit JY says ARG turn it up

01:12:57.239 --> 01:13:02.280
how's that better yeah a little bit better okay cool there we go there we go

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:07.960
let's go with the uh first slide that I have um it's the white text not the

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:13.360
video yeah so you know he was talking about gods in the in the Bible so I'm

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:21.040
sure somebody in the crowd wants wants to see what he means by that so I pulled it up and this is the clear example of

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.800
and and you find this type of rhetoric and this type of style in the cilene OR orles which were around in the first

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:32.360
century first century BC first century ad first second century and so on they

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:37.560
and by the way cilene oracles they're written sort of in the well obviously

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:45.040
they're written in the hexamer proos like like they're written in the certain style of Greek but like Revelation which

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:50.639
isn't written in that sty same style of Greek but Revelation is like Sian orles in the sense that they're both they're

01:13:50.639 --> 01:13:56.719
both very prophetic and they used Gods as concepts of things in the world

01:13:56.719 --> 01:14:02.639
they're both very like ideas based I guess that's the way to put it but I want to throw I want to

01:14:02.639 --> 01:14:10.320
throw something at you I want to show you what he means by that and so at the end of Revelation verse 11 and I'm sorry

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:18.040
ver uh chap chapter 20 vers 11 he says Kon thron Megan lukan saw a white Throne

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:26.480
a great white throne and on it sitting who's from the face fled the gay k k

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:33.760
and so you got Gaia and arinos in the nominative singular both of them now it doesn't necessarily mean because it's in

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:40.880
the nominative singular it doesn't mean it's a person necessarily or a god necessarily it can be Heaven and Earth

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.280
but watch what's going on in this chapter that's what matters to me so it

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:51.920
so as it continues and Heaven and Earth were in in place was not found for them

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:57.040
and I saw the dead and great and small standing before the throne and the bibla

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:03.040
were opened and another bibla was opened which the which the one Zoe which was

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:09.800
the one of Zoey okay the book of Zoey and were judged the Dead the necro out

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:17.280
of the things that were written and in these biblo according to the Deeds of them and he gave up

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:25.120
thala now thala can just mean see but in the orphic hymns I have an oric HS right

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:31.199
there there's a whole dedication there's a whole sacrifice there's a whole ritual

01:15:31.199 --> 01:15:36.639
where you can actually light certain incense and set and and him and honor

01:15:36.639 --> 01:15:42.159
thala thala is a god so let's keep let's continue I think

01:15:42.159 --> 01:15:48.840
the evidence gets better as we go it says T neus and

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:55.719
alaios thos Kaio ades Hades G up so what

01:15:55.719 --> 01:16:02.239
did I just say there Thanos and Hades are there not only is thala there giving

01:16:02.239 --> 01:16:08.280
up his dead but Thanos and Hades are giving up their dead

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:13.600
and who were in them and they were judg each according to their Works uh and

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:22.840
Thanos and Hades Thanos Kyle Hades were cast into the lake of puros of

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:31.480
fire and Thanos this is the second death all right Thanos and Hades are actually

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:38.719
characters in orphic mythology or orphic you know the greater oric textual Corpus

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:45.840
if you want to call it that um and they do have their own dead Hades has his own

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:52.080
dead that he has control over he has souls that he is power over so does

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:58.679
Thanos and so does Kronos who live rules aium so does pany and there's there's

01:16:58.679 --> 01:17:05.760
also a lake of fire down there in there's no Lake of the oldest Lake of Fire we find is in the Greek is in Greek

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:11.719
mythology you don't find Lake of Fire in any Old Testament or Hebrew mythology

01:17:11.719 --> 01:17:17.760
that's a totally Greek mythology thing that you're finding in this par in this

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:23.480
chapter so I think Revelation is playing around with gods and they're being

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:30.400
judged and put by the way these are great Gods Not Just little Gods these aren't just Damons these are great Gods

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:37.840
who have orphic hymns dedicated to them all of them Theos uh thala Gaia uranos

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.960
Hades all those gods that were mentioned in this chapter all of them have specific hymns dedicated to them they'll

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:50.120
have specific um honors specific ways to sacrifice specific um uh incenses burned

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:55.480
to them so that's a really good point here I think there's some polytheism happening in the book revelation to me

01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:01.040
there's no doubt so I wanted I wanted to start off with that because the reason why I want to start off with that is

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:07.080
because this is what we find in the Mysteries and a lot lot of people will try to say well the Mysteries is a is

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:15.400
some later thing that happens as you know the same basically at the same time as Christianity you get the uh hermetic

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:22.679
Mysteries and uh what else comes around at that time uh mithraic mystery which is true those those do come later uh I

01:18:22.679 --> 01:18:29.600
think after talmy sacks uh cissa all those mithraic pirates those Lees leoy

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:36.159
they all um end up transferring their Cults over to the Romans and that's how you get the cult of mithas that's that's

01:18:36.159 --> 01:18:41.440
according to plutar not me um but that so we have a Mysteries

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:46.679
they go way back before that that's a lie I just made that I just wanted to tell you that people who say Mysteries

01:18:46.679 --> 01:18:54.040
is is a later phenomenon of the post Augustine era [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] samran Mysteries

01:18:54.040 --> 01:19:00.159
orphic Mysteries bakic Mysteries linian Mysteries all those basically go back to

01:19:00.159 --> 01:19:05.840
at least early Iron Age if not Elan and Sam thian go back to the Bronze Age the

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:13.639
mystery religions are old is as old as writing is we don't even know how old linian Mysteries are who knows and Samra

01:19:13.639 --> 01:19:19.080
Mysteries are even older than the eloian Mysteries even the eloian admitted that

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:25.920
so Sam thraa Mysteries who knows and and if you actually the little bit we do know about the Sam th Mysteries they

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:32.120
have preg Greek Archaic what they call palasan Gods the names of their gods

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:39.360
that go back before before the Greek that's how old it is that's that's what the sources say so I wanted to share I'm

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:46.639
going to share uh let me see let me stop this screen I'm gonna show I'm I got a file that I want to share um let me see where

01:19:46.639 --> 01:19:51.679
I do what I do with this file just give me a second I got some good stuff to uh

01:19:51.679 --> 01:19:56.719
to add to what ammo was saying so speaking of the Mysteries you got the

01:19:56.719 --> 01:20:05.199
word muo and if you look at percus tus and Alice you get close be shut of the

01:20:05.199 --> 01:20:12.880
eyes remember what ammo was saying he was talking about having your eyes be open by being

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:19.880
christed uh but yeah that's that's what the word means it literally just means to close

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:28.920
so uh muo means I initiate or I dis close right uh mustace is a word that's

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:37.000
used that just means initiate so the from that word muo I shut you get these

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.320
other words having to do with religion having to do with being initiated so

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:49.320
Paul talking about Christ crucified as the mystery or the secret is uh language

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:55.159
that would have caught the ear of the God-fearing Greek in the time period and

01:20:55.159 --> 01:21:01.280
would have said Mysteries oh I love mysteries what do you got for me I'll be initiated give me a baptism give me a

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:07.040
Christ give me some Eucharist in fact we have some sources on that so let's talk

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:14.000
about that so this by the way I wrote Marcus Magus down here because I have him in my notes and I was supposed I was

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.639
trying to write um dores that's not Marcus Magus this is diores I don't know

01:21:19.639 --> 01:21:27.199
why I wrote that but he did Das scories did die in 90 ad so that is true so I got that part right diores is going to

01:21:27.199 --> 01:21:34.639
be the subject of the next couple minutes he died in 90 ad he's a contemporary running around with Paul

01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:40.760
maybe he was even Paul's plug who who knows maybe Paul was buying his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off this [Laughter]

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:47.760
guy but anyways the the verse that I wanted to to uh to address here is porur

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:53.199
Kaa which I'm gonna cite Al booy here I'm I got to cite Al boy this is a

01:21:53.199 --> 01:21:59.040
screenshot from one of Al Boy videos where he he he translates as the burning

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:04.560
purple um now I was trying to I wanted to translate it myself too and I I I

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:10.000
think it's the um let's see what has he got he's got he's got the aist

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.639
active I think it's the Eric's passive but I could be wrong I could be wrong

01:22:16.639 --> 01:22:21.679
I'm just saying I just want I want to see what what people think about that I'm throwing that out there we can go back to that we can Circle back to that

01:22:21.679 --> 01:22:29.159
I'm not trying to start nothing but it wouldn't even make a difference if it will make a slight difference it would be the burnt purple the purple that's

01:22:29.159 --> 01:22:35.280
been burnt whereas in the air is active it's the burning purple

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:40.400
now the reason why I bring that up is because diores talks about this burnt

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:46.000
purple where he says it has these different uses and there's all you can

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.719
use it to clean wounds you can use it to clean scars you use it for checking overgrown flesh whatever that means and

01:22:52.719 --> 01:22:59.360
it's a detersive of the teeth cleans your teeth out which is odd because you see a lot of teeth cleaners these days

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:06.239
that are actually purple I don't know if you guys know that go to the go to the go to your local store Cosmetics store

01:23:06.239 --> 01:23:13.719
and go to the teeth cleaning stuff you'll see there's like purple teeth cleaners out there and I almost wonder I wonder if they re discover rediscovered

01:23:13.719 --> 01:23:19.679
decor's methods of cleaning teeth just saying you never know but uh yeah so

01:23:19.679 --> 01:23:26.199
okay that's that I'm gonna lay that's the Dan clip that I have saved for for when I need it so I'm going to go to I

01:23:26.199 --> 01:23:32.800
have one more thing I got to show burning since we're on the topic of burning purple or the burnt purple

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:39.239
whichever it is um I want to share my last screen before I get to

01:23:39.239 --> 01:23:46.480
that video and that is that is this so this is a story we

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:53.080
get this is a story we get from hippopus at the end of the second century I think

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:58.360
early third Maybe but anyways he's talking about a guy named Marcus who lived in the second

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:05.520
century now before I read this story I want you to realize how big of a deal this guy is he gets his

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:13.960
own entire multiple chapters dedicated just to him where most most um most

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:20.080
Heretics get like a paragraph or a page or a sentence Marcus gets multiple pages

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:27.920
and he gets multiple books dedicated just to himself only Marcus valentinus by the way Marcus was

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:35.199
the successor of valentinus we're going to get into that the valentinians were a huge I think they were the mystery the

01:24:35.199 --> 01:24:42.440
earliest I think they represent the earliest strata of Christianity but we'll get into that we'll get into that too but anyways the naine preacher who

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:47.800
we don't know his real name valentinus and Marcus they get the

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:55.280
most most uh action in these TXS they get the most um they're the most serious

01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:02.600
by far and it's because of how much power they had it turns out this is not just me like spewing nonsense anybody

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:09.480
this is like well-known agree this is like consensus stuff or I'm about the marians who are in offshoot of the

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:15.400
valentinians are the largest growing faction of Christianity in France in the

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:21.920
second and third and fourth Century all the way into they like they they were there for a while apparently and they

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:28.400
got their name from this guy so European Christianity comes from this

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:35.040
wa what you're about to hear all right let's let's read this story but there is another among

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:40.679
them of these Heretics Marcus by name who boasts himself as having improved

01:25:40.679 --> 01:25:47.719
upon his master he is a perfect Adept in magical impostures and by this means

01:25:47.719 --> 01:25:53.560
drawing a great number of men and not a few women he has induced them to join

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:59.800
themselves to him as to one who is possessed of the greatest nosis and Perfection that's

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:07.239
what the word actually is but and who has received the highest power from the invisible and ineffable regions above

01:26:07.239 --> 01:26:13.520
thus it appears if as if he really were the precursor of antichrist for joining

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:18.760
the buffoon of anoos of the craftiness of the Magi that's why he gets his

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:25.320
nickname from Marcus Magus Marcus maggus as they are called he is regarded

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:30.600
by his senseless and crack brain followers working miracles as by these

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:36.080
means What miracles pretending to consecrate cups mixed with wine the

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:41.840
Eucharist obviously and protracting to Great length the word of invocation he

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:47.760
contrives to give them a purple and reddish color remember the

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:53.880
purple we we talked about this all the time sometimes it's a dark red Crimson doesn't have to be purple sometimes it

01:26:53.880 --> 01:27:00.760
can be a little on the on the reddish side so here we got a good candidate for this right here purple and reddish color

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:07.520
so what does he say here by the way I love this translation the one that I was going to use translates this to Grace

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:14.440
this person kept the word Caris they actually transliterate I love it because that it makes you it makes you hear the

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:22.080
Greek it makes you hear the original context so I'm going to read it so that Caris who is one of those and the other

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:28.199
one says so that the grace Superior all things like he just totally changes the translation but this is what it really

01:27:28.199 --> 01:27:34.560
says so that Caris who is one of those that are superior to all things should

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:41.360
be thought to drop her own blood into that cup through means of his invocation

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:48.000
and that thus those who are present should be led to Rejoice to taste that

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:56.560
cup in order that by so doing Caris who is set forth by this Magi may also flow

01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:03.320
into them and again handing mixed cups to the women he bids them consecrate

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:09.840
these in his presence when this has been done he himself produces another cup of

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:15.360
much larger size than that which the diluted women have consecrated and

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:22.119
pouring from the smaller consecrated by the women into that which has been brought forth so he's basically explaining how he drugs them and stuff

01:28:22.119 --> 01:28:28.800
whatever he does this is like he has a slight of hand going on he's got a small cup and a big cup the drugs are in the small cup and they're not looking he

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:35.360
dips it he's drugging he's drugging these girls this is not this is Wild by the

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:43.159
way I just want to I'm G to stop here just to give you some context his student that he succeeded he

01:28:43.159 --> 01:28:49.760
they consider in it's in this text somewhere where he says that this is the successor of valentinus I think it's in

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:57.199
the chapter before this where he says that he's a student of valentinus who was the second highest Bishop in

01:28:57.199 --> 01:29:04.320
Rome in the 150s of the Common Era 140s actually I'm sorry 140s so

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:11.080
valentinus was the SEC had the second highest amount of votes to become the bishop of Rome and if that would have

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:17.400
happened he would be on your list I got my Catholic Bible right

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:23.480
here if you open up your Catholic Bible it's got the list of succession of popes

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:29.560
he was on this list now I know some Scholars will say but they weren't popes in the beginning they didn't the bishop

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:37.440
of Rome didn't have that much power I don't care I'm looking at this list and I see henus and I see telesphorus and

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:42.719
see pasus from 140 to 155 pasus is the guy I think it was

01:29:42.719 --> 01:29:47.800
either hainus or Pi I think it was hainus 136 to 140 so it was even earlier

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:55.280
than I thought this is even earlier than I thought this is in the 130s henus is on the list henus is the

01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:01.280
guy that beat valentinus out for votes by a couple of votes I'm telling you it was only a couple of votes that's what

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:08.480
the sources say now just let that sink in the successor to that guy whose

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:14.400
church almost became the Church of Rome very close or at least he would have been steering the ship a little bit more

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:20.280
in his own Direction who knows we don't know we don't know what would happened maybe nothing happened who knows I'm just saying there was that's what would

01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:25.800
have happened so he says he says this this is that guy and by the way marosan

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:32.920
are known are known to be the the biggest church in France in the second and third Century after this guy so it

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:39.639
says pouring from the smaller one consecrated by the women into that which has been brought forward by himself he

01:30:39.639 --> 01:30:46.000
at the same time pronounces these words may that Caris who is before all things

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.480
and who transcends all knowledge and speech fill your inner man and multiply

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:57.639
in you her own knowledge by sowing the grain of mustard seed in you as in good

01:30:57.639 --> 01:31:02.719
soil repeating certain other like words and thus goting on The Wretched woman to

01:31:02.719 --> 01:31:08.800
Madness he then appears a worker of Wonders so they're tripping balls off

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:15.159
this stuff and they're probably seeing visions of Christ and Mary or whatever and there he's probably saying see it's

01:31:15.159 --> 01:31:20.920
my Eucharist told you and uh that's how he does it so they basically talk about

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:26.520
and then he says it appears probable enough that this man possesses a demon

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:32.360
as his familiar Spirit by means of whom he seems able to prophecy so he's

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:37.960
basically he's pulling off this guy's admitting that whoever whatever this guy's doing he's pulling off prophecy

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:43.679
and it's working and also enables as many as he counts worthy to be partakers

01:31:43.679 --> 01:31:49.920
of of his Caris themselves to prophecy he devotes himself especially to women

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:57.000
and those such who are well bred and elegantly attired and have great wealth whom he frequently seeks to draw after

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:03.159
him by addressing them in such seductive words as these I am eager to make you a

01:32:03.159 --> 01:32:09.000
partaker of my grace Caris since the father of all does continually behold

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.040
your angel before his face now the place of your angel is Among Us these are his

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:21.800
words this is this is a quote from him let me start that over this is a quote from Marcus I am eager to make you

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:28.440
partake of my Caris since the father of all does continually behold your angel

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:34.360
before his face whatever that means now the place of your angel is Among Us it

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:42.000
behooves us to become one receive first from me and by the gift of Caris Adorn

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:48.199
yourself as a bride who is expecting her BR bridegroom that you may be what I am

01:32:48.199 --> 01:32:54.920
and what you are establish the germ of light in your nupal chamber receive from

01:32:54.920 --> 01:33:01.800
me a spouse and become receptive of him while you are received by him behold

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:08.840
Caris has descended upon you open your mouth in Prophecy and the woman replying I have

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:14.560
never at any time prophecied nor do I know how to prophecy then engaging for

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:21.080
the second time in certain invocations as to Astound his diluted victim he says

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:27.920
to her open your mouth speak speak whatsoever occurs to you and you shall

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:33.719
prophecy since then vainly puffed up and elad by these words and greatly excited

01:33:33.719 --> 01:33:39.320
in Soul by the expectation that is herself who is the prophecy her heart

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:45.880
beating violent by the way shout out to hippius for writing this this is good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] her heart beating violently from

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:52.360
emotion reaches though requisite requisite pitch of audacity and ID idly

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:57.600
as well as impudently utters some nonsense as it happens to occur to her

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:04.600
such as might be expected from one he from an empty Spirit referring to this one Superior to me has observed that the

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:11.760
soul is both audacious and impudent when heated with empty air henceforth she

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:18.440
reckons herself a prophetess I wonder what AM thinks about that heeded part henceforth she reckons herself as a

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:23.719
prophetess and expresses her thanks to Marcus for having imparted to her of his

01:34:23.719 --> 01:34:30.320
his own Caris she then makes the effort to reward him not only by the gift of her possessions in which he has

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:36.040
collected a large very Fortune by the way there's probably some trueth to this because like I said he goes on to start

01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:42.560
the biggest church in all of France he basically brings Christianity to the

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:48.440
Galls basically he's like he's like known for that then it says but already some of

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:54.480
the most faithful women possessed of the fear of God and not being deceived

01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:01.360
uh aboring and ex excreting him have withdrawn from such vile company of revelers this they have done as being

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:07.000
well aware that the gift of Prophecy whoops what did I just do oh here we go

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:14.320
okay so Mark so it is is not conferred on men by Marcus the magician Marcus the maggus but that only those to whom God

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:21.119
sends his care his grace from above possesses divinely inspired so he's talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know last thing I

01:35:21.119 --> 01:35:26.320
wanted to show on this part is right here he says Marcus compounds filters

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:32.000
and love potions this guy loves drugs and purple

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:39.360
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right and it says in order to insult the persons of some of these women if not all of them those of them

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:45.840
who have returned to the Church of God a thing frequently occurs have acknowledged confessing too that they

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:52.639
have been defiled by him wow and that they were filled with a burning passion

01:35:52.639 --> 01:35:59.600
towards him a sad example of this occurred in the case of a certain Asiatic one of our

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:05.480
deacons who had received him why are they all getting tricked by him if he's so's so evil how are they all going back

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:12.239
to him all the time something something's going on here who had received him into his house his wife a

01:36:12.239 --> 01:36:17.280
woman of remarkable Beauty fell a victim both in mind and Beauty to this magician

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:23.119
and for a long time traveled about with him at last with no small difficulty the

01:36:23.119 --> 01:36:28.520
brethren had converted her she spent her whole time in exercise of public confession blah blah blah blah blah but

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:33.679
that yeah anyways he's a Magus he makes a lot of drugs

01:36:33.679 --> 01:36:40.119
um he says and they say they assert that they themselves know more than all others and that they alone have ided the

01:36:40.119 --> 01:36:46.520
greatness of the nosis of the knowledge of what is unspeakable the Mysteries so what I

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:51.800
think when I when I'm reading something like this this shows me even though

01:36:51.800 --> 01:37:00.080
hippius who's writing this 50 years later he's writing this 50 years later hippius is not a primary source to oh

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:07.000
he's a primary source that we're reading him but he's not a primary um witness to these events he's writing about

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.719
something that happened 50 years before him so when I read this and I think hpus

01:37:12.719 --> 01:37:20.360
is looking back at an older time of Christianity happening in the 130s 130s of the Common Era 130s and

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:26.119
140s and this is a time where Christianity is looking way different different and that's what this tells me

01:37:26.119 --> 01:37:32.560
this tells me that the the Christians who were in charge and running the churches were doing way different [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:39.400
they were doing and it was way more mystery mystery like a lot more Eucharist and baptisms and as you can

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:45.040
see here this guy's going his own extra route and adding purple drugs to the Eucharist not sure how many other

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:50.960
churches were doing that I mean I would guess maybe there more than one right

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:58.639
just saying what do you think about that yeah you you found him right

01:37:58.639 --> 01:38:03.920
everybody put your hands up the cops are all all outside right you found him you

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:09.320
you got them surrounded good FBI job yeah this was your clip too real quick

01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:15.960
there's a joke about the Mysteries so one one of this is actually one of um diogenes's students I have this I had

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:22.960
this text right here from dienes syic and one of his students is named theodoros there's a story about this guy

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:30.440
Theodor and one day theodoris was sitting besides a hero Fant Ur clades and he

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:36.040
says tell me e clades who are those who violate the

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:41.360
Mysteries when the herant replied those who reveal them to the

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:47.480
uninitiated theodoris then said you guys this is this is you know you know he's learned from diogenes how to be slick he

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:54.199
says then you yourself are violating them when you expound them to the uninitiated because you have to you have

01:38:54.199 --> 01:39:00.960
to reveal the Mysteries to the UN initiate in order to initiate them and this is what it says after that he would

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:06.400
hardly have escaped from being hauled in front of the court of arop pegos if

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:11.599
Demetrius of feron had not come to his rescue there's Demetrius poing up in our

01:39:11.599 --> 01:39:18.760
history books again he's everywhere bravo bravo hit the clip show

01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:25.520
these people set it up look what you found this is like a this is an expose that Neil's got going on I'm serious

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:32.639
this is like huge Renaissance business show do does your clip on the bottom

01:39:32.639 --> 01:39:38.480
play or do I have to play my own because I don't know if I downloaded yet my own most Scholars would say the

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:48.199
Moses tradition probably started being written down uh in the 700s um maybe the late 800s BCE they are

01:39:48.199 --> 01:39:53.679
probably writing the Moses stories down sometime in the 700s BC

01:39:53.679 --> 01:39:59.719
what would you say to that so okay so when I hear uh a claim of that sort or

01:39:59.719 --> 01:40:07.080
any Claim about when let's say a Biblical text was written uh the first question that I'll ask is how do you

01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:12.280
know that and I expect an answer that's

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:19.119
compelling the answer can't be well uh most Scholars think that whatever I will

01:40:19.119 --> 01:40:28.639
continue and I will ask well how do these Scholars know that right in in in in good historical work you need to show

01:40:28.639 --> 01:40:34.360
evidence for any claim that you make I'm simply trying to put on the table what

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:39.920
it is that we know and what it is that we don't know and I look backwards in time start with the first century of the

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:45.199
Common Era and go backwards to the first century before the Common Era to the

01:40:45.199 --> 01:40:51.880
second century before the Common Era to the third Century before the Common Era prior to this time the trail of evidence

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:57.239
ends we we know longer find archaeological evidence or textual

01:40:57.239 --> 01:41:02.719
evidence which point to widespread observance of the Torah or in fact any

01:41:02.719 --> 01:41:09.719
kind of observance of the Torah uh in actuality the fact that we don't have any references to any of the biblical

01:41:09.719 --> 01:41:14.850
texts stories [Music]

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:23.800
laws did it pause I didn't pause it I can continue with though I got I got the clip right here so wait it's

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:29.639
probably on our end all right because the the last part is pretty good all right

01:41:29.639 --> 01:41:34.920
ready is it playing down uh in the s or

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:40.320
textual evidence which point to widespread observance of the Torah or in

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:45.520
fact any kind of observance of the Torah uh in actuality the fact that we don't

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:51.360
have any references to any of the biblical texts stories laws the fact

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:56.960
that we have a practice which go against which

01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:04.920
contravene Torah law for example we find images of Athena now these are copies of Greek

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:13.520
coins we find them being minted in Judea with the term the name yehud yudal

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.960
the name of the Judean Province I I find in my discussions with

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:27.280
Scholars often times people just they don't get what I'm doing right to me it seems so obvious but it's not

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:34.639
clear to them that this is a question that we can look into and and and

01:42:34.639 --> 01:42:41.239
investigate and and think about it you know what are ordinary people doing to to me it's the simplest question of all

01:42:41.239 --> 01:42:47.960
the earliest evidence that we have for the Torah being observed is from middle

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:52.719
of the 2 Century before the common ero

01:42:54.040 --> 01:43:01.880
[Music] wow he goes farther than Gad bar goes

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:08.920
now the reason why this interview is a little bit different and it has better information I think because it's more

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:14.360
it's more it's worse than we thought it's worse than I thought because here and we didn't even we didn't even talk

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:21.719
about this but it's in his book he writes this in his book no circumcision no evidence of circumcision

01:43:21.719 --> 01:43:28.480
until the 1th s a BC so before it's like we're you and I are probably thinking oh

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:35.679
probably around 300 when they get the when they make the SE two agent you know everyone's goingon to start following no no one gave a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no one's following it

01:43:35.679 --> 01:43:41.159
it's just there it's just there for elite circles to read about kind of like how people have Plato's laws but they're

01:43:41.159 --> 01:43:46.920
not following Plato's laws they're just reading it it's like that um it's like a philosophical treaties text it's one of

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:53.960
those like because there's there's a lot of these laws laying around in this time period it's not just the Torah it's not just Plato other people writing no most

01:43:53.960 --> 01:44:01.360
no mo is a popular thing to write now he says this no

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:07.360
circumcision no synagogues they're they're eating pork

01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:14.599
they're eating shellfish they're sacrificing to other gods they're making images of Greek and Pagan and Egyptian

01:44:14.599 --> 01:44:20.440
gods all over the place no no mention like so it's like

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:26.800
they're not there this this place that we call Israel is just another Mediterranean place just like every

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:33.320
other part of the Mediterranean World until not the 300s until the has minian

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:39.080
period until the 150s BC that's when they start to shift

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:44.119
and change their culture into a worshiping one God following the

01:44:44.119 --> 01:44:49.639
Torah that's when they start it's it's it's even worse than we

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:56.679
thought middle of the second century BC is what he says before that they're all

01:44:56.679 --> 01:45:04.920
polytheistic pagans like everyone else they're just they're just Mediterranean people like everyone else why is that worse I kind of think

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:09.960
that's better if it's accurate I kind of think it's better you know what I mean no it's better it's better for you and

01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:15.080
me and and for for everybody because it frees people from this yeah this thing

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:22.000
of like oh this this part of the world is different and there's you know we have to like treat this part of the world as like holy and sacred it's like

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.880
no it's just another another Mediterranean land like everyone else yeah so when I say worse I mean it's

01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:35.360
worse for like the fundamentalist types who are like oh Moses you know wrote the Torah in 1300 bce. and now King David

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:42.040
and King Solomon and and King Josiah and his reforms all that all happened no it didn't happen what reforms are you

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:47.520
making if nobody's even doing anything right right there's no reforms to be had

01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:53.440
right doesn't doesn't make any sense King the idea of King by the way there's not one mention of Josiah anywhere

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:59.520
outside the [Laughter] Bible made up right there's no letter to

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:04.440
pharaoh to King to King Josiah just doesn't

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:12.440
exist that can I ask was it refreshing to get somebody whose

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:19.159
standard was evidence right we're not the Theology and all that stuff none of

01:46:19.159 --> 01:46:25.679
that stuff matters Right the dude is digging in the dirt by the way some of somebody just sent me an article that

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:32.239
they found a ring a gold ring in hia and it had the imprint of manerva on it

01:46:32.239 --> 01:46:40.400
right and they wanted to know what I thought I I think I wrote back and said are you surprised right it's well

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:45.560
predating there was no Moses at the time that that ring was there there was no

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:52.040
Moses right that's a cre it's a later creation yeah some Bible Believers will

01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:58.440
be shocked to know that Moses what do you mean Moses isn't around in 450 BCE that's way late in the game in their

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:03.639
opinion but he's not around yet in 450 BCE and they have Athena on their coin

01:47:03.639 --> 01:47:08.920
there's not they don't have Moses on their coin like we have Abraham Lincoln on our coins they didn't have Moses and

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:14.199
Abraham on their money they have Athena and Zeus on their money Zeus holding the

01:47:14.199 --> 01:47:20.199
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] eagle and they worship the Zodiac of

01:47:20.199 --> 01:47:25.560
ion right they do it's in the C OG they're sitting there right right by the

01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:34.440
way synagogue is a Greek word you got to think about that for a minute you know what I mean it's amazing NE have you have you

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:40.520
as you're doing all this research and as you're pulling down all of the views of

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:46.000
the late Bronze Age and then down iron and then finally The Classical

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:53.040
Greece um are you getting some kind of picture of movements of people in this

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:59.119
you know basically a sea based world right and it's you got movements

01:47:59.119 --> 01:48:04.880
of people throughout this area and some of those people are going through are

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:10.840
going through the you know what you call Judea right or Palestine people are

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:16.080
going through them those people have Greek they they do have there's Greek

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:23.639
blood all over the place there's genetics all over yeah those Phoenician Punic are

01:48:23.639 --> 01:48:29.320
Mediterranean to the core yeah they're I mean they have a they have a different language they're semetic people of

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:35.400
course they have and they they're using the same alphabet but they you know they have their own like way of they have their own like I guess you could say

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:40.520
it's like a font if you think about it because it's all they're all it's all the same alphabet it's the alpha beta

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:47.520
but they have their own Pantheon of equivalents of Kronos of of

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:53.080
Zeus who they call Bal Ammon that's what they call them that's that's their Zeus

01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:58.480
and they have uh they have all their have Ashman who they say is and this there's actually they have a we found a

01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:04.119
bilingual text it's an it's half Punic and half Greek or Latin I can't it's

01:49:04.119 --> 01:49:10.800
Latin actually is it Latin I think it is it's one of those two but one of them has

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:16.560
Adonis and the other one has Ashman and it's like so that you could see how they're like equating those Gods

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:22.119
together anyways but it's a bilingual it's like the it's like the um res but I wanted to mention something about the

01:49:22.119 --> 01:49:28.719
Dan the Dan in the beginning of that clip they always say this we we we

01:49:28.719 --> 01:49:35.800
Scholars think that Moses was being written down around the 700s why this is what I want to know why 700s why not

01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:42.360
900s why not a thousand because it's the same thing to me you're just guessing you're just making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up with no

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:49.199
evidence and just going May it's possible that Moses just slipped through the cracks and that no one figured out

01:49:49.199 --> 01:49:56.599
who he was until the helenistic period and that all there's only a small group of of of elitist people in in Jerusalem

01:49:56.599 --> 01:50:04.360
who wrote about Moses why are they writing about Moses and not telling anybody what the hell's the point of that it's a very it's a very weird so me

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:10.159
and dererk were talking about this we're calling it The Torah of the gaps argument you ever heard of the god of the gaps

01:50:10.159 --> 01:50:17.159
argument so people who people who try to argue about like God being in control of everything will say like oh they used to

01:50:17.159 --> 01:50:22.360
think rain was sent by the gods now they know rain is is you know is caused by

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:29.040
cond ation or whatever and so like God kind of moves back into the areas that we don't know where he is right so now

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:36.599
it's just like he's outside of space in time monism right they do the same thing for the Torah wherever we if we look for

01:50:36.599 --> 01:50:43.400
the Torah we look for evidence of the Torah or Mo stories about Moses or just anybody writing about Moses or Abraham

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:50.159
or anything just mentioning Abraham or Noah you can't find it it's just not

01:50:50.159 --> 01:50:57.119
there so it becomes this thing of it becomes argument of the Torah of the gaps where we can't find them the

01:50:57.119 --> 01:51:02.480
average Joe doesn't know who Moses is uh the farmer doesn't know who Moses is the

01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:07.679
soldiers don't know who Moses is so it must just be some really small Priestly

01:51:07.679 --> 01:51:12.840
class sitting up in Jerusalem by themselves writing writing Legends for nobody but

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:18.599
themselves it sounds crazy does it does and that was the only

01:51:18.599 --> 01:51:23.960
beef I had with your guest um was it he said you got to really Iz and as soon as

01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:31.040
you hear them generalizing you know um that they're going to mess up by the way the best Scholars can fall into this

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:37.679
trap yeah so I'm not I'm not saying this dude is an excellent scholar he sounded like it to me yeah and I was really

01:51:37.679 --> 01:51:43.199
impressed with how he handled evidence so but when he generalized and it's easy

01:51:43.199 --> 01:51:51.079
to step in this trap when he generalized and was talking about well you know in Antiquity um books were just for the

01:51:51.079 --> 01:51:56.440
elite right and you had to have a lot of money and a lot of hoo-ha and a lot of

01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:03.400
education and when he was saying that I thought what do you think the gymnasia were they were teaching people Homer you

01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:09.040
sent theater theater you sent your kids to school to learn Homer's grammar what

01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:17.159
do what do you mean there were 50,000 50,000 Scrolls in the alexandrian

01:52:17.159 --> 01:52:25.000
library who do you think is reading all those Scrolls you think it's just a few Elite people that's an old argument that

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:32.079
I've heard in Classics for the longest time but here's the thing though and it doesn't stand up I I totally am fine

01:52:32.079 --> 01:52:37.440
with their the idea that only a very select can read and write that even if

01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:43.320
that's the case let's grant that fine it doesn't matter because they can still tell the stories to people and they

01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:49.960
they're still gonna so you still have the theater you still have Homer being played out as a song for people who

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:55.199
can't read and write to listen to so even if even if that's true that only a

01:52:55.199 --> 01:53:01.159
small certain people can read and write it doesn't mean they're not going to be able to tell people's stories people want to know stories people are sitting

01:53:01.159 --> 01:53:06.639
around at campfires every single night they don't they don't do anything else

01:53:06.639 --> 01:53:12.679
so if there's a legend somewhere about some hero they're gonna want to know about it there's no way that's not gonna

01:53:12.679 --> 01:53:18.920
get out there it just doesn't make sense at all that people would secretly have their own little secret clicks of Legend

01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:25.040
writing yeah that do just doesn't make any sense no no and let's remember it's

01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:32.800
not all the Greeks because the Spartans were the You Know Not only was their Greek bad but they tried to Outlaw stuff

01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:38.480
like theatrical performances and reading and stuff like that the Spartans were

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:44.000
far more like modern evangelicals than the evangelicals realize if you think

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.840
about how their culture was and how they viewed people in the world what their

01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:55.719
big view was you want to say world view um yeah and you want to think about why

01:53:55.719 --> 01:54:02.280
why things mean that they do because the Spartans are the ones who are into that right um you know what's funny about

01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:09.440
that is the Spartans um there's a You're gonna laugh Josephus Josephus has a letter supposed

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:14.760
letter from the king of the Spartans writing to the king or the high priest or somebody to the Jews I don't know who

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:22.000
I can't remember who but it's it's preserved in Josephus and the king of the Spartans tells the Jews we're we're

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.639
we're all sons of Abraham together I figured you laugh at that for

01:54:28.639 --> 01:54:34.920
what you just said yeah that's good that's good I like

01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:40.679
that I like that yeah um and it fits you know it fits but we Athenians we're not

01:54:40.679 --> 01:54:46.239
going to do that we got we've got things like democracy and that's a big deal to

01:54:46.239 --> 01:54:53.280
us I thought it was a fantastic interview I thought you did a fantastic job how um was there any from it you

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:58.599
just wanted to say hey it's it you know it's also important that he was able to

01:54:58.599 --> 01:55:04.400
show me this because obviously he moved your timeline down right you lost like a

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:10.040
century off of of Jewish history right it's like well it didn't go back that

01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:16.079
far right it just wasn't around that's you know what you know what you know what makes it makes me realize because

01:55:16.079 --> 01:55:23.520
if this is true that people are like let's let's put this timeline together

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:29.840
Judaism did not exist before 300 BC just did not exist there is no such thing as

01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:34.960
Judaism before that everyone's polytheistic you get these texts put

01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:41.760
together at this at this time around the 300s around the early three 270 to 300

01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:46.880
whatever and then it s and then it sits there and it's just sort of like just

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:52.960
kind of just it just belongs to a certain you know group of alexandrian Jews who are interested in stuff and

01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:59.840
then the jerusalemites take it back to the to their city and they had these texts the average person is not reading

01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:06.199
that text yet not right away it takes a century and a half for people to start

01:56:06.199 --> 01:56:11.239
knowing about this Torah and it's like finally all of a sudden according to the

01:56:11.239 --> 01:56:17.000
the evidence of the archaeology in the 150s and it actually makes sense that

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:22.840
it's the 150s because it's right after the haian revolt and the Haan Vault

01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:28.360
according to the text itself makes it clear that there was a huge conservative

01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:35.840
push in Judea to follow only Yahweh and to follow the Mosaic law so it's finally

01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:44.639
around the 150s BCE when Judaism becomes a thing and then only 150 years later

01:56:44.639 --> 01:56:51.320
Jesus is born Christianity is not that far off from Judaism you the PE most people

01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:56.400
think Judaism is like thousands of years before Christianity no they're like in

01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:05.079
almost a century apart from each other it's it they're the they come at the same time yeah of History just like the

01:57:05.079 --> 01:57:15.480
worship of aten um and the monism in Egypt in the 14th BC um you can see um Mediterranean

01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:21.800
Society was free of monism until the first second late

01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:27.280
second first what what date would you put it at when does the monism you know

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:32.760
what you're not gonna like this but I but I read a lot of presocratic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah those presocratic flirted with

01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:38.560
monism but not in the way not in like monotheistic way just in a sense that

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:45.560
they believe and this is very platonic Plato thought this too and Plato and some of the presocratic before Plato

01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:50.679
were FES one of these the ark the one the first one the prince the highest the

01:57:50.679 --> 01:57:57.079
one the hen and they thought that there was this one above all the cosmos and

01:57:57.079 --> 01:58:05.159
and the co and this this one produces you know Eros from uh from from the

01:58:05.159 --> 01:58:10.599
chaos and then you get so they they still accept hiad they still accept

01:58:10.599 --> 01:58:19.400
Homer but they're what they're doing is they're saying that these gods are under some one so that idea that that monism

01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:26.800
idea to me starts around around the SE 65th Century BCE where you get monism

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:32.880
and I think it's a presocratic idea but like I said it's not in the way that people are not in the way that it's

01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:38.560
done by judeans and Christians in the first century it's not they they take

01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:44.199
monism they put it on steroids right right so because the the the PRI retics

01:58:44.199 --> 01:58:50.280
were very specific about the one there is no you and I don't even talk to this one we have me we have dammons in

01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:56.040
between we cannot talk to the one it's too it's way beyond our comprehension this is what they would this is what

01:58:56.040 --> 01:59:01.119
this is what heraclitus would say or parmin okay so if you're tracing it if

01:59:01.119 --> 01:59:07.079
you're tracing it through the Greek presocratic doesn't it make

01:59:07.079 --> 01:59:12.719
sense that the septu is the original language these

01:59:12.719 --> 01:59:18.199
people are coming through Alexandria being educated in Greek and Alexandria

01:59:18.199 --> 01:59:24.000
doesn't it make much more historical sense that Hebrew is not the original

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:30.800
language that this is a Greek work that's filtering through Greek ideas

01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:37.560
that you you just pointed out um the influence of mother Greek was so great

01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:43.119
that Hebrew was nothing then it was nothing it was lurgical it was gone as a

01:59:43.119 --> 01:59:49.960
matter of fact I don't think we can even say it was lurgical anymore because if you're saying Judaism gets here starts

01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:56.239
being practiced as a as a monest religion in the second or first

01:59:56.239 --> 02:00:02.719
century um yeah we have to say yeah those Traditions are fake there's no

02:00:02.719 --> 02:00:07.840
they didn't have any Traditions that's that's when they bring back Hebrew and they they start writing in Hebrew at

02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:13.320
that time because they're writing they're writing in Greek before that they are right no and they're speaking

02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:20.159
Greek they all have Greek names aristobulus is a name arist he like

02:00:20.159 --> 02:00:27.840
reformers you know what I mean people and people don't understand they think the um Jews in Alexandria

02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:33.880
were all reactive against talism they weren't right there's plenty of the

02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:42.840
population that had been speaking Greek had raised been raised Greek and had access to Greek education that you don't

02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:48.239
you don't need you don't need another class of people to follow it youve got

02:00:48.239 --> 02:00:54.440
people who are supporting it you know what I mean so just like mon just like monism is an idea that seems

02:00:54.440 --> 02:01:03.040
to been have been like played around with by the presocratic Greeks the platonist and Plato himself in his nomoy

02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:08.320
in his laws wrote about the gymnasium being a place of evil and you can tell

02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:15.760
this is Plato late in his life he's a an old loser because you read Plato's earlier works I love early Plato in the

02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:21.000
in the Symposium was amazing writing about OS and love and dianis but this

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:27.320
later Plato homosexuality is wicked evil you need to get rid of it the gymnasium needs to be

02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:32.560
eradicated he's turning into like a conservative like full-blown and those

02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:37.960
ideas I think and so does gin think that's what you get with I think Judaism

02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:45.320
is is uh being influenced by platonism that's what I think is happening I think it's like platonism on

02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:51.639
steroids yeah you know I think some great thinkers would think alike like n

02:01:51.639 --> 02:01:57.599
with say the same thing um yeah they saw that classical origin that classical

02:01:57.599 --> 02:02:04.440
font and when people realize oh your religion goes back to this like hey by the way and this is my next question

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:12.599
people are gonna say that you are crazy if you start showing them that

02:02:12.599 --> 02:02:19.599
Judaism began um as late as a second and first uh what are you gonna do I mean

02:02:19.599 --> 02:02:26.480
how what are you gonna do exactly what what janathan Edler said when I asked

02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:33.800
him when I when I re when I paraphrased what um what what uh what's his name Dan

02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:40.280
said 700s I'm gonna say how do you know that show me the evid like look we have

02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:46.440
evidence of we know we know what it looks like we know what archaeolog archaeological sites looks like we know

02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:52.360
there was people in Egypt doing circumcision we even know there's other places doing circumcision like up in the

02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:58.599
north um in I think Assyria they're doing certain types of it so this it's

02:02:58.599 --> 02:03:07.079
this practice is around but they're not doing it in Judea all the way up until 150s nobody's doing it and that's one of

02:03:07.079 --> 02:03:14.040
the most important laws in the according to the story of Abraham seventh day your child should be circumcised they're not

02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:19.719
doing it and they're eating pork and they're worshiping other gods and they're minting coins with Athena on it

02:03:19.719 --> 02:03:25.320
so my my thing would be is where's show me where people are starting to to show

02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:32.639
knowledge of the Torah and the the answer to that question is the evidence shows it's somehow it happen sometime in

02:03:32.639 --> 02:03:38.239
the third to second century BC period you just can't find evidence

02:03:38.239 --> 02:03:44.760
and any other any other claim like when Dan says all like all like

02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:50.360
confident we Scholars all think that it happened in the 700s why not 1300 BC

02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:57.719
then what's the difference because your evidence is exactly the same there's no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] difference between 700 and 900

02:03:57.719 --> 02:04:05.239
950 1370 I don't you're just making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up why why 700s and it's all it is weird

02:04:05.239 --> 02:04:12.639
and like he I know he's a Mormon it is odd that in in the Mormon uh tradition

02:04:12.639 --> 02:04:19.000
there's a prophet one of the prophets I think it's nii or whatever KN high or Lehi I don't even know I have no I don't

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.520
not study that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at all it's totally off my radar I have no idea what I'm talking about so I'm just going to give

02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:30.760
a little warning I have no idea what I'm saying but I do know I do know that that that Prophet supposedly lived in the

02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:36.239
700s in Egypt so it makes sense why someone would want to say that Moses had

02:04:36.239 --> 02:04:42.960
to have been around in the 700s because my Prophet needs to hear about Moses or else the whole thing blows up right so I

02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:48.920
there's a theological reason why he wants to push him in the 700s no notice how he threw in that

02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:54.719
little and maybe 800s why did you say that what made you say that like what

02:04:54.719 --> 02:05:00.960
what what happened in your brain that made you say maybe 800s is there some sort of evidence in the 800s that we can

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:08.480
look at no you just said that randomly yeah just so odd you know you know what

02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:14.559
that is that's that's that funny burning feeling you get in your Nethers when

02:05:14.559 --> 02:05:21.719
you're in the back alley and you're like that little touch that he haded maybe a little bit early you just look you um

02:05:21.719 --> 02:05:26.920
you could have said that for 500 years either way either way of your mark and

02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:33.559
with the same Assurance you know what I mean and that's why when he said about the Christ thing he said

02:05:33.559 --> 02:05:39.119
Preposterous um that is the act of

02:05:39.119 --> 02:05:45.199
the it's not a it's not cowardice it's it's um

02:05:45.199 --> 02:05:51.360
projecting a confidence that will float your point right you're not you you

02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:56.520
don't care about evidence the guy that you interviewed that dude is obviously

02:05:56.520 --> 02:06:06.800
built his career on evidence and handling evidence yeah I got need look at Lehi

02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:15.920
from the book of Morman he lived 600 so 7th Century BC so think about it he needs Moses to

02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:21.880
be around in the 700s or the 7th Century BC for this to work if Moses is not

02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:27.760
around before Lehi mormonism's dead dead in the water gone does not it's

02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:33.400
impossible for this random guy in living in Jerusalem to to be one of the few

02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:39.639
people who who knows who Moses is you know what I mean so that's that's all

02:06:39.639 --> 02:06:47.480
I'm just saying like the guy need he claims to be a descendant of Joseph so just making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up like

02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:54.440
what's the difference between this and saying I don't know the Torah existed 900 BC why not they're both the same

02:06:54.440 --> 02:07:00.159
claim they both have no evidence right just right baseless claims it's all what

02:07:00.159 --> 02:07:06.840
it's all it is and you can get away with it right because this is what you do as

02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:13.960
a monest religion you have to re-educate people into a history that you've

02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:22.400
crafted that's what monism does is it tries to hijack Culture by splitting spitting the

02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:30.679
timeline into another you're in another mental world where you think this is your history imagine how many Jewish

02:07:30.679 --> 02:07:37.520
people in across the planet imagine how they would have to

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:45.239
come to grips I mean what what would the thinking be what if I just found out I thought my culture was Ancient Ancient

02:07:45.239 --> 02:07:50.360
Ancient was the Bedrock and foundation of the 10 commandments and and now I

02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:57.639
find out a bunch of Greeks were moving through moving through this part of the Mediterranean and bumped up against the

02:07:57.639 --> 02:08:06.880
Phoenicians there right by the way for those of you who like Phan how much literature was left behind not much so

02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:12.119
you know what mother Greek killed you too right um but by the way another

02:08:12.119 --> 02:08:18.800
another another claim that's made too is they'll they so some of the stuff that they find in these older Babylonian

02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:26.159
myths that make their way into the into the Old Testament they use that as

02:08:26.159 --> 02:08:33.320
sort of like a a way to like Leverage oh it's really old because it's got these texts but those texts those very same

02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:39.679
texts are also cited by Greeks living in the helenistic era so those texts can

02:08:39.679 --> 02:08:44.719
that that argument is dead because those texts are still around in the same time

02:08:44.719 --> 02:08:51.760
periods that we're talking about so it doesn't you can't that doesn't make it older those texts are older but the

02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:57.840
texts are still around in later times and people are still people still don't know how to read and write in cative

02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:04.559
form up until this I think 100 AD is when when C form dies finally so people

02:09:04.559 --> 02:09:11.159
are people still knew there was one of the scribes of Alexander the Great using K form say today King Alexander has died

02:09:11.159 --> 02:09:17.239
we have that so that's another nonsense thing the other one they'll point to is like there's a character this is what

02:09:17.239 --> 02:09:25.559
Kip was saying to me and this is a good point Kip made there's a character from The Bible B son of peor the prophet and they found

02:09:25.559 --> 02:09:32.280
they actually did find a text inscribed in a wall where this guy's mentioned and it's in a it's in some sort of building

02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:37.480
that existed probably in the seventh sixth Century BC something like that

02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:43.639
now that's to me is is interesting because okay now we have a prophet who's

02:09:43.639 --> 02:09:50.000
mentioned in older text that makes his way into the older into a newer text but that would be like saying Homer should

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:57.159
be dated to 1350 BC because agamemnon's in the story Agamemnon is a Meenan King

02:09:57.159 --> 02:10:04.599
who place in history at the time of the Trojan War which is way back in the Bronze Age so characters existing later

02:10:04.599 --> 02:10:11.520
in attacks later it's it's it's if there's if there if there was more of that going on I would be more convinced

02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:17.040
but just having one guy one or two guys to point to no I can't it's it's just

02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:23.239
it's just not enough for me you know I saw I saw that you were looking into the

02:10:23.239 --> 02:10:31.320
medical text there and wandering through and I wanted to ask you why is

02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:37.840
it that we have medical tax from Egypt we have medical tax from Rome and we

02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:44.119
have medical TXS from Greece and Greece has by far the most

02:10:44.119 --> 02:10:51.800
right the most advanced stuff right the Sanskrit Sanskrit has some medical text too real real medical why is is it that

02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:59.920
we don't have any oskan umbrian or Hebrew medical text very same

02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:05.719
reason people think that Hebrew was actually spoken when Jesus Christ was

02:11:05.719 --> 02:11:13.840
walking around they were like Shalom Jesus he was like Shalom right no they didn't have Hebrew

02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:19.960
they didn't have Aramaic they had Greek and people say oh the the apostles that

02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:26.239
wrote the you know the gospels and whatnot that those people were

02:11:26.239 --> 02:11:34.199
originally they speak Hebrew they they when they go home from their lunch break right they they speak Hebrew that's a

02:11:34.199 --> 02:11:39.800
that's a joke that's a joke those are all native speakers I'm telling you 35

02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:46.520
years of reading Greek I'm telling you those are all native speakers your

02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:52.679
little theory about there being Hebrew there is a giant joke but it's part it's

02:11:52.679 --> 02:11:58.880
not funny because it's meant to alter that historical timeline so that people

02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:05.199
in the future will think oh this was the past no it wasn't as Neil showed tonight

02:12:05.199 --> 02:12:11.840
the stuff didn't even show up until the second bro right which makes sense do

02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:17.960
you understand what the powder the powder that you just uncovered this is

02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:24.440
real powder this is the good stuff because Jesus is not that

02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:33.360
far then from the very origin of Judaism from the very earliest monest Jewish

02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:40.159
cult Jesus is only a Century Century half away that's amazing that's that's

02:12:40.159 --> 02:12:46.440
absolutely amazing yeah um some of the Greek texts that I'm reading some of the translations that I'm reading you know

02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:52.880
from like from uh lb um uh for example

02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:59.159
um what's polius and CST they site Punic texts

02:12:59.159 --> 02:13:04.599
that are lost but so the Punic had a writing culture the pho Punic is just

02:13:04.599 --> 02:13:11.599
another word for Phoenician it's like Latin word for Phoenician um the Punic the carthaginians and the Phoenicians

02:13:11.599 --> 02:13:17.199
they did have a writing culture and they did write like philosophical uh medical and they wrote

02:13:17.199 --> 02:13:26.159
agricultural stuff but we'd lost it all the only the only only way we have it is from people like pus and Salis citing it

02:13:26.159 --> 02:13:31.840
so they write about people like Mago is one of these one of these um carthaginian writers um there's a couple

02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:38.480
other ones and they they they so they did have like somewhat of a of a

02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:44.000
literate culture going on in the seafaring Phoenician world but you're

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.840
right in Hebrew you it's like a black hole of there's no garans you don't have

02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:55.719
you have garans in Latin you have garans in Greek you have garans in in Sanskrit

02:13:55.719 --> 02:14:01.679
like there's a they're very literate these are very literate cultures writing about writing writing about letters

02:14:01.679 --> 02:14:09.199
writing about writing about writing like but you can't find something like that all we have is biblical

02:14:09.199 --> 02:14:16.320
text and then then when you get to density Scrolls that's when you find like oh you know uh laws for the

02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:23.559
community that's it you find stuff like that and then and then and then there there's a big black hole and then you go

02:14:23.559 --> 02:14:30.239
all the way back to ugarit so in between ugarit and the Old Testament there's like a big black hole where all you get

02:14:30.239 --> 02:14:35.719
is inscriptions but you also have

02:14:35.719 --> 02:14:43.159
elephantine and Al everybody well you know elephantine it's Aramaic no they're Jews they call themselves judeans they

02:14:43.159 --> 02:14:49.000
that fled the Wrath of the Assyrians and so there you do have you we do have some

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:55.360
stuff but all of it points to not knowing who Moses is not knowing who Abraham is and being a part of the

02:14:55.360 --> 02:15:01.719
regular Mediterranean world like everyone else I like I like how you said it um

02:15:01.719 --> 02:15:07.599
you just brought it all together and said look this is the Mediterranean baby and they're just developing it's not

02:15:07.599 --> 02:15:16.000
that there aren't cultural Jews right ethnic Jews but they aren't practicing

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:24.239
Judaism yeah they're not they're not they're not separating themselves off from the rest of the world like like people think they do yeah and that's

02:15:24.239 --> 02:15:31.040
that's a beautiful thing to know yeah it is should and I know I know a lot of

02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:38.559
people that I interacted with in Israel and by the way your guest I think was involved in the dig at tell megido right

02:15:38.559 --> 02:15:44.040
so yes yes that that's really cool that's that's heads up I salute

02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:51.400
right ran into in the 90s when were you there yeah 91 I was there in 991

02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:57.040
yeah he probably was there I bet he probably didn't remember me because I was just a dirt mover you know what I

02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:03.520
mean so but I'll tell him I could tell him he'll remember if if uh um because

02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:10.880
of the floor because of the temple floor that our group found he'll remember I'll tell him I was with them um love it love

02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:20.119
it I want to ask you though as you peel back as you peel back this layer you're G to be dealing now with Scholars of the

02:16:20.119 --> 02:16:27.040
Bible who are going to have that mindset that oh the prophet Isaiah this is Iron Age

02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:34.518
this is this time Kingdom of David Kingdom of this and that for which there's nothing right what are you gonna

02:16:34.519 --> 02:16:41.359
do um in order to push that knowledge forward like if you're a part of the museum and you're trying to push it

02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:47.638
Forward what do you do you just do do you just make documentaries and ex and just kind of try to expose the real

02:16:47.639 --> 02:16:53.558
history what do you do that's what I said I got so I'm last time I was on this channel was probably over a month

02:16:53.559 --> 02:16:58.760
ago and I said that in the next couple days I was dropping that video and responding to some of the stuff that

02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:05.518
happened in the Dan and Danny video and I didn't lie about that that video's been done for over for like weeks and

02:17:05.519 --> 02:17:11.678
weeks and weeks but the reason why I haven't dropped it yet is because I wanted to drop this video first because

02:17:11.679 --> 02:17:16.880
I use some of the clips for the video do that make sense so you're going to see

02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:23.760
when I drop the video on my response to some of the stuff that Dan m was saying on Danny show which I thought was just a

02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:29.840
a complete um [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show be honest like

02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:35.920
he's he first of all the Lucian thing was kind of crazy not knowing Lucian it's like that's the main source for

02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:42.080
Assyrian for Syrian religion of the and the like um the what is that what do

02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:49.000
that text call a Syrian goddess that's that's lucian's work like and that and that's like one of the biggest texts

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:54.840
that people go to for for Arabian and Syrian religion of the lant because

02:17:54.840 --> 02:18:00.000
that's like they all we have other than inscriptions and archology so you can't

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:05.439
you can't be an expert in religions and not know Lucian you have to know Lucian that was like whoa and then then he's

02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:10.920
being being shown he's being shown um the hararia and any Roman religion

02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:17.598
expert knows all about hararia this isn't some like back alley random thing that you find in one text hararia is all

02:18:17.599 --> 02:18:24.678
over the place and he when he's being shown the hararia his face he goes like this he does he does that he goes huh

02:18:24.679 --> 02:18:31.558
like he's never seen it before and this is like Read Mary Beard's book Roman religion which if by the way how does he

02:18:31.559 --> 02:18:38.719
not know this Ro everyone anyone who studies Ro ancient religion you got to know Mary Beard's book at least at least

02:18:38.719 --> 02:18:44.478
it's one of those it's one of those introduction books you you you agree with me on that it's one of those introduction books that you have to have

02:18:44.479 --> 02:18:49.598
yeah yeah no I used to teach I used to teach the course uh classical religion

02:18:49.599 --> 02:18:56.319
and I used her textbook I totally disagree with her on some things but TT

02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:01.719
and I agree with you on that but here's the thing though she talks about the hararia and Compares it to Easter just

02:19:01.719 --> 02:19:07.399
like we you and I do because it's so it's just like why wouldn't you there's so many

02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:13.080
parallels and she stays out of her Lane she doesn't she doesn't study Hebrew Bible in New Testament so she doesn't

02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:20.359
make conclusions and says one's copying the other all she's doing is pointing out whoa look at this Hilaria Festival

02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:26.678
well they celebrate a a death and resurrection of a god cool that's it she just gives you the facts then you do

02:19:26.679 --> 02:19:32.800
what you want with it but but Dan when he's being showed this information he tilts his head and

02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:38.840
goes huh that's not right dude how do you not know about the Hilaria and and

02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:44.000
to not know about the Hilaria is a big deal because you make it your business

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:51.080
to refute anybody who um tries to argue about you know paganism influencing CHR

02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:57.720
Christianity which I which I get that there's a lot of a lot of really bad information online a lot of people who

02:19:57.720 --> 02:20:03.000
just are like making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up about Horus having 12 disciples and being crucified

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:08.399
that didn't happen in the sources but at the end of the day there are some legitimate parallels and there are

02:20:08.399 --> 02:20:14.920
legitimate sources that people do need to know about because it's it's fascinating stuff and he's he's out

02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:22.479
there like putting his foot down saying there's nothing here dying and Rising gods don't exist is all made up nonsense

02:20:22.479 --> 02:20:29.080
anybody who talks about this is doesn't know and it's like if you don't even know what Harari is then why are you even talking about James Frasier because

02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:34.240
that's like half of James Fraser's book Hilaria is all that's like a not half of

02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:40.000
his book but that's like 10% of his book has to do with Addis and the Hilaria so

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:45.280
it's like how do you not know if you you don't know Hilaria then why are you even talking about James Frasier because you

02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:50.880
obviously never read James Frasier you just now you're just making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up at this point so you'll see I got I'm

02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:57.520
getting all fired up about it but I I got some stuff to say I got some stuff to say look at how fired up you get

02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:04.720
everybody in satanic congregation that's fired up right for those sources because you're just protecting those sources I

02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:12.200
totally I love that I love that um I want to ask you one last question that's

02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:19.040
pressing um I want to know once you bring this to people their

02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:26.080
response is going to be because it's always been um something's wrong with you right the reason I was going to tell

02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:32.880
you the reason the people still think the Old Testament or the Torah was

02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:41.200
originally written in Hebrew is only because of that first and first BC and

02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:47.920
first ad culture that was coming up that was creating that monest propaganda

02:21:47.920 --> 02:21:54.840
right if the text is as old as the thir Century it means all

02:21:54.840 --> 02:22:03.040
of those claims about the land and about who it belongs to all all of those are

02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:08.880
created those are not those are not historical actualities that's the

02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:14.319
creation and of the third or second century yeah and you don't even know how

02:22:14.319 --> 02:22:21.040
right you are because if you we're looking at this it's just a historical thing Israel

02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:28.760
existed at the time of Nebuchadnezzar and we know this because Nebuchadnezzar brags about taking over Israel they get

02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:35.240
stomped out they lose their Kingdom and then they're subject to whoever's in power whether it be the Assyrians the

02:22:35.240 --> 02:22:42.520
Babylonians the Persians the Greeks the solids the tmes and they're just kind of waiting there it's not until the Hasan

02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:47.600
period as we mentioned after the maban Revolt where Israel finally gets their

02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:54.280
own State back around 164 DC so it makes sense like you said there's no like they

02:22:54.280 --> 02:23:00.720
don't own anything they're just people that live there they don't own anything and then like then they they do end up

02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:07.600
getting their state at that time but like literally less than a century later they're being sacked by pompy already

02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:16.120
done lose they lose the RO they're are they don't they won't even hold it for a hundred years 63 BCE the meaan Revolt

02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:22.800
was in 164 so that's 100 years but but even for so like it's the you're right

02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:30.040
the point you're making about who owns what that's such a muddy waters gray area cuz there really is no ownership

02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:36.880
over anything it's just people that live there you know what I mean getting they're all getting sacked right by the

02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:44.359
big powers in the area right it's all of that movement of of of uh Power harod

02:23:44.359 --> 02:23:50.720
the great Herod the Great is making deals with the Romans saying we'll be your client State you know we we'll we

02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:56.880
we'll watch your borders for you just make sure you take care of us and send us send us some send us the the needs

02:23:56.880 --> 02:24:04.200
that we need like you know send US troops so we need it and that's what happened it's almost like in like America today how we support Israel

02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:11.399
that's how the Romans were for Israel for a while yeah until Nero and then Nero changed that and then but then they

02:24:11.399 --> 02:24:17.240
went back they went back to to doing what they were doing again back to ENT State and then hadrien had some things

02:24:17.240 --> 02:24:22.479
to say but that that that was the end of it after Hadrian they never went back until

02:24:22.479 --> 02:24:29.600
1948 so you can count you can literally count less than a I don't I don't even

02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:36.560
know I want I'm not going to say it right now but it's not there's they don't have the land for thousands of years that's not a thing right no no no

02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:43.200
or and the archaeological the archaeological remains ex uh expose that

02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:48.600
right that they don't they would have way more of these settlements that they would find way more of the cities where

02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:54.160
we even I was at the what called the Palace of Ahab right and it was like

02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:59.319
dude is that all they found right there is there was there no other habitation

02:24:59.319 --> 02:25:05.479
here so um a lot that that theological drive to say oh it must be the Palace of

02:25:05.479 --> 02:25:11.560
Ahab during the kingdom of so and so is just an attempt to fit on that biblical

02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:18.720
narrative now if we push the biblical narrative all the way down to the third and 2nd centuries and we say look this

02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:24.760
stuff is coming from Greek it's not that coming from Hebrew they're back translating it into Hebrew to try to

02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:31.560
create a tradition for themselves and they're doing it out in the middle of nowhere right why are those people with

02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:36.640
the Dead Sea Scrolls the ones that have both the Greek and then the Hebrew back

02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:43.640
translation why do they have why are they out in the middle of the desert where are all the libraries in Jerusalem

02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:50.920
and people will say well there aren't any how about the libraries how about the libraries in of Asher Bonny people

02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:57.200
say oh look we have this great NVA we have this great library of so and so and

02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:03.080
they open it you look at the stuff that's in that Neil it's garbage you're

02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:08.439
not finding epics and scientific documents and here's the government and

02:26:08.439 --> 02:26:18.840
History Section you're not finding that you're finding laundry lists of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that late Lugal is a gayy emperor of

02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:27.279
everything taken you get mythology you get Kings list you get law codes kind of what you get and

02:26:27.279 --> 02:26:34.520
you're right in a lot of a lot of like a lot of ostria which are just like little notes like hey meet me meet me in six

02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:41.800
months in this place like why don't you get philosophy why don't you get philosophy out of

02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:47.319
it that's that's a good question I think philosophy is a product of Persian

02:26:47.319 --> 02:26:53.560
period uh especially in the Middle East I mean obviously there's not I mean on philosophy depending on how we Define it

02:26:53.560 --> 02:27:01.479
but like strict philosophical thinking that's a Persian period idea I think I think you I think

02:27:01.479 --> 02:27:09.359
your presocratic so predate those Persians give me the name besides Oh no

02:27:09.359 --> 02:27:15.560
you're right some of those PR critics were around during the Assyrians when the Assyrians are sacking Judea there's

02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:20.720
Greek presocratic writing stuff already at that in the 600 don't

02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:27.040
thees um even even even Sappo yeah Sappo is alive before the Persians were in

02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:33.880
power Sappo was alive during the neo-babylonian Empire also not getting any lyric right

02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:40.439
those Greeks do predate a lot of these big swings in history yeah the the Greeks are making those even the lyric

02:27:40.439 --> 02:27:46.399
poetry this is such a good point this is such a good point that you're making because people there's a myth that Greek

02:27:46.399 --> 02:27:51.560
influence starts with Alexander the Great before that there's no Greek influence

02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:58.840
that's wrong Greek influence starts way before that as we mentioned the Athenian coins the coins of with Zeus on it

02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:05.560
Greeks Greeks have a lot of influence and they're very cultural people people like their people like the Minoans and

02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:12.479
the means and they're adopting the way they dress and the purple and all that purple die from monans um a lot of the

02:28:12.479 --> 02:28:18.640
culture does come from the Greeks even even if it's Myan Greeks monan Greeks or

02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:25.359
even even hittite who are um you know very closely related through their

02:28:25.359 --> 02:28:31.000
palasan ancestry we'll say right and they're using the same alphabet and the lydians are writing uh and they

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:37.840
basically is very Greek close to Greek lydian I think I think lydian's considered a Greek right no I'm not sure

02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:43.319
about that to be honest usually you can you can see ly and Roots very obviously

02:28:43.319 --> 02:28:52.000
I don't know to what degree it's the I it's the cousin of the ionian aric up against yeah it's like

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:57.720
it's like lydian and Greek is like Aramaic and Hebrew they're very close they have a lot of the same vocabulary

02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:04.279
maybe a little bit different grammar but like you like they they worship the same gods lydians are worshiping Aphrodite

02:29:04.279 --> 02:29:10.560
they're worshiping uh Artemis they're worshiping Apollo and Zeus and they're writing in the same like so it's the

02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:15.760
same cultural cultural it's same I think the Hittites are like that too well hang

02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:21.560
on hang on though let me ask you this question so you do see it on the Greek side you see oh this is a lydian route

02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:30.200
but here's the question um how come there aren't any lydian Texs left why don't we have lydian I will I will I up

02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:35.960
you on that the lydians invented minted coins they credit the idea of having a

02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:41.200
minted coin yeah with a face on it or like that's lydian lydians

02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:48.800
have I bet you they use the Greek language to do so I bet did it's the Greek alphabet you find

02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:56.880
all you see how the Greek language just absorbed it's such a superior machine

02:29:56.880 --> 02:30:04.200
right that people like Marcus aelius were like you know I'm going to use it and when I write philosophical documents

02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:11.560
I'm going to use the Greek because it's capable it's capable of doing that it's not a it's not a race thing the funny

02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:18.640
thing is this is what this is what really shocks me life is not about your race has nothing to do with your race

02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:26.479
it's totally incident it's about your language because history shows that the

02:30:26.479 --> 02:30:34.279
more powerful the language the more the spread and with that spread of that language comes more technical knowledge

02:30:34.279 --> 02:30:40.160
comes more development right you get philosophy only when you have a language

02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:45.760
that can convey the philosophy and uh I love it I I want to

02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:50.880
make love to Mother Greek that's what I want look at this real quick I just want to pull this up real quick last thing

02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:58.479
because it talks about cus and and there this shows you how close lydians and Greeks are it says um corus's credit is

02:30:58.479 --> 02:31:04.279
issuing the first true gold coins with the standard circulation uh blah blah blah blah blah

02:31:04.279 --> 02:31:09.600
but look at this he claims descent from the original agbon who conquered Troy so

02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:17.040
they're read they know they're like list they're reading Homer all all the way in in Asia Minor like Greek Greek influence

02:31:17.040 --> 02:31:22.880
is everywhere you know what I mean yeah and it is a Greek song remember Homer's

02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:28.720
a Greek song Right I'd love it man I love it

02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:33.800
that's that's absolutely gorgeous um Neil thank you for coming tonight I want

02:32:08.319 --> 02:32:14.120
like your demon possessed I can feel it I can feel them doing it right now that's the kind of stuff they're gonna

02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:07.040
doing and I thank satanic congregation I think everybody that watches initiating

02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:13.560
apocalypse and all the little bits that I do I think those people all appreciate that I don't mean to speak for everybody

02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:19.279
but you know what I mean I think they really appreciate that and that's why you do such a great job you're going to

02:33:19.279 --> 02:33:25.680
go out some great interviews coming up and stuff like that too so there

02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:32.840
too you're documentary that I've been working on for a long time now that's gonna come out after the after the Dan

02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:38.319
response video is g to be a video about the about the Dark Ages comparing

02:33:38.319 --> 02:33:43.399
comparing the Dark Ages to The Classical period And I I I already recorded most

02:33:43.399 --> 02:33:50.120
of it that's that's on its way too make sure and get those really skinny

02:33:50.120 --> 02:33:56.160
I found an article from this douchy Bible scholar nerd I don't even know if he has a PHD I don't think he does I

02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:04.080
think he has like a master or something I think he like failed out or something but he's one he's one of these like Bible scholar type of people you know

02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:10.560
he's he calls himself the history for atheist he has a whole article about how the Dark Ages is such a bad term you

02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:17.319
shouldn't use it because it was actually really good Christians were actually really cool right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm gonna

02:34:17.319 --> 02:34:23.359
show with evidence that that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's that the Dark Ages even though that's a that's a that's a term that's

02:34:23.359 --> 02:34:31.319
obviously subjective in itself but if we Define it by literature

02:34:31.319 --> 02:34:36.920
which is what pret petrarch and um and uh who are those guys that talked about

02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:44.120
the Dark Ages petrarch is the guy he coined the term you know you know the those Renaissance guys who use that term

02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:51.200
Dark Ages um they were they were using that term for l literature they weren't

02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:59.600
talking about the economy they weren't talking about armies they weren't talking about logistics they're talking about literature text and if you you if

02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:06.760
you take the definition the way petrarch you wanted the definition to be used he's absolutely right that it was dark

02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:14.600
ages the texts are trash some someone know someone said to me one time they go what about

02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:22.680
bolf B wolf that's all you can come up with from from 500 B ad till uh

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:28.399
1300 you got Beowolf you're gonna compare that to Homer are you kidding

02:35:28.399 --> 02:35:33.760
me can you tell me one character from bolf I don't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about bolf nobody

02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:42.840
does not a household nobody's talking about Bol it's such it's such just you're just

02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:49.760
trying to find something what about K Arthur okay fine there's one I don't know I've read I've read

02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:57.600
some of that King Arthur stuff in the medieval Latin and it's terrible it's absolutely terrible so no I don't get

02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:06.680
that not stack up to Ides and Homer safo and um pend pend P come on we can

02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:14.000
go on for days yeah the list goes on there's no there's no comparison you got

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:20.720
not till the Renaissance when people start writing good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] again you got the L Series for the for you to be able

02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:26.640
to peruse through digitally were you surprised at how many Greek authors are in

02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:32.479
it oh yeah it's crazy we I mean but you know

02:36:32.479 --> 02:36:38.080
what else surprises me is how much we don't have and how much because you you and I both know because we read we both

02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:44.960
read a lot of primary sources because we just love to do it they site a lot those Greeks were citing stuff like you don't

02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:50.960
get a lot of citations in like the Hebrew Bible no one's citing anything but these Greeks haritas he's mentioning

02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:56.000
other historians before him and he's mentioning the names of their books and

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:02.479
other people will even mention those same names and books and you can make a list of hundreds maybe a thousand people

02:37:02.479 --> 02:37:08.600
who are cited who we lost oh yeah just in Galen just in Galen

02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:14.160
alone because he is always siding older Physicians he and he loves to site

02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:20.160
helenistic Physicians and most of them are names that we don't who the hell is that

02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:27.319
right and there's dozens upon dozens upon dozens of citations that he makes I

02:37:27.319 --> 02:37:34.920
mean it's uncountable so all of that literature that we don't have that survived because some Monk in the Dark

02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:42.319
Ages wiped his buttocks with it yeah you know that oh God exactly they stopped

02:37:42.319 --> 02:37:49.600
preserving the the good beautiful amazing text yeah of the polytheistic

02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:56.200
world that's full of color and three-dimensional and everyone has different ways of looking at the world to this onedimensional

02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:04.200
dark cold just no life it's just lack lacking

02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:11.040
life that's what it feels like and they're all wri about the same topics oh uh uh Maximus the Confessor wrote

02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:16.600
another Treatise on the Trinity oh how God and Father are one and the same and

02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:23.880
how dare you question that how dare you your mind and think well how can one person be the same as another

02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:30.680
one and that's all you get you get nonstop treatises on the Trinity for 500

02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:37.600
years great and Beowolf imagine Neil imagine living in

02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:45.479
