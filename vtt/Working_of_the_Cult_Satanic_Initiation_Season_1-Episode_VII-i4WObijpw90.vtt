00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.500

um we're gonna meet him for the first time yes fantastic and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.939
we will be looking at some questions we have a real special thing tonight I'm

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:35.340
gonna press ahead with the translation of the formula of the the cup the cup

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.260
whose cup the Christ cup

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:56.520
[Music]

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:05.880
so people were telling me they were especially interested in um kind of Plumbing the depths of the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.939
hardcore pharmacology they want to know about this cult operation they want to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.840
know what it's doing people tell me they liked the presentation that was my

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.600
translation of Revelation 17 yes using the orphic terms

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.880
so it's a translation for those with ears to hear using Otto currents Vox

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.460
orphica yes so people like that so I'm going to bring you something very

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.579
similar tonight to meet your tastes and it's time for us to meet the Antichrist

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.340
what I'm going to do is go ahead and put the text up we've all seen the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.119
andromedas text this is neroes this is by way of reminder this is Nero's

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:05.100
Arch doctor Arch physician and he is in the midst of bringing uh this formula

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.440
back this hymn yes this cult ritual

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.660
Nero wants this stuff yes so we're going to look at the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.300
beginning of the translation starting and ending at the same point the Christ

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.640
and the Antichrist and I want you to realize that I'm choosing my words very

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:35.099
carefully because the Christ and Antichrist are the doubt and antidote within the

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:43.319
mystery so when Jesus is saying um that he is that

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:51.379
he is not pulling it out of thin air where does it come from where does this term come from I tell everybody

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:57.660
no room for guessing here we don't want any sort of ideas or general theories or

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.900
you know we're not here to develop Sarah you know

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.319
um yeah uh we're here to bring you the evidence so let's look at the evidence

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.360
from this preserved in this narrow to see what they're doing at the time and

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.120
what the Cults are like so I just flashed the Greek up you up to you I'm going to read

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.459
the translation that I call

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.180
the goddess called calm from the communion of vipers

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.540
and I am using the title that is given with the text so here is the text itself

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.760
I want to read you from the Christ to the Antichrist and of course realize

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.560
that this Christ what is Christ at its basis just realistically and rationally and and uh

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.560
uh actuality what is the actuality of Christ is the one who has been stung by

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.099
the gadfly Creo in its oldest form means the one who's stung by the gadfly the

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.140
one what's that word for cat fights oysters right the one who has the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:18.600
oysters right you and I would say estrus yeah the one who has that there is an

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.180
antidote of calming that we call Galena

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.240
that just means the calm sea waves the calm storm

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:38.160
the idea is you you think of the immediate time post storm when it's silent and the waves are flat

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.400
it's that time it's the Galena you know uh half these people are on

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.000
ships and are into trading so you can't you can't fault them for the terminology

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.759
and to know that gives us a a clue about what the words

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:02.520
actually mean how to translate them so we're learning a lot of context here as we go

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:10.199
oh lovely the goddess called calm

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:16.740
from the communion of vipers hear me Caesar

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.440
and no the compounded Antichrist

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.780
Giver of unconquerable freedom

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:38.660
hear me Nero her name is Hilaria Delaney good goddess

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.220
Hilaria Galena good goddess

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:53.720
no for a fact that she does not shun the Dark Harbor

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:02.039
she has no concern for danger when someone has over measured the hated

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:11.600
opium and place their greedy lips over Gloom inducing wine cup

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:22.319
nor does she who calms the storm turn away from the Mortal whose cup is full

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:28.020
of aconite hemlock

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.918
or the communion of chilling nightshade

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:41.539
she fails not to come as Antichrist to the yellow die

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:49.440
of Medea's communion the so-called bringer of sorry bringer

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.780
of premature death

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.880
she comes to assist the use of the blistering beetle

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:06.900
who pushes the blood she comes to the initiate struck with

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:13.440
the Viper Venom of Echidna Darkness bringer

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:21.240
nor does calm lose her composure in the presence of the horned serpent

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:31.440
the pain inducer Galena pacifies the dry Viperine thirst

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.599
bringer the Venom of the Scorpion

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:43.380
is not protected from her not even the ASP herself

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:50.220
the communion that possesses the Venom of the most powerful necromancers

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:56.699
nor does Galena bend the knee to the feared Oak die

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:03.660
nor with her present does the initiate remain unto the influence of the death

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:09.960
state nor does the open bleeder

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:16.080
when overcome with one of their bloodletting potions despair

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.379
never when good goddess is present

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:28.560
with Galena the hated venomous spiders are unable to injure a man

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.680
she puts off the Shivering burden of pains

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:40.500
nor does Rock navigating Hydra the sea snake burn

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:46.440
the first ruler of and panther of the warm salt sea

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:53.760
meeting the amphibious snake would not bring the limits of Sweet Life

00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.600
the lips of Syrian women sprinkled with death

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:08.420
the one relying on Galena rejoices in the moist flowers of Summer

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:14.279
oh Caesar whoever walks the Libyan Seashore cares

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:19.680
not for the danger nor does the serpent who goes forward

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.800
and backward bring Doom and neither does the toad that pastures

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:32.000
on the dry plane with her with Delaney

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.640
one would easily find the cure for a bloated stomach and heal the short

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.660
pointed Point uh the short panting asthma whenever the spirit within rolls around

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:52.860
the stomach swelling with pregnancy and forces the bitter pain of birth

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:59.100
when the guts swell in an unpleasant whirling when someone should have an

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.860
inflammation of the sting of the beautiful gadfly

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:11.040
she's there to help when the entire frame of flesh is bilious

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.860
standing out with prominence I'm going to stop there

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:22.800
so that we can catch up uh with what is going on this is the

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:29.459
beginning of the hymn and what we are doing is we are hemming the Antichrist

00:10:29.459 --> 00:10:34.800
we are Hemming the concoction

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:41.519
that we will consume yeah or that will be administered to us

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:48.959
I should say is technically because sometimes they're putting it in the eyes right so that's not consumption and

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:54.320
certainly um off the rectum is not consumption but this is that compound

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:00.779
derived from the cup they have this special word for those of

00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:07.380
you who didn't pick it out there's a special word in ancient Greek that you saw from my translation

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.480
that is the drug that it um causes the death state

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:19.380
so they actually think about that for a minute they actually are sitting around and have developed a drug that compound

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:26.279
that they can administer and put somebody into a death state

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:33.720
yeah yeah so um a couple of things I want to point out

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:42.480
um we're talking about that Antichrist and her name is given in three different ways Hilaria

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:49.320
yeah Hilaria Galena yes good goddess

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.420
Hilaria Galena good goddess and those of you who know

00:11:54.420 --> 00:12:00.180
um about Roman Greek religion will talk about the Hilaria and what it is

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.339
um yeah so these are not um these these are native Greek terms

00:12:05.339 --> 00:12:12.180
this is strongly ethnically Greek this is it has great cult for a core

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:19.440
Center um the language makes that clear

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.899
these little couplets that are the Poetry are written in a way

00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:30.000
that betrays a familiarity with the form

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.820
of hymns produced in what we call the orphic hymns

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:43.200
so yes yes yes and it will have more hops lagomina words that are only found

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:50.880
in one place then any other text besides hesitius in order to understand the

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:56.760
vocabulary of this very special hymn that we're reading this Antichrist in

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:04.200
order to understand it we have to go to the ancient lexicographers like the victorians did

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:10.560
and we have to say what does hezekius say about this really really rare word

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:17.279
right because you know we can't Define it if we see it just once you look you can't the only way is to go back and say

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:24.120
well what are the anti-lexicographers saying hopefully they said something about it and about its roots

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:31.800
um and uh and yes guess what they do so a lot of this is there in this text you

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.540
are getting the most verified

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:43.079
mystery cult you're getting the rarified air of it with these I mean you are

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:49.320
hearing the hymn you're listening to the invocations you

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:57.180
are feeling the formulas it's coming out so I just want to make a couple of comments about that they stand out this

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:04.560
portion of Medea this communion of Medea that we taught this medic

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:10.019
communion um

00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:15.839
is from a vessel it's pictured as being from a vessel

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:24.959
right so from a the Mead or the medwa or the Medea is that

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:31.980
cup she is the one who brings that communion to you

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:37.920
now if you are in a mystery right if you're one

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:46.339
of the initiated you have shaved your head you have entered into the morning

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:54.959
and you've done all the fasting and all the you know the particular drug regimen you're supposed to be doing right

00:14:54.959 --> 00:15:00.839
depending on wherever the locality was where wherever it was you know the

00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:06.000
plants that are used there in those locations okay so um yeah notice by the

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.860
way too the wonderful variety of plants that we're dealing with that the Galena is the galani is a remember the glanay

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:22.320
is an antidote right and so he is the galani is actually going to be used for the person

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.600
who is put into that death state if you don't have the Galena on board you're

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:33.660
not coming out you're not coming out of the death state that's all part of the death and

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:41.399
Resurrection cult that we are in right we're opening you up bringing you

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:47.880
into the reality so that you may be born again the way you don't see it but the

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:54.660
way is embedded in this poem yeah it's embedded

00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:03.120
the way fantastic so there's a couple of points I want to make um the potion is the cup and that cup is

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:09.060
that cup of cornea that we're using right it's coming from her Dark Harbor

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:15.240
and remember that Dark Harbor the word for Harbor there is the word for vagina

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:22.500
yes yes the flowers that are in and when I say

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:29.579
yeah the flowers that are there that we pictured um those flowers are the vagina

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:35.639
right the victorians even knew that and wrote it down right that's where we we

00:16:35.639 --> 00:16:41.459
get our our knowledge of it right wait a minute this is uh this is the word that they're using for

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:47.459
um the labia yes right exactly so so it's it's join

00:16:47.459 --> 00:16:53.579
there the pornea is part of it um remember Jehovah is a misogynist

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:58.680
extraordinaire right there's a reason that we have to

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:05.579
kick out that lady Babylon right yeah there's a reason

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:13.199
it um she works she is the cup that brings us the communion

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:21.720
yes and with the combination of the Cross of her Christ and her Antichrist

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:28.438
you can perform this right which will enable you to wake up to the reality you

00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:36.419
go somewhere and you'll come back you'll be horrified you'll be amazed you'll be stupefied life-changing you know you you

00:17:36.419 --> 00:17:45.480
quit your drinking um you know you swear off you're gambling you know right right and you

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:51.720
begin to live a life of the way right right

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:57.840
yes the life of the way it's embedded in the Greek that I just read you

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:04.020
it's embedded in that Greek I want to make a couple of points with our last 10 minutes here

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:09.120
um I want I want you to notice that um and by the way the Dark Harbor is

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.120
associated with specific divinities specific Divinity so we have to be

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:21.539
careful there right um look at what they're using opium okay

00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:28.380
nobody's surprised they're using opium there's Virgil tells us how to grow opium you know um so opium opium it's

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:34.260
everywhere they're mixing it and everything right so where do you think they get their concepts of stupor from

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:40.380
right there's this state that you can enter into when you're you know chasing

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:46.260
the dragon if you will uh you enter a state of

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:53.700
yes um why one Victorian defined it as a sullen a state of being sullen

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:59.039
um yes perhaps that was his opinion he probably was chasing the dragon though

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:05.640
so maybe he knows anyway um we have opium and we have uh the oh

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:10.919
and notice that he said the Opium is over the wine cup right because you what

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:18.419
do you do is you take little lozenges of goodies and you dissolve those in your wine right and you get like a you know

00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:24.840
you get a a cough a Palma uh what they would call in the Middle Ages a potion

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:32.580
right yes lovely you see the reality it's it's gorgeous it's gorgeous um she fails Not

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:38.700
to Come As Antichrist to the yellow dye so for those of you who are talking about the dies

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:44.520
the dies um I think Dion was talking about the dies and somebody sent in

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:52.080
um the manuscripts for uh the uh papyri on the dye making you know

00:19:52.080 --> 00:20:00.419
the dye making and what you know we're looking at whether or not this those dyes were psychotropic well they're

00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:05.520
using them not only to dye things with but get this right the world is not what

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:13.200
you think don't impress your world on it right these Dyers are the ones that were getting the

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:19.380
religious cult through you say what yes why do you think there

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:24.780
are Baptists right right back to baptize something is to

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:32.100
diet yes so they're making these and apparently there is one that they use in

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:39.720
in uh uh in the performance of according to this in the performances at da dona

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:47.580
which is one of the great you know people will argue it's the oldest Greek oracle you know it's it's the prophecy

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:52.679
of Zeus how is Zeus able to prophesy with this cup

00:20:52.679 --> 00:21:00.960
the Oracle become she who knows what is what was and what will be did you ever

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.980
wonder why they were talking walking around talking about the Christ being that one

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:12.780
yes now you understand the Alpha and the Omega right

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:18.240
that's the that's the power of the Christ

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.280
yeah the oyster Mania

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:30.419
um yeah and there and Jehovah is always an enemy of that feminine produced

00:21:30.419 --> 00:21:36.659
Source you can you can step out and say this God has an issue

00:21:36.659 --> 00:21:43.799
with the production of this right and what it means I'm sure

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:50.280
because we know the Jewish civil um um exists because somebody stood up and

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.740
said look at all this misogyny right what is all this misogyny doing

00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.840
right good for the Jewish civil good for her it was one of them they stood up you

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:06.900
know it was somebody at dinner one night and they were like wait a minute they were looking around they're like wait a minute I'm in a world

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:12.299
that is controlled by a force that hates women

00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:19.559
that truly has a problem with women yeah and all of a sudden we're back in birth did you notice the hymn comes back

00:22:19.559 --> 00:22:25.260
to the birth right with that fetus

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:32.400
yeah gorgeous we're gonna burn off our immortality here right we have to have

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.620
the Antichrist to do that we have to

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:43.260
um yeah a couple more points I want to say um uh she comes to assist the use of

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:49.080
blister beetle so you're getting some more drugs that are involved that she is balancing

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:54.480
um and they know that the blister beetle pushes the blood they know what happens what causes erection they're not the

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.640
their uh doctors is not that in the in the dark

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:06.960
um yeah the Viper Venom of Echidna Darkness bringer now we're getting into some specific types of drugs there are

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:15.299
some other echidni who are using the this thing that puts you Into Darkness

00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:21.480
um like a mist yeah there was a Mist over his eyes

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:28.799
yes now you know right he's just getting rid of his demons he's exercising his

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:35.520
demons right sabotic purification yeah fantastic stuff

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:41.760
um gilani pacifies the dry Viperine um thirst bringer that's the dip sass

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:48.240
right snake the one that brings the thirst and I want to ask you did you notice how many

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.280
serpents were involved here did you notice how many different Venoms and did

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.679
you notice it's um within balancing the doubt and the antidote that they're

00:23:58.679 --> 00:24:06.840
they're revealing their own cult um he says look there are these these goes these old necromancers

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:15.960
by that that are involved in this drug that is um the asp the ASP which their

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:21.179
ASP it looks like you know it's a take it for what it is identification

00:24:21.179 --> 00:24:28.020
wise but it has been identified traditionally as the Egyptian cobra it's

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:35.400
the Egyptian cobra so apparently he says the most Undisputed magicians

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:41.220
right they are using the Egyptian cobra

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:49.380
yeah and Galena is so strong she neutralizes even that

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:54.960
yeah this is amazing if we could trace back the genetics because remember it's a

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:02.240
woman who is producing this stuff right you thought the purple trade was

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:08.159
psychedelic and expensive yeah imagine this and now you know why people are

00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:14.700
sailing around trying to kidnap her right and there's a line of them and

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:21.299
heronitus heronsis opens up with their kidnappings and the oracles

00:25:21.299 --> 00:25:26.880
this is everything this is the foundation this is the

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:34.740
foundation of the western world yeah and it's Christ and Antichrist it is

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:42.120
dote and antidote these are drugs drugs of communion produced by the human

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:49.620
body let me just make a couple last points um we talked about venomous spiders and the

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:57.720
Scorpion they're using those the very famous Greek god was able to urinate those now ejaculate

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:03.720
yeah minus right what ejaculated yeah

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:10.320
the Venom of the Scorpion and this um one of the snakes

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:18.539
actually I think it was snake's plural yeah a combo a polo pharmacon that you can only get

00:26:18.539 --> 00:26:23.760
from his ejaculation right and it's so bad that he was

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.799
killing the women that he was having intercourse with

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:37.140
isn't that something ejaculating so if you're stuck in the fairy tale you

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:42.960
know like when they say Biblical history or Bible times whenever somebody says

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:49.020
Bible times you realize that's fairy tale world right so if you want to understand what

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:56.340
they're actually doing with these with these drugs look at um look at it from a very basic level right

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:03.000
uh and the the religious drugs allow you to do that right because they're putting somebody into a death State and bringing

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
them out of it right for a reason so they can be born again right you can have the vision rip open

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.659
the reality right um gilani rejoices in the moist flowers of summertime and

00:27:15.659 --> 00:27:23.039
um in that place the word specifically points to vaginas right and uh so again

00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:28.140
the cop because we're talking about the Poma the meatic Poma the meatic thing

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:34.320
that we um is our communion is our communion

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.840
um yeah and then we get to the birth ending off with the oysters right they

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:46.200
call Beautiful they call Beautiful why because they're using the oysters in the in the birthing

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:52.679
process it's an EOS it's a it's a poison that

00:27:52.679 --> 00:27:58.799
um uh numbs pain and facilitates birth

00:27:58.799 --> 00:28:04.440
and that's why you get kicked out of the garden you s you disgusting women that

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:11.640
ju I'm speaking like Jehovah right that's why you have to leave the garden it wasn't because

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:18.840
um um it wasn't because uh um you would uh you know you wouldn't be

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:24.539
able to find a better place a condo somewhere maybe with a piece of strip land it wasn't

00:28:24.539 --> 00:28:31.200
because of that it was because you would lose access to the drug that allowed you to enter

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:36.600
into that painless state of birth um which people say is that Nashville is

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:43.740
that natural yeah because what was there was from what was in the garden those were the drugs that she was using

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:48.840
in order to do that um you know this is fantastic I want to

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:55.860
I want to transition and talk to um Darren here for just a second

00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:01.880
um about he said something earlier today hey Darren it's good to see you

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:07.679
you said something earlier today and I know this is not your expertise but

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:13.860
you're just reaching out there and you're getting information you know we're looking for scythians

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:19.320
um in armor you know what I mean we're uh we're looking for some kind of warrior not necessarily heavy armor but

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:26.220
something you'd wear on a horse you know and you could be comfortable in while you're collecting your herbs and I'm

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:32.220
looking for a six foot I'm looking for a 12 year old six foot 12-ish 13 somewhere

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:37.919
in the chorus stage um yeah and I hear that they these may

00:29:37.919 --> 00:29:45.419
be out there um you feel pretty good about that um yeah I feel pretty good about that so um

00:29:45.419 --> 00:29:51.120
there's a couple articles I'll post them in Discord again but I had already posted them but they found in um

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:56.820
northern or well Northern Mongolia Southern Russia tuva region they found

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:04.260
remains of a scythian woman 13 years old decked out in Amazonian gear and very

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:09.440
large so I think you know we have our evidence there

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:16.799
fantastic fantastic now you you have been uh working on the Discord a lot and

00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:22.380
you say you're Fielding a lot of questions and you've given me several topics to talk about is there anything

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:27.419
in general that people seem to be really interested in that I may be able to

00:30:27.419 --> 00:30:33.000
address no promises but maybe so right now two of the big fields that

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:41.340
are really interesting is uh I was we've been going down this rabbit hole about the African connection in um Libya and

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:46.440
in North Africa specifically Dion has been bringing up the tareg people who

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:54.120
have a blue indigo dye they raise snakes and they uh you know they also uh you

00:30:54.120 --> 00:31:00.659
they're doing a bunch of these kind of rituals so we're wondering if maybe there's a connection here to uh lady

00:31:00.659 --> 00:31:06.419
Babylon in in that whole thing yeah I think the best connection there

00:31:06.419 --> 00:31:12.360
is um the fact that Libya you know is not only the home

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:18.299
Center of this great Oracle you know um but I mean that's why you go in

00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:24.960
Antiquity to Libya right you're going to the Oracle of Ammon right and and so um

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:30.539
is there an association Olivia with the drugs yes particularly with the the

00:31:30.539 --> 00:31:36.720
serpents are crazy right um so yeah and the drugs and there's this famous drug it doesn't grow anymore

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:44.419
that nobody can find anymore that supposed to be really good for you um right yeah um

00:31:44.419 --> 00:31:51.899
yeah so um uh and who do we know immigrated from Libya through Egypt and

00:31:51.899 --> 00:31:59.340
up to into Georgia um to be with uh you know the scythians that she became such a such a proponent

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:06.120
of their culture and um yeah yeah I think it's all it's coming through Libya

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:11.520
isn't it that's where this lamia is from right that's where the Athena is from

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.000
right so um the men erwa the Minerva yeah I love

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.299
it man it what else what else is out there the other big thing where we've been all been searching for is this

00:32:24.299 --> 00:32:31.200
snake woman the Virgin blinded snake woman that you've been referencing and I know that wretch has been looking into

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.960
this with the Mellow scene and then I've been looking into this on the Indian side and I found connection with this

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.000
goddess Manasseh and uh yeah I think we're finding this figure so I want you

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.880
to elaborate more what is the purpose of the the the Virgin snake woman and what is this connection here

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:57.059
yeah and why did Jung get his dirty little hands on on on her as well yeah

00:32:57.059 --> 00:33:02.159
he had to he couldn't miss her she's all over the place right even Herodotus in

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:08.000
491 and somebody may have posted that on the Discord um but um

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.159
heronitis talks about her right and who is this who is this person who is the

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:20.940
half virgin half uh Viper um half serpent right and I think what

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:28.320
um you know Hercules is doing his thing you know spreading his spreading his worship

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:33.539
and his cult and his you know doing his Arrow things he's got his Arrow toxins

00:33:33.539 --> 00:33:39.960
from the from the uh Centaur that he was you know ultimately kills the guy but

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:46.500
um from the Centaur um that was teaching him and he's spreading that knowledge right and he's

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:52.620
Associated indirectly with Medea he tries to go on a mission to help her but

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:58.140
um instead the it wasn't the helper it was the kidnapper but instead his little

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:03.480
boy gets lost he has a young boy with him and everybody's like oh okay this is

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:09.300
those Greeks you know this this is the way of the of antique no it's not

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:16.138
there's a very specific reason he has a boy with them and that he's involved in a boy cult right get your head out of

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:23.700
the story and get it down to the actuality about why they're writing about these things right so um he's he's

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:29.580
going around with his cult and now I've come a little bit of a field of what the

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:35.040
question was help refocus me yeah we're just trying to find this

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:43.020
snake virgin right yeah yeah who is this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] snake virgin snake

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:49.080
virgin he does find the snake virgin right and he finds her in a cave

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:54.240
yeah he finds her in a cave right so this is heronitus

00:34:54.240 --> 00:35:00.060
this is odd we know that Hercules or Heracles was all over the place right we

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:06.000
have shrines to him all over the place he's a big deal he's one of the fathers of a different

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.260
um uh peoples in Greece right and spread all through the Mediterranean as far as the as far as Spain

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:20.040
so um yeah so um he he meets up with her right and um

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:26.880
notice that whenever he gets to the oracle he's always killing the one who

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:32.579
guards her yeah he's always killing the one who guards the trees

00:35:32.579 --> 00:35:39.180
right where in which is the fruit yeah you see it's the same machine over

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:45.300
and over the the girl who was half Viper half girl is merely the one who is

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:52.619
preserving that song she is the Oracle she is that one who can come strangle

00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:58.920
you right as the Sphinx she can come strangle you I wish people could see that we could bring back the

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:06.180
image of her on the horse with the hair and the poison and the arrows that can

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:11.460
turn you to Stone you can wake up you can just be some kid on a farm and you

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:18.240
can you can get Hunted and wake up in a sexual right

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:24.060
that involves the burning off of your flesh you can be made into the dragon

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:29.640
you can be blinded in the process these are actual things

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:35.099
that are going on this is not fairy tale World they did not sit around the grease

00:36:35.099 --> 00:36:41.880
did not sit around and say hmm I wonder how I can create an interesting story

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:49.140
from beginning to end no they took all everything they've been hearing passed down verbally about the great Heracles

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:55.380
and while he stopped here in this place and he did this he stole these cattle and then something happened he had to go

00:36:55.380 --> 00:37:00.440
here and he killed the he killed the oracle's guardian you know hydra's dead

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:05.820
oh man right so anyway what else do we have

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:12.359
going on one thing I wanted to talk about in address I kept getting all these questions surrounding the uh the

00:37:12.359 --> 00:37:17.400
resource the literature that we all assembled and I think some people are coming in late or they missed some of

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:23.820
things but I want us to address what we're searching for as we dig through all of this later literature that

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:29.280
seemingly passed the Greek era you know like I want us to talk about the orphic

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:35.540
Vox and what is connecting you know Lord Byron and um this uh

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:41.640
you know occaccio and all of these characters and all this different literature that you've recommended us

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:48.240
and what are people actually searching for like what is what is the point of going to these places and finding this

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:54.119
orphic Vox here yeah yeah uh excellent excellent what's

00:37:54.119 --> 00:38:00.180
the purpose of all of that right um first when you build a city the very

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:05.940
first thing you must do is build a temple to the muses it's the very first

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:13.200
thing that AI if you will as you and I were talking about earlier that AI can

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:19.800
only come when that is accumulated that real intelligence

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:26.460
right behind the artificial intelligence that real intelligence is a Quantum

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:33.500
phenomenon so in order for you in order for you to

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:40.440
create a society um when I'm not just talking about a city or government United States or this

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:49.440
government in order for you to create a society you must purify the area

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:56.940
for the news she has to be present and I think that's that's what each of

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:02.700
these sources that you're looking at that's what they are all following

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:10.140
that's why they have ears to hear and it's why guys like Byron can use orphic

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:17.280
images right as if they were a native speaker as if they were a native listener that

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:23.160
they could hear these terms when Jesus walks around saying this is only for those with ears to hear

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:31.020
right you could be talking to a hundred people and there's two or three in the crowd who are in

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:36.119
and he can address those two and everybody else can be like huh what'd he

00:39:36.119 --> 00:39:44.160
say what what right and people explain it modern day pastors explain it by

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:50.660
saying oh this is a way he's using an example he's like this great teacher in Parables no no you don't understand

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:57.119
when you are creating um words sentences ideas thoughts when you're

00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:04.380
expressing logo that have a double meaning where you only were only one a

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:12.540
receiver can receive that you're not giving it to the kitties you're not like this is not Sunday morning Bible study

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:18.440
right this is this is seclusion this is excluding

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:26.520
not including that's what the ears to hear does it excludes those

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:33.000
um who are not initiated who do not have life they can't breathe there you know if you if

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:40.320
you wanted I could have given you so much right yeah amazing yeah beautiful now you're

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:46.800
going to appear you're going to appear uh uh coming up on the Gnostic informant

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:53.640
so I just want people to um uh to support you and that and to

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:58.680
support um uh uh yeah to support

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:06.540
one who has had his demon cast out we have to be

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:12.240
um if we're able to purify and we're able to cast out somebody's devil

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:17.579
right we're able to cast them out of that person then that person deserves to

00:41:17.579 --> 00:41:24.720
be um to have the chance to shave their head into mourning and be

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:31.619
with us and walk the way right um so yeah um Gnostic informant will

00:41:31.619 --> 00:41:38.339
also be honoring um honoring uh Dr Carl Ruck

00:41:38.339 --> 00:41:44.940
and he would like to talk about um censorship and difficulties within

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:52.079
Academia um because he knows as as he told me which I don't think that he would have a

00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:58.140
problem with me sharing with you that um he realizes that those forces that were

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:05.700
he was he had absorbed and was channeling that are contrary to what the

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:10.740
initiation is what the satanic initiation is he knows that those forces

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:16.579
were um were exercised and he knows that those are what

00:42:16.579 --> 00:42:22.440
bring us to a place where we block out

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:31.380
um we block it we we accept ultimately uh the lie that is around us right when

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:38.760
we embrace it so um Darren will be a gnostic informant I will be on second

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:46.700
form with Dr Carl Rock and we will do so embracing embracing the bakic

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:54.480
