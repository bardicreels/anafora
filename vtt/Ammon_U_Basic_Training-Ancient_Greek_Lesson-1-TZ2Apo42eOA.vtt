polacos look now I want I wanted to introduce you to Greek before I give you the drill sergeant because I want you to

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:13.079
see the Greeks have a word for somebody who knows a lot about drugs in an

00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:19.760
intimate kind of way given to the use of drugs look who's the author there Galen

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:27.519
gal that's number two right gal that's gayen that's a medical text do you know

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:34.600
when the head of my committee told me the Romans in with reference to recreational drugs the Romans just

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.839
wouldn't do such a thing it was texts like this that I thought have you never

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:47.760
read have you not cracked these Works open oh my God I'm sorry gets me gets me

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:54.160
all going um look at look at number three you have countries yeah abounding

00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.160
and healing or poisonous herbs and what country is that toia t

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.279
do you know who those people are they're what we call the

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:10.560
atrans what are the atrans known for and you're not going to see this you go all

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.800
the way to Italy today you can get in taxi and cross your fingers and hold on

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.079
and you can get to that atran site right from Rome you just drive there boom

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:28.160
you're there and at that atrasan site you will never know that the people who

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:34.399
were there we're known for all their drugs we're known for their drugs do you

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:42.199
know how many words in Greek there are for altered mental state my God my God

00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:50.120
the atrans it makes sense because the atrans were buddies with the

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:57.279
pans yeah so it only makes sense we know those pans everywhere they go They're

00:12:57.279 --> 00:13:02.480
spreading the drug cult the earliest one is on Samo

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:08.839
rce right we talked about it you and I are tracking the Cults baby we're going

00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:14.920
this is not nobody is bringing this do you know why because nobody works with

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:22.800
these texts and what I find so beautiful is that you are going to give me an

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:29.760
opportunity to give you access to those same texts

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.560
so that you can have your eyes opened so that you can see what it was you didn't

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:41.079
know the atrans are there you may walk into one of their tombs and see all the goofy stuff and say oh God these people

00:13:41.079 --> 00:13:47.720
were high right you may do that but you won't you won't know how accurate you

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:53.000

little right is a little Scott Oxford lexicon he was the father please

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:51.560
Wonderland yeah the Alice from Alice in Wonderland her um father was working on

00:14:51.560 --> 00:15:00.560
putting together what I'm flashing up in front of you and his student was Charles

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:07.759
Dodson and Chuck changed his name to Lewis

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:13.199
Carroll oh wait a minute were there dragons in those days I think there were

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:18.839
dragons here we go um what does this word diamond mean it's a it's a um Power

00:15:18.839 --> 00:15:24.880
or a capacity demon it's our word for demon somebody asked me what is a God

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.759
okay we'll start with demon what is a demon or a Dion a DI is a power and one

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:35.959
of its definition is that of daon it's the same thing it's something that is

00:15:35.959 --> 00:15:42.279
knowing so you can have a d and that is somebody skilled in battle

00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:48.920
skilled in fighting right it means skilled or knowing those demons what are they

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:55.639
they're known now you're gonna stop what I want you to do is stop all your preconceived notions of demons I'm just

00:15:55.639 --> 00:16:03.920
going to lay it out for you what the reality was that never exist existed unfortunately most of what you

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:12.160
know is an unreality the attainment of Greek is the

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:18.399
reconnection with the real and it brings Renaissance and so that's why I'm happy

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:24.040
and and privileged to have um such a great audience my God there's almost a

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:33.040
thousand of you how much honor do we owe these people how much honor look at this people daon what's a daon what's knowing

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.160
or experienced right somebody who is knowing or experienced in something next

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:44.720
one next one boom it's from the verb da now this is

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:51.399
what they said in Antiquity that this verb this term Dion this noun Dion was

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:57.759
derived from the verb like many many the overwhelming majority of ancient Greek

00:16:57.759 --> 00:17:03.639
words they're Dr D from the verb and I want you to think about that

00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:09.880
I want you to think about that the difference between a verb and a noun um

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:15.000
that's the diad that they've got in grammar you mean they're talking about

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.520
diets and monats and grammar yeah you know why

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:28.438
logos logos the Reckoning oh the computation oh God

00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:35.840
that's getting excited learn right right to learn da what is Da to learn right or to learn

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.840
isn't to teach give me the next one I'm Gonna Learn you something you know what I mean watch this though

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:47.720
Dio is also a potential for candidate for this root that this word is from and

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:56.880
it means to burn up or to consume to consume the seeds of fire what she

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:03.440
possesses uhhuh B ISM by fire does anybody understand that expression nope

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:10.640
you don't you haven't seen the real one I'll show it to you are you ready here to burn up give me the next one oh God

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:18.280
what is the diamon I'm burning I'm knowing what am I this is the other thing look it's

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:25.440
hon hon and what does that mean it means to be eager to be eager for something

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:31.400
and they they show you the Brit the victorians they said look it equals Dion for

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:37.000
daon right okay okay I'm starting to get it I'm starting to feel the diamon um

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.440
that blood at the bottom I'm gonna have to put that out that old word haa

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:51.520
originally means blood and or seman blood and or seman so what that

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:59.039
has to do with an eag or knowledge it's going to have to be something that you stew upon

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:05.159
yes then you can stand on the sand with the Beast do you understand then you can

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:52.200
um Hebrew um writings that were the translation of the original Greek

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:59.360
writings called the sepagan and it is laughably if anybody is denying me

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.520
uh uh is is saying no no no this man is lunatic I've got the hardest core

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:10.799
evidence just to show you the fact that the Greek is aiming for and achieving a

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:17.360
much higher level of technical expertise and the Hebrew is a very simple very low

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:24.120
vocabulary very third grade um reading um so but that's the best that you can

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:31.080

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:30.600
million it's off the chart so this is what I can bring to you

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:39.240
take your brain and shut it off because it's functioning in a world of 100,000

00:27:39.399 --> 00:27:45.840
words the big deal is you will be able to

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:53.240
create logos you and there's the magic but you're not

00:27:53.240 --> 00:28:00.480

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:19.159
something you're going to get real familiar with letters there's 24 plus

00:28:19.159 --> 00:28:24.360
one invisible one I want you to learn and I know you've never used an

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:33.080
invisible letter did you know you could use invisible letters with your words wow it explains a lot it explains

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:54.159
ah second letter beta B look at those look at the curvaceous

00:28:54.159 --> 00:29:01.120
forms on that beta whatever it takes for you to memorize this alphabet I want you to do it and guess what pronunciation

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:06.159
we're using guess what pronunciation we're using we're using that which I was

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:12.159
taught in the United States west of the Mississippi River in the

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:17.360
20th that's what we're using we're not going to use the

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.039
original because the original Greek was accented via

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:28.760
tone right oh God had a pitch accent to it and what are you going to do we don't

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:34.720
have that right we are stress accent speakers we are Marching In a single

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:40.760
line the Greeks are not let me blow your brain are you ready for this

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:46.159
verbs have one type of accent nouns have

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:51.279
another yeah nouns attempt to

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:57.840
retain where their accent is when the end of the word changes they attempt to keep the same spot they want to hold the

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:04.039
same same spot verbs they don't care they adjust they're the machines of the

00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:11.679
language that adjust and you're G to start using them that way you mean I thought I just open my mouth and just

00:30:11.679 --> 00:30:18.518
stuff run out yes you do because you're raised under the slavery of

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:27.360
English people are always asking me how is it in ancient Greek you can read six lines and not get to the main verb until

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:33.039
the end you in other words you can't solve what's going on until you have

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:39.919
seen the end right think about this for a minute ancient Greek I'm not talking

00:30:39.919 --> 00:30:45.799
modern Greek that stuff they found in Northern turkey that's a descendant a

00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:53.640
close descendant of uh coin Greek helenistic Greek right modern Greek is a

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.760
and it's not related to Modern Greek it's very foreign to Modern Greek so uh

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:06.000
what is the modern Greek it doesn't matter I don't want to offend the we can put the anglosaxon speakers and the we

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.720
can put the French and the Kel tongue we can put all those things in the one

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:19.880
giant container because none of them historically reached what the Greek did

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:25.880
okay let's get into give me that next letter gamma gamma look at that what I

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:33.639
what am I giving you people I'm giving you the capital letter on the left and um the tiny one on the right right

00:31:33.639 --> 00:31:41.360
lowercase right and what are you going to do look at those shapes again look it's two strokes left and down right and

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:47.679
down it's two little strokes gorgeous give me the next one Delta look at the

00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:59.360
Delta people look at the Delta I want you to memorize this Delta look it's got a tail to it oh God sexy letters Epsilon

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:04.440
Epsilon all right pretty straightforward ready for the next one

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:09.960
zeta wait what yeah yeah now I'm gonna let you say

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:16.240
Zeta and we're g to pronounce it with a zed right but you got to realize this is

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:25.679
a combination of two letters right D and S right oh God look at this one next one

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:30.919
Ada I kind of have a thing for Ada right look at the way look at the way that

00:32:30.919 --> 00:32:38.320
lowercase a I mean it looks like an H when it's big right but look at the lower case oh God you're gonna love that

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:45.880
it's got a little it's got like a leg sticking out seriously let me show you my leg give me the Theta Theta look at

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:51.000
Theta pretty straightforward people and and this font is pretty Universal this

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.039
is this is uh yeah this is a good font um Iota keep going Kappa look at the Kappa

00:32:58.039 --> 00:33:04.159
notice that the Kappa in the lowercase looks like kind of an X when you're looking at

00:33:04.159 --> 00:33:10.679
it it kind of look like an X it's not it's a Kappa c c you love that next one

00:33:10.679 --> 00:33:17.399
Lambda L look at Lambda Lambda you say wait a minute I see people with that on

00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:25.159
their Shield that's because you're watching a bunch of laconians give me the Mew look at the

00:33:25.159 --> 00:33:31.000
Mew oh oh again curvaceous that's caliginous that me is caligus

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.679
give me the new look it looks like a v in English yes the new which makes an n

00:33:38.679 --> 00:33:48.360
Sound looks like a V that may be confusing at first but it'll wear off look at the next letter C

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:54.440
oh oh this one look at that look at the capital and by the way you know you're

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.480
asking yourself what is difference in these styles look at this letter C this

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:06.320
is the letter c which is a Kappa and a sigma next to each other you you you say

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:12.158
this all the time right the cat licks my

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:19.240
cheek licks right well they just made a letter out of it right and looking on

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:24.358
the left you see that Capital look it's just three bars I can see through that

00:34:24.359 --> 00:34:31.638
it's a long bar followed by a short bar and underneath that's another long bar now why do you think that difference is

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:39.560
because those what we're calling lowercase letters those are things that monks make up right those are things

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:45.760
that people who want to write make up on parchment on some kind

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:52.320
of parchment give me a skin you know people are writing things on skins there's a lot of skins there's no books

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:58.960
there's no books there's Scrolls there's Scrolls and buildings full of Scrolls called libraries and shh don't tell

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:04.920
anyone the Christians will burn them all down if you want to check on that go ahead and check on that gayen was

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:10.599
complaining about the other day gayen was complaining but be quiet shh look at

00:35:10.599 --> 00:35:16.839
the C the left side is for stone the right side is for

00:35:16.839 --> 00:35:24.880
parchment oh isn't that amazing you didn't know there was a different element in those uppercase and lowercase

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:30.079

say pie if you say Pi for this I'm gonna I'm gonna virtually punch you in the

00:35:42.119 --> 00:35:49.240
mouth yes right you psychically did that what what happened

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:55.599
don't say Pi Pi is for nerds who study Physics right oh God and maybe some

00:35:55.599 --> 00:36:03.560
geometry maybe some geometry but this is p p give me the next one row and you say

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:08.599
wait a minute I thought that one was a p it was a p this is a row but that's an

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:13.960
English P that's because Anglo Saxons speak with rocks in their mouths give me

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:21.240
the next one Sigma oh God look at this Sigma when it's big it can be that kind

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:27.319
of you know kind of grabby looking and when it's small look when it's that

00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:34.560
first Sigma um of the lowercase you use that internally okay internally in a word in

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:41.079
the middle of a word you use that right we're starting out but if you're going to end a word in a sigma you got to use

00:36:41.079 --> 00:36:50.560
the one that looks like an S it's kind of looks like a snake thing right yeah good how about tow tow oh God a little

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.920
bit curvaceousness a little bit just get a little flirty but you know go oops

oos Osos notice the accent is that little

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:10.880
slash above the Omron second to last letter the only thing you're going to do

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:18.160
with that accent is you're going to stress it you're gonna spend twice as much time on it are you ready the proper

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:28.160
pronunciation is Os Os it's not OS and it's not Kos and

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:35.800
it's not OS it's OS you're putting a little extra time on

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:40.960
that syllable where the stress accent is here's another one next letter behind

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:47.480

00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:12.880
from it right again I'm sorry it's just Superior um we didn't borrow any ancient

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:20.680
Persian there's a reason for that right right you mean the Greeks were right there they could have right um

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:26.160
functionality it turns out just like in nature it's survival of the fittest with

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:34.800

next one philosophia look at that fee that starts out this word philosophia

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:51.520
now I had one instructor from Arizona tell me this is really an aspirated P so

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:57.200
it should be pronounced philosophia right but 99% of the classes

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:02.480

00:48:54.799 --> 00:49:01.640
seriously no we'll just steal it from them because what do they do what did anglo-saxon

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:07.040

immortality that is the source you mean there's drugs that give immortality yes

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:52.880
salvation comes through drugs people there's 1200 of you thank you for your

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:59.680

only I can't because the contract doesn't last it's broken the minute you

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:13.760
make something from it the minute you prostitute it it loses its value the

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:19.760
minute you're doing it to keep your job it loses its value the devil was like

letter people it's a me mimos you hear that time I hit the accent

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:15.799
mimos not mimos not mimos and not MOS it's

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:21.880
mimos and the Greek wants to Accent itself on one of the last three

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:27.520
syllables the last three syllables you're going to see that's where that hangs around and originally that is

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:35.520
pitch up it's pitch up it's very musical Greek is very musical go boom well

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:40.720
mimetic is to be is to mirror is to mirror good and here's the word

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:45.839
everybody thinks they know but they do not it's logos starts with a Lambda and

what is the logos the logos is your

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:57.799
Reckoning the logos is your Reckoning your calculation

00:52:57.799 --> 00:53:04.880

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:13.319
reckoning a reason give me a

00:53:13.319 --> 00:53:21.640
reason and I've got logos you see another thing you don't know that

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:28.280
you're going to know now is that the quantum

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:36.039
reality is the result of the

00:53:37.599 --> 00:53:42.720
logos wait a minute wait a minute let's

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:49.760
give you some practics right these are the people you're going to sit in the future you're going to sit with people

bring them out of it and they can have experienced something that will guide

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:22.599
them they will have an understanding that is outside of

00:55:22.599 --> 00:55:28.039
time and when you get that understanding that's outside of time you can pass that

00:55:28.039 --> 00:55:35.760
on to other people who don't travel and so they imagine you live in that world

00:59:32.319 --> 00:59:39.200
that we just looked at right Dion It's a verb that is it's an action

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:44.400
or a state of being

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:52.480
Dion I am gonna wake up tomorrow and Dion or maybe after the sun goes down I

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:59.720

00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:09.880
possessed by a diamon by a power by a skill a

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:15.200
knowledge did Socrates say he had a Dione yeah he

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:21.799
did yeah are diones good things yeah they

01:00:21.799 --> 01:00:28.839
are your conception of a Dione is completely off

01:00:28.839 --> 01:00:35.119
completely interesting yeah yeah those Fallen

01:00:35.119 --> 01:00:40.200
Messengers are always the ones to bring you the facts those Fallen

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:46.240
Messengers um so how do we translate this people think about that what am I going to wake up in the morning and

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:52.440
demonize that's how we're going to have to translate that with the word demon taken from that

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:59.400
word this is going to bring us perfectly right keep going got H graph that's any kind of writing graph look at the gamma

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:07.440
up front gamma GG up look at the next one go bibl on BI on

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:12.799
do this mean book does this mean book no because they're not using books it means

01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:20.119
scroll really but it's the concept that you have in your brain when you're thinking about what a book is yeah it's

01:01:20.119 --> 01:01:26.480

starts us off with anthropos anthropos we get anthropology

01:01:31.559 --> 01:01:38.319
in English and it just means human being it just means human being anthropos

01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:43.720

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:37.799
strike every horse in EAS you hear ecstasy in English because

01:03:37.799 --> 01:03:45.160
it's where we stole the concept of ecstasy from he's going to strike the horse he's gonna place the horse in

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:51.400
ecstasy and what else is he gonna do

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:57.720
in he's GNA put the rider of that horse in a St of

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:03.880
paronis what is Parris Give me the definition watch this people the

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:09.359
technicality boom this is the word first word I want you to think about easis

01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:14.599
right from easis this is ecas the dative give me the next

01:04:14.599 --> 01:04:20.160
one paron again the dative what are and I'll

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:25.279
tell you later what those mean that's how the ending of the word is changing don't worry for now all I want you to

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:30.599
see this thing starts with a p and I'm not going to say Pi it's a p

01:04:30.599 --> 01:04:37.960
watch this people what is easis Give me the definition oh my God displacement

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:46.119
like Greek ancient Greek displacement a standing away or outside

01:04:46.119 --> 01:04:55.160
of what is normal number two distraction of Mind distraction of Mind plus a

01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:00.480
little bit of entrancement

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:07.839
entrancement okay do you understand what easis is easis and some preacher was

01:05:07.839 --> 01:05:13.680
stand say this is from this is from the prefix e and

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.039
his yeah shut up watch how the word transforms give me the next one that's

01:05:19.039 --> 01:05:25.839
easis now what is the Hebrew right because this is translated in Hebrew um

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:32.319
into Hebrew what does the Hebrew give us for easis it gives us this

01:05:32.319 --> 01:05:41.400
Tama to be astounded or dumbfounded wait a minute wait a

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:48.119
minute wait a minute easis is not this because there is a

01:05:48.119 --> 01:05:56.520
great concept for this it's tho and if you believe the be s story

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:02.839
that's been handed down to us that this was originally Hebrew and then translated into Greek the Greek

01:06:02.839 --> 01:06:09.520
translator just missed something extremely obvious extremely either the Greek

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.839
translator is terrible or the original Greek was rendered into a much more

01:06:14.839 --> 01:06:21.200
simplistic Hebrew form that couldn't carry the technical capacity in other

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:26.880
words ancient Hebrew got no word for ecstasy

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:32.720
sorry to be astounded or dumbfounded Now give me the other ones what is

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:37.760
paraphrasis what is paraphrasis I need them to see the definition first whoops

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:43.079
no that's not nope up one parron look at

01:06:43.079 --> 01:06:50.079
paron right it's look in the parentheses you see frin frin is that mind right

01:06:50.079 --> 01:06:57.279
what is that wandering from reason paron is to be beside your reason to be

01:06:57.279 --> 01:07:03.319
standing beside like if you could take your reason out of your body and stand

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:08.680
there that's what you're entering into when you are paraphrenic now look at

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:17.240
that I just made an English word that doesn't exist paraphrenic to stand outside

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:22.279
yourself I like that I like that your own wits right what they do in the

01:07:22.279 --> 01:07:29.520
Hebrew with this what they do in the Hebrew with this it's a huge concept the frame is huge what is this to be mad

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:35.000
that's a little simple that's a little simple and off technically because look

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.799
what kind of Madness they're doing again look at how third gr it is madman

01:07:40.799 --> 01:07:47.079
behaving as a Madman demented driven mad it's like clinical Madness it's like

01:07:47.079 --> 01:07:53.279
clinical Madness the only problem is both of those Greek words are associated with

01:07:53.279 --> 01:07:59.319
Mantic powers what romantic Powers the ability you can take it down the ability

01:07:59.319 --> 01:08:06.799
to stand in the ion to stand in the ion to see see

01:08:06.799 --> 01:08:14.240
outside of time okay outside of time give me the next one boom um what is

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:20.400
something that's monos it has that

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:26.798
Mania right that has to do with INSP

01:08:26.799 --> 01:08:34.199
Iration right has to do with inspiration look at the second um uh

01:08:34.199 --> 01:08:40.278
Roman number two frenzy and number two frenzi enthusiastic

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:46.040
inspired right notice it's Aristotle it's PL you know uh it's philosophers

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:53.440
defining right this where we're getting these definitions from right A lot of it you know um and that's the beauty of

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:58.719
Alice's dad and what he did um and look at the bottom just for for

01:08:58.719 --> 01:09:04.238
those of you who never believe me when I tell you that these things have to do

01:09:04.239 --> 01:09:12.440
with drugs look at number three at the bottom cause something can cause Madness stros can cause Madness and we find that

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:20.758
in diores so um notice at the end it's pharmaka Pharma Mani right um the let's
