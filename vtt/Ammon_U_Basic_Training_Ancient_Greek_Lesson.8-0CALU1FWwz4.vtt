00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:06.840
uh giving you something right this is compared to um compared to any sort of

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.479

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:51.760
you these sources and I want you to look at them we are landing what's the target tonight late first century into the

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.279
second anod domy we are picking the time why are we doing that there's a reason

00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:05.600
we're picking the time when the accounts of the New Testament

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.600
are being written being recorded so we're taking a sample of the language

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:17.600
the same language that's being used in the New Testament and I'm going to bring you tonight what am I going to bring you

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:25.839
I'm gonna bring you you knew what I was going to do okay we're going in to an initiation

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:32.800
and I want you people to be respectful to be respectful okay nobody says

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.760
anything nobody jumps out of line I want you to see it through mother Greek it's

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:46.680
gorgeous um let's do some comments first where did those other two go that you brought did you put those up or no no

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:52.040
those other two comments okay you did um this is the second Bible scholar who has

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:58.399
made their field look like a joke I thought he was going to have a legit rebuttal to Almond's claim of the child

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:06.800
trafficker but nope that word just means something different in New Testament Greek it's called Street Greek LOL it's meaning in all

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:12.480
other Greek books doesn't matter yeah exactly so here's one side of the coin

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.680
you see that this is a person who's handling the evidence right and looking

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.600
to the people the detractors to say what what can I do with the evidence they

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.800
don't they never do it's what makes us so strong and them so weak okay now this

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:35.560
is the other side of the coin give me the next one watch this alond hman is not a Biblical scholar and his expertise

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:42.600
does not apply to biblical scholarship you're right my expertise

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.839
doesn't apply to biblical scholarship and I'm glad that it doesn't because

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:54.560
your garbage is so bad that the head of Dallas seminaries Greek program wouldn't

00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:00.040
come on the air to talk to me about what a Christ is

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.760

sense of an eye openening cult that gives you eternal life through a

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:39.559

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:08.680
said don't let the Christians teach that they'll warp it they'll twist it and warp it and turn it into God ofage right

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:13.880
and all the art will get skinny people who are depressed your Society will be

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:19.680
depressed this is just Lucian saying hey um you're right about that man I saw you

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:25.200
from a distance I saw you coming from a distance and boy was I you didn't just

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:31.720
burn me I you turn me into a flaming Inferno and what' you do you put that

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:37.680
invisible fire which I thought was a neat way to describe some kind of uh

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:43.319
magical um process you put some invisible fire it sounds like something

00:37:43.319 --> 00:37:50.240
somebody said me if I put an invisible fire into your eyeballs tell me because that's what he says that she's doing

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:57.599
she's filling them up especially in those little those little private naughty places the splankna remember do

00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:03.560
we have to go back to the thing with Jesus and Mary Magdalene where he's

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:11.839
feeding her his his uh his uh seed after he has um entered into

00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:17.800
self-pleasuring as the text tells us do we have to go back to that place we

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:22.960
don't have to go back to that place um we just went there and just recall it to

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:29.920
mind right look if you don't eat it we're going to die [Laughter]

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:37.520
who who thought take it down for a minute we who thought it was a good idea this dude comes out this dude comes out

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:44.640
and runs a takes this woman out into the back that later she was pardoned hundreds of years later she was pardoned

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:50.800
for possessing sex drugs right he's gonna he's gonna take her up

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.839
onto a hill and what does he do he starts pleasuring himself Jesus why are

00:38:55.839 --> 00:39:03.440
there no paintings of Jesus Christ pleasuring himself because there are stories about it there are stories from

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:08.480
Antiquity about it how come that is that what the Canon was all about I want to

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:14.680
know the Theology of Jesus Christ pleasuring himself and then

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:21.079
eating it I want to know the psychology of that too because it's a little

00:39:21.079 --> 00:39:28.480
unpleasant did you think you would see that you're you're I told you guys we're going to an ancient

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:34.280
right a mystery right okay let's watch them Christ each other are you ready I

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:39.839
don't know if they're ready for this bags on give me the next one boom and uh

00:39:39.839 --> 00:39:46.960
what happens she says um you should remember young guy right

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:54.040
um You can't really um reach manhood like you're

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:59.880
reaching um without demonstrating your skill and

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:08.119
wrestling what do we have here is anybody

00:40:08.119 --> 00:40:14.319
Disturbed is anybody Disturbed okay good good there's a little disturbance there

00:40:14.319 --> 00:40:20.240
okay why is that because you're getting used to the picture that is the original

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:27.040
mystery the I've got a word for all the monks out there you can give me the next one I've got a word for all the monks

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:33.640
out there um um it's not fa boss but it might as

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:41.400
well be keep it there um who is he by the way she describes him as uh um at

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:48.160
least he you know he is one of those aees that would

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:55.000
attract the lady of magic who we know are using their sex drugs all the time

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.319
right sex drugs all over the place and who are they who are they gravitating

00:41:00.319 --> 00:41:06.640
towards they're gravitating towards the AE the one who is arrived at

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:12.560
puberty okay so this is who Lucius is finally we see a description who is he he's an

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:18.920
AE and people who are christing are doing it for the sake of

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:24.400
access to the AES yeah well then you say what about

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:30.440
Jesus Christ he's got all of his AE students right with him that he's taken

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:38.359
from right off their parents' ships right so they could go um fish for

00:41:38.359 --> 00:41:44.839
men right he's taking them right off of that right out of that life put them right into that

00:41:44.839 --> 00:41:52.200
lasti right where the boys are being drugged right all of this is being made

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:59.240
possible through christing because christing makes you

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:05.119
psychotically horny disturbingly

00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:11.400
horny right ever aroused ever aroused do you see what it

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:20.400
brings out you know what you can bring out of people you can bring demons out of them yeah Jesus Christ did it with

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:25.520
Mary seven times you should have seen it was

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:32.280

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:06.039
I'm going to tell you the answer to that question which has never been answered

00:44:06.319 --> 00:44:17.559
before I'm GNA quote it to you from the first century very popular very popular

00:44:17.559 --> 00:44:23.280
ass story yes written by

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:30.280
priests love it love it is this the next one okay look people just so you don't

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:35.599
think that this is um the most you know

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:42.400
that it's my creation this you know when I keep telling everybody look you know the sex and the drugs are all part of

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:51.520
the mystery christing is christing yourself with a sex drug so you can be around boys okay um kitis right you

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:57.960
could be you can do the kitis thing Jesus Christ right okay fine look at the

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:03.599
just so you know it's just not me I want you to look at these at the wonderful

00:45:03.599 --> 00:45:10.559
description they gave in this reader which is gorgeous I for all my students who've been through um the Intensive

00:45:10.559 --> 00:45:15.680
course this you pick up this reader just swamp this website we got to list that

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:23.319
website and everything we'll do it later but um the love making scene of lucious and plra is filled with double on Tandra

00:45:23.319 --> 00:45:29.079
okay involving military and wrestling metaphors the Greeks describe or the

00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:36.720
Greek language loves to describe sexuality in the most Vivid of terms the

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:42.520
most Vivid of terms why look at what Lucian does

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:48.800
postra offers herself as the wrestler and they're going to wrestle

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:54.920
and she tells them exactly how she wants him to wrestle and he

00:45:54.920 --> 00:46:01.920
wrestles and why does he wrestle cuz he really wants her to use the magic he

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.720
wants her to use the magic he wants her to use the

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.160
drugs right and he thinks he's gonna get there he thinks he's gonna get there

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:17.839
this way it's like a sacred path that he's on it's like a sacred

00:46:17.839 --> 00:46:24.079
path a mystery purification now if you're surprised that Jesus Christ was

00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:29.680
performing mystery purifications on a feed I am

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:36.040
sorry but the history is wrapped up in the language bra and it's easy to get it

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:45.359
there's no Theologian I guarantee you there's no Theologian alive who has ever read um Lo's ass to every Theologian out

00:46:45.359 --> 00:46:53.880
there that gets my goat do we have Penelope anywhere that gets my goat it really really gets my

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:59.000
goat the cross must cover the s of

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.079
penelopy do you understand Jesus

00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:12.839
Christ was in it using drugs to interact sexually with

00:47:12.839 --> 00:47:19.599
AES right okay give me the next one let's look at more let's go deeper into

00:47:19.599 --> 00:47:26.640
the S okay boom are you ready here we go here we go

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:34.319
oh do you know what's happening here okay so look she just tells him you got to prove yourself as a wrestler you

00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:41.160
punk okay um so she strips down she strips down naked standing there totally

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:47.920
naked in front of him right and she sets things up she gets herself ready in

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:55.280
front of him and she says hey meon um do we have the next slide I

00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:00.680
think is what a meon or did I not bring that one oh here it

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:07.200
is a boy a lad a stripping he is going to be

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:13.800
stripping but strippling okay we'll say it the strippings the stripping strippling

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:19.079
meon um so that's how she addresses him right it's you know clever give me the

00:48:19.079 --> 00:48:26.960
next one um hey um meon uh take off your clothes and oil up

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:32.359
your part with the myrr uhhuh and you're going to do this

00:48:32.359 --> 00:48:37.800
so that you can embrace your antagonist so you can embrace your

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:43.000
antagonist you know what that is that's wrestling you get oiled up when you

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:51.799
wrestle then after those two have wrestled you take that and you scrape it off of them and you can use that as a

00:48:51.799 --> 00:48:58.720
drug yeah that's what they do that's how advanced this scientific knowledge is

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:07.079
look at it I know it's alien but look at it oh my God are you ready okay now

00:49:07.079 --> 00:49:13.440
here's the everybody this is going to be as scientific as I can possibly make it

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:19.680
and I'm just going to paraphrase um she says I want you to put

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:25.079
me on my back on the bed and I want you to grab my legs and I want you to spread

00:49:25.079 --> 00:49:30.280
them and I want you to rip me apart

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:35.799
okay okay that is the

00:49:35.799 --> 00:49:44.240
translation that is what you have in the company of the

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:53.400
Stripling who is being inducted into the magic right of

00:49:53.559 --> 00:50:00.160
Christ okay and what does she say oh my god um yeah let's go to the next one

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:07.599
let's go to the next one there's some other stuff there some details but it's quite you know it's quite um explicit

00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:13.000
and I want to be as scientifically you know I want to remain as as pure as we

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.640
possibly can right and so what does she say he starts blabbing blah blah blah

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:24.240
right he starts talking during the wrestling and what she say she slaps him

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:30.200
in the face right he's like huh right and she says

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:36.839

causes a little just a tiny bit of nausea tiny bit of nausea but you need

00:51:20.839 --> 00:51:26.880
to see what the Christ is doing you need to see what's going on he says the they

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:34.680

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:52.679
God tell us if you are the Messiah the Son of God now do you feel that we are

01:16:52.679 --> 01:17:01.320
now in a back alley and you are being touched you're being touched by rabbis

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:08.520
from the first second third centuries and you know what they're doing you know what they're doing they're grafting on

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:14.320
their own tradition in order to acquire texts that

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:21.400
are originally Greek to put their own stamp on it they're back translating so you know we have all their jars with all

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:26.560
their Greek sources that they are translating miserably into Hebrew

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:33.960
ancient Hebrew which only has in seven to 8,000 word capacity and what are they jamming

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:40.280
Messiah did you know it's not in the Greek text that is an original Greek text of the New Testament and do you

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:46.159
know it's Christ it is not Messiah it has nothing to do with

01:17:46.159 --> 01:17:51.440
Messiah right that is a lie it is a lie

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:56.679
and historical chunk of of propaganda stuck

01:17:56.679 --> 01:18:04.840
in the time stream causing a slant causing a projection another

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:10.678
timeline to form where we all believe what was

01:18:12.199 --> 01:18:18.040
planted Julian said don't let it happen man you've got to maintain vigilantly

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:23.480
those classical sources so that you know so that you know by the way this story

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:29.400
of Lucian tonight is brought to you by an earlier story of the ass that

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:37.320
everybody is following and why is everybody so interested in this ass why the ass is

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:42.400

me the next one where he confesses what does he confess oh God where is it look at the

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:11.159
very bottom line look at the very bottom line he confesses that the

01:24:11.159 --> 01:24:18.600
to so the crism of the myrr has done what to him it's in the

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:26.320
next has done what what has it done oh there it is right

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:33.719
right it's put him into a position it's put him into a position

01:24:33.719 --> 01:24:39.280
and he's describing oh this is this is a later description I know what I did I took this from later but he first

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:45.159
describes what the crism does and it does for him it puts him into a place

01:24:45.159 --> 01:24:51.080
that he sees he sees that woman slash

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:57.760
Kion he sees her as an agent that attracts

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:04.400
him he sees her as beautiful and how does he do that he does that by means of

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:10.159
the crism by means of the christing do you want to see that remember when you

01:25:10.159 --> 01:25:16.760
go to a temple and the temple Priestess in this Healing Temple is bringing you

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:24.040
to the place of climax under the influence of drugs right I'm not talking just men um

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:30.440
because the women are doing it in groups okay so when you come to the

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:36.760
Pinnacle of that biological act under the influence of their drugs the point

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:43.639
is to bring you healing to bring you healing and when you see that Priestess

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:50.800
Through The Eyes of the drugs she becomes that beauty that absolute Divine

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:57.639
beauty isn't that interesting they're using sexuality and drugs within

01:25:57.639 --> 01:26:04.040
Christian right right this is where Jesus is coming

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:09.840
from okay now you know what a Christ is right I think that was give me that last

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:15.520
one again I just want to remember what was the relevance oh um yeah so what

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:21.920
does he do he turns un asine he eats the rose turns back into human he's got to

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:27.360
explain to people he says this lady servant what did she do she gave me this

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:33.239
Christ thing this magical Christ thing oh

01:26:33.239 --> 01:26:38.840
seriously yeah and he goes on to blame her he goes on to blame her for having

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:45.800
created this transformation in him right um and uh then you know happy ending

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:52.960
he's lost his shell well I want to tell you why that was so prominent a theme

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:59.679
this very very popular popular author talked about that and when you look

01:26:59.679 --> 01:27:06.320
into um the transference of Youth right here's the here's the thinking okay so

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:14.199
now you've got we're we get back on the ship we're going to go back we're going to go back to our time and space and um

01:27:14.199 --> 01:27:19.960
when it gets down to it then when you're looking at that right you have to ask

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:28.040
yourself what is happening what is happening in the people that are participating both the child that is

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:33.440
being indoctrinated drugged and you know I forgot to tell you but these kids

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:39.920
these canido these disciples what do they do they cut off their testicles

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:45.000
right they cut off your testicles you know there's not a there's not a lot

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:52.040
going on down there right um there's not a lot of testicular

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:57.360
development so you were created in for the sake of the mystery your disciples

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:03.520
have to be that proper that proper vessel that proper vessel right remember

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:11.480
Jesus with Mary up in the mountain and he's like look you got to eat this and he he masturbates right in front of her

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:17.360
right um that kind of approach is the same route that you see it's the same

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:22.800
approach you see on um the side of this

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:29.560
asinine cult right it's the same root you see in it she

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:37.639
poyra right is affecting that real very real magic he only has to be transformed

01:28:37.639 --> 01:28:46.520

moods do that's what we're going to start working with so I've got to teach

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:16.080
you the Optive and subjunctive morphology I want you to see the

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:22.960
morphology and we're only going to be talking about two tenses with the Optive and optative and subjunctive excuse me

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:28.159
we're going to be talking talking about the present and the arist why is that

01:33:28.159 --> 01:33:37.080
because when you switch out of the indicative mood the verb just hear it the verb loses its

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:43.199
sense of time and gains a very strong

01:33:43.199 --> 01:33:48.600
aspect aspect and what is the aspect it's whether or not the verb is being

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:55.040
done habitually whether or not it's a simple event whether or not it's an ongoing act

01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:00.880
or whether the perfect aspect is an act that has already been done that is you

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:08.000
are in a state the perfect tense is you are in a state of having done something

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:15.920
that doesn't sound like a past tense to me it doesn't it doesn't sound like I did or was doing it sounds like I have

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:25.080
come to a place where I am done and that's exactly what the perfect is it's from its aspect the verbs have aspect to

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:30.639
them great fantastic this is the morphology you need to learn from unit

01:34:30.639 --> 01:34:37.280
three here are the endings of the perfect and you say wait a minute it's

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:42.440
just like the it's just like the arist except for the third person plural

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:49.040
instead of an is AI isn't that nice and look there's a new movable after in the

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:56.520
third person singular and the third person plural there's a new movable there good you can tack that on the end

01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:03.960
when you get a vowel that follows it in the next word good and here are the examples of I have educated you have

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:11.280
educated he she it has educated etc etc pep people this tense the perfect is

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:18.600
formed from the fourth principal part the fourth principal part okay so all

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:25.520
you do is remove the ending of the fourth principal part right you're going to take off that and you got your stem

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:31.520
and you just add all of these endings to it good give me the next one which is

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:37.239
the pl perfect PL perfect here we go and what is the pl perfect well you just

01:35:37.239 --> 01:35:44.840
take a perfect I have done it right P right you just take that and you add

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:51.880
an Epsilon augment on the front of it to change it from I have taught to I had

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:58.719
taught I had taught it's completed in the past so you

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:04.239
got a past augment on the hug in the front of the verb and you've got that

01:36:04.239 --> 01:36:10.600
ending now and here's your endings look at the morphology AA M

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:16.840
and a a m andan those are your PL

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:24.360
perfects right epel right I had taught

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:31.880
good good now let's move on those are the two tenses you've got to learn in unit three and then we've got couple

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:38.639
couple other things here is your subjunctive ending now I'm only going to give you two tenses the present and the

01:36:38.639 --> 01:36:45.280
arist and here are the present and the erist endings for the subjunctive they're the same in both tenses the only

01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:51.560
difference is you use the first principal part for the present and you use the third principal part for the

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:58.360
arist and that's how you'll be able to tell and that's why I tell people we've got to memorize all our principal parts from

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:03.800
the chapter right luo elusa Lea Lumi

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:10.600
eluan at least remember that one that one good if we're in class together and

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:15.760
there's nine of you I can call on you I can say what are the you know identify

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:22.920
this verb is it first person singular what is it right you can you can say what it is we can drill each other right

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:28.920
so here's the present subjunctive do the next one um and I also brought along and

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:35.600
remember the arist is going to be the same it's going to be the same endings so now we go to the Optive the present

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:41.599
Optive and the arist Optive the present Optive is going to have different looking endings from the aist Optive

01:37:41.599 --> 01:37:48.719
here the present you should be saying that to

01:37:48.719 --> 01:37:54.239
yourself o o o

01:37:54.679 --> 01:38:00.199
isn't that beautiful and so you just add that ending to a present stem p and you

01:38:00.199 --> 01:38:07.639
get p on me isn't that nice okay now don't worry about what it means I just

01:38:07.639 --> 01:38:14.639
want you to be able to reproduce the forms o o o o o o and if I yell at you

01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:20.000
in a classroom if I yell at you what are the present optative endings you'll say

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.159
o o o o o o o o give me the next one what about the aist

01:38:26.159 --> 01:38:31.320
endings well they're close look they look a lot like the present optative but

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:36.679
the arist Optive instead of having the Omron as their preferred vow they've got

01:38:36.679 --> 01:38:43.239
the alpha just like all the other arist have an alpha iy ice I

01:38:43.239 --> 01:38:49.000
IM ion and I want you to notice there's variance for the second person singular

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:55.440
third person singular and the third person plural they're variant

01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:02.520
okay so you got to be aware of that if you want to memorize one Paradigm memorize all the alphas don't memorize

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:07.800
the variance with them so at least you've got that I me ice I I'm an i to

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:15.199
ion good now uh next chart is going to just give us some vocabulary and I want

01:39:15.199 --> 01:39:22.719
people to be working when they work on sentences I want them to be working on vocabulary too what is an Aon right what

01:39:22.719 --> 01:39:32.000
is aot Allah what is and what is oh don't be so virtuous right do you

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:38.840
have a ronin retain their a even though they lose their lord isn't that nice

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:43.880
it's kind of virtue kind of virtue then you got a counsil after that Bole then

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:51.598
you got the verb right look at the principal parts people and compare it to Lu Gra

01:39:54.840 --> 01:40:01.000
right now we've had the first four principal parts you'll learn what the fifth and sixth are later when we get

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:06.679
into passives but for now all we've got to know are those first four principal

01:40:06.679 --> 01:40:11.760
parts fantastic um damos we got lots of people there

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:17.639
democra right when somebody asks you what is is Christian is uh democracy a

01:40:17.639 --> 01:40:23.400
Christian word you tell them no it's not it's a much older Greek Pagan word you

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:30.280
don't have to say Pagan it sounds B classical word right CU pagans do funny things don't modern pagans annoy the

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:36.400
hell out of me Dia is a preposition right and by the way all you have two

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:41.679
pages of notes after these vocabulary um pages and they'll tell you

01:40:41.679 --> 01:40:48.560
things like you know D look it can mean through and that's where we get the meaning diameter right that's where we

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:53.840
derive diameter from what is diameter it's that measurement through the center

01:40:53.840 --> 01:41:00.159
right fantastic oh love it love it uh it's not the circumference right that's

01:41:00.159 --> 01:41:07.320
the runs around oh those stupid Romans anyway look at the verb at the bottom

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:13.639
thth look at that perfecta all you got to do is add your

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:19.360
a and you can you can say I have sacrificed you have sacrificed he she

01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:26.560
has sacrificed etc etc we you they fantastic that is what you have to

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:31.639
know for that this much of that unit the

01:41:31.639 --> 01:41:38.760
rest of the unit we're going to talk about a couple of constructions we're going to talk about how to use the

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:43.920
optative and the subjunctive and I want to ease into that

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:50.679
I want to give you a little bit of time to catch up on your morphology and I want to give you an assignment please

01:41:50.679 --> 01:41:56.040
this is Magic are you ready for the seven people who just left they're going

01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:03.400
