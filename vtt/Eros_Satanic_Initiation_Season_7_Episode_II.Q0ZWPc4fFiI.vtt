00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.919
of the sons of Aaron right and you're doing your thing

00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:46.440

enclosed tent around you you're sucking in that Vapor that's coming off the

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:58.679
burnt offering and you got that rope around your leg and it's tied there so

00:17:58.679 --> 00:18:03.960

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:48.600
voice from the heavens and you you ask yourself why is this plural in all the

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:56.240

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:14.280
plurality it's a plurality do you remember Paul the Apostle getting high pushing that

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:22.480
pushing that thorn pushing that thorn in the flesh getting that snake high do you

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:29.159
remember him doing that you know cursing at the pythia because he is Christ thing

00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:37.159
and she's telling the world about it yeah yeah drug use and junkie Paul he

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:40.559
was even embarrassed about it

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:50.320
himself so where are we at go back to Mark what ises what does Jesus say um yeah so from

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:56.520
the heavens right it comes out he Paul went to these places he went to the third or the seventh I forg I always

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:04.360
forget which number I'm terrible with numbers um but Jesus from those zones is able to

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:10.080
draw that pelma right and he's hearing a voice and we're all standing around

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:16.679
looking at Jesus and his Baptist Getting Nuts right getting high and hearing

00:20:16.679 --> 00:20:22.240

coming from the split within the heavens are you looking up if you're looking up

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:56.000
for a dove you know painting a picture where where's the dove look at some of

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.120
the stupid portraits that come come out of the Byzantine world look at that

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:07.360
stupid stuff that comes out with with respect to this it looks not only does

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:13.240
it look fairy tale it's just it's unbelievably bad classical art when

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.640
class the classical world was overthrown the art was sucked out the

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:24.159
backside of the world I can say that because I'm free to say that to you

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:29.440
there's no Professor on the planet that will tell you this but Christian killed

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:37.320
Western Art it killed it killed it dead you ever seen what It produced in its

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:43.880
place they look like zombie people yeah they look like zombie people

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:50.880
we went as Humanity we went from a place of knowing Aeros we went from a place of

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.520
worshiping Aphrodite we went from that

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:04.120
place we went from that place to a place of looking at men who look like zombies

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:10.720
in cloaks that don't show the body they hung crosses on everything

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:16.080
they killed your art and for a thousand years you entered the Dark

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:22.799
Ages when you finally climbed out of the pit through the

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:29.960
Renaissance you got your bearings back there's a constant time coming to wash

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:36.080
away civilization whether it was the Greeks when they were holding the football or

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:43.080
whether it was the Romans when they were holding the football or whether it's you and I holding the football that

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.760
Civilization is in our hands yeah yeah and there's always a force against it

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:57.200
let's keep going people didn't like that I brought up things about world world happenings I

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.440
only have to say that um you know there's a certain there's a certain

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:10.000
element of the present that must be injected to make this worth your time go let's hit the next one love it

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.360
Mark 1 one yeah this this great voice yeah let's go on so the voice is speaking but why we even mention this

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:24.440
and immediately the pelma the spirit through him right it literally

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:30.080
boom you know how all these guys get high in the Bible and see

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.520
Visions they do it as they said themselves through the

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:43.240
PMA through that Spirit through that air have you ever been with Aus and he's

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:49.320
caught that air and he's in that place where he can see the things that you

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:56.559
can't yeah that's what we're talking about Jesus gets the PMA

00:23:56.559 --> 00:24:01.799
now I will just say from experience because I've been hounded by

00:24:01.799 --> 00:24:09.440
charismatics charismatics love to come and pray demons away um for some reason I attract them

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:15.320
can you believe that I think it's my good looks but it maybe something else

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:22.279
um anywh who um this whole demon possession thing right that is the power

00:24:22.279 --> 00:24:28.799
that is controlled when you have that pilma of God that's when you get to step

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:36.520
out of that chronic world into what's the ionic the ionic is what you modern

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:41.679
day Christians translate as Eternal and it's totally wrong and you don't know

00:24:41.679 --> 00:24:47.480
what you're talking about which is sad because you originally did and your people did a much better

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:54.279
job when they were all using the drugs and entering the orgies these are sex

00:24:54.279 --> 00:25:02.279
rights people do did you wonder why we're talking about a virgin we don't sacrifice a virgin we don't sacrifice

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:08.919
the Virgin are you kidding she's the source of our medicine don't be

00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:14.120
stupid right um but if she says somebody else should be sacrificed that's

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:19.799
different right because we entrust that power we entrust that power to the God

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:25.200
because you see all of this is built upon possession people ask about

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:31.760
possession oh I'm sorry okay we're almost people ask about possession and

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:37.200
they think oh my goodness this is a this is a weird esoteric topic no no no it is

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:44.760
the driving force of Classical Mystery the driving force it's a central element

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:50.519
when Jesus comes to Mary and casts out her seven

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:58.679
demons what do you think he came here to do right to exert control command over

00:25:58.679 --> 00:26:04.960
those forces fantastic hence the boys right you need the boy for the Jesus if

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:10.559
he's going to be doing the christing and chasing the demons and you commanding

00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:17.520
the power of babul he's gonna be using this magic

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.679
okay let's go to there's the next test yeah and so the spirit threw him now watch this people I'm going to prove to

00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:29.120
you right now and this is not a heady argument I'm just going to point out to

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:34.919
you these last three words in this sentence are a prepositional phrase into

00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:43.559
the Edon right into the what's translated as desert or Wilderness or void into the

00:26:43.559 --> 00:26:49.840
void now people think this is a place a location here on Earth he walked out

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.440
into the Judean desert no how do we know that for a fact because when that desert

00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:01.520
is an actual location give me the next one you're going to see Mark

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:08.480
himself um invest in a word that uh wh it's the next one but wait um yeah go to

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:15.080
the next one this one oh that one you're gonna see Mark use a word to explicitly

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:20.520
Express that this is a location and that is the second word on the second line

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:26.080
topon Place notice that it's right next to a rayon because at this time Jesus

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:33.120
and his buddies go off by themselves and by buddies I mean all of his children that he's with right they go we know we

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:39.760
know right you did you know the apostles were all teenagers yeah you didn't and then I told you and you know now so

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:45.720
let's go on okay so he's he's taking his boys off for a lunch break because it says on the bottom line he didn't have

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.960
any time to eat bro he's getting bothered by people right and so what

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:56.600
happens what happens he gets sent into the he says hey um let's go take a lunch

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:04.640
break go off to the to the place the Aron so this is very specific Mark is

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:11.799
not talking when Mark says Jesus went into the Wilderness to meet with the

00:28:11.799 --> 00:28:21.840
devil to be tried of the Devil he's not going to a topos a place he is going

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:29.519
into the void which is what we do when we participate in Mysteries do you see

00:28:29.519 --> 00:28:34.679
why we all come out of it demon possessed right it's a process it's a

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:41.080
process it's an anthropological process a place for you to get your mind to

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:47.159
right a place for you to get your mind to good let's go to the next one we've got to hustle through some of these

00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:53.159
sources here no I won't hustle people I'll treat you good I promise but I got a lot of good stuff look at this oh who

00:28:53.159 --> 00:29:01.200
are the people who are going to enter into the hos deos the second death now remember

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.360
take it down for a minute the second death when

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.840
Adonis dies he leaves

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:20.519
Aphrodite and he is a welcomed on the other side while she

00:29:20.519 --> 00:29:26.440
Mourns he is welcomed we are going into the void with Adonis for those of you

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:33.919
with ears to hear he goes into the void Now flip your polarity around you're no longer with

00:29:33.919 --> 00:29:39.399
Aphrodite mourning the dead Adonis you're with the Kora the queen of the

00:29:39.399 --> 00:29:47.039
underworld and what are you doing is he's coming he's coming back he is

00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:54.720
resurrecting but he's going the opposite direction this is the second death and

00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:02.760
this is what those of us who part participate in the mystery of

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:09.240
anomia this is what we pursue we pursue the second death bring

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:14.960
that bring that um back up and do you know what kind of people are involved in

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:21.279
the second death these are the people these wretched apisto these wretched

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:26.480
faithless people right no we don't need Faith you don't need faith when you're

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:33.440
in the second death you don't need Faith right um You you got a you got a whole

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:41.279
pharmacology to back you up right we'll take you right there into the second death imagine a cult where people were

00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:46.840
being purposely put into a death State and then

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:52.919
resurrected why because ad Donis the pole has switched and Adonis is now

00:30:52.919 --> 00:31:00.440
entering the underworld and when he enters we celebrate a marriage we

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:07.600
celebrate a marriage do you think Aeros has power on Only Over The Air now he

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:14.360
has power over that dark matter that makes up the under that makes up that

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:21.880
void he has power there isn't that amazing you know the only thing it can never be conquered in the mind of an

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:28.440
oric power of AOS unconquerable oh God you got to love it

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:34.960
okay let's go back let's go back you thought Jesus was going into a Wilderness I think that's hilarious um

with all the rest of the description that he provides perfectly he's being

00:36:08.359 --> 00:36:13.640

in a high where he is um using the drugs to project his vision into the

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:50.880
ion okay you want to know why he needs those beasties there to listen to the

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:58.400
angels because he ain't hearing or seeing any Angels unless he is stoned

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:07.400
out of his brain on those serpents this is a serpent cult when he

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:14.520
tells his children his lamkins when he tells his lamkins I you

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:20.480

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:43.200
snakes were Central why do you think she has seven stars in her hand why do you

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:49.640
think the formula is composed of those seven plus all the other

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:56.319
ingredients yeah yeah it's a you know it's a look it's a mystery and you

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:09.960
challenge to the Christians tonight um and those of you who who you know are

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:16.280
have seen those of you with eyes to see who have seen the reality you've seen

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:23.440

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:29.160
with you know next time they try to ram him down your throat tell him give me

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:35.640

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:41.599
with that naked boy I guarantee you if you tell your Christian relative this

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:46.920
it's going to end the conversation just gonna end the conversation I right now

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:54.400
am trying to figure out how to bring this information to the public in a way

00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:03.119
that they won't just walk away away as soon as they hear it cuz that's what happens it happens in

00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:08.319
regular conversation and it happens in interviews right you start talking about

00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:13.480
Jesus's naked kid you start talking about Paul being a junkie you start

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:21.240
talking about John with his penis shaped cup you start talking ancient bonic

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:29.680
ritual and people get scared and they run they run so we we have to be um have

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:35.640
a platform to bring this to people so that they can see it they have to be a it's the museum we got to bring it back

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:41.040
let's go I'm taking I want to take you to the priest here I just want you to look at the first two lines here look at

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:50.000
the first two lines yeah we're talking about a kidna we're talking about vipers these terrible biting vipers right and

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:58.240
um so this is be uh this is kind of sandwiched in the work of a a um priest

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:05.480
of Apollo and you say what is a priest of Apollo Pion right Pion the Healer did

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:11.880
you ever wonder why the Christ is the great physician did you ever wonder that Jesus wasn't a doctor where did he get

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:18.800
his was he down in Egypt went to medical school where's my whip let's whip it out of him Jesus did you go to medical

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:26.400
school in Egypt Jesus oh he keeps quiet all the time he's no fun man you can smack him and

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:32.520
smack him and smack him you know and he just sits there quiet I don't get it I

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:39.280
don't get it but um it's hard to get answers out of them right Jesus is a quiet fellow when it comes to

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:46.079
necromancy um but that's okay we got enough on the record of what he already said to put him away forever you know

00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:51.720
what I mean so okay let's go let's let's bring it to the uh that second of those

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:58.119
this one um look I'm going to give you a secret because you've come tonight here is is a secret within a secret that

00:43:58.119 --> 00:44:04.800
you're supposed to be picking up from the Epsilon here is a secret within a secret it's like a commercial within a

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:12.800
you know within a show here we go look at the bottom two lines halfway across logos G Men horp

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:19.480
OD oh everybody recognize OD thereus right

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:26.040
E oil you know you know what that means

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:32.559
means go ahead and take it down that is a helenistic

00:44:32.559 --> 00:44:40.520
um priest of Apollo who is the physician the holy physician who knows

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:46.720
the Christ right he knows what that is he knows that category of

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:52.880
drugs um and so he's goingon to be putting he's gonna be piling into his poetry a whole bunch of stuff and he's

00:44:52.880 --> 00:45:00.119
writing to another priest from somewhere else so they got there's mystery religion W there's more

00:45:00.119 --> 00:45:05.720
Christianity in this guy who who is before Christianity um there's more

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:11.359
Christianity in this text than there is in the New Testament 10 times over it's

00:45:11.359 --> 00:45:19.160
um the raw anthropology is all there he says hey you know what really happened to odys and this is why Jesus has to be

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:27.480
the sa has to be the the Pion the Healer right the Divine physician um

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:34.880
because of the capacity to do exactly this what he's doing to be able to step

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:42.760
forward and to be able to um to push that Son of God to the place that they

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:50.559
need to be bring us um what happens to odyss right are you ready he dies and

00:45:50.559 --> 00:45:57.520
how does he die well people don't know it but this priest is telling you right those of us who are in the know know

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:06.240
that osius died from pushing that poison right he was like Paul he was addicted

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:11.319
and he was pushing that poison to get to the seventh heaven how do we know that

00:46:11.319 --> 00:46:17.640
about aysus how do we know that he's a junkie we have Odus the first time he

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:24.640
ever appears to us in Homer he's not looking for the arrow poison he's not

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:31.200
looking for it they know people other people don't want to give it to them the guy finds he doesn't want to give it to them it's too dangerous right you're

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:40.480
going to kill yourself with this stuff guess what says nicander he did he did and that stuff is so strong

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:47.280
if you don't have the right thec you're it's G to kill you you're G to be dead

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:53.359
right but this is what the people go through everybody in in the congregation

00:46:53.359 --> 00:47:01.599
tonight this is what people go through in order to get into the right in order

00:47:01.599 --> 00:47:08.400
to come through that initiation and then in order to sustain that Holy Spirit in

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:14.240
order to bring that Holy Spirit how do you think Paul made it up into the third

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:20.040
fourth fifth sixth Heaven how how do you think he made it up there he made it

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:26.559
with this process with the mystery he made it with this la

00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:32.359
pad of the compound drugs they're all there in the text the

00:47:32.359 --> 00:47:39.640
language is there screaming screaming but we don't hear it right we don't hear

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:46.599
it you why because we've been through the Dark Ages this knowledge has been

00:47:46.599 --> 00:47:55.240
kept from you in order to construct a false image that would control you I

00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:03.440
know that sounds like we're living in The Matrix I know it does yeah and I can't deny it I can't

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:10.240
deny it that is what people do when they rewrite history when they

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:17.119
appropriate when there is no visible record and you have to take Traditions

00:48:17.119 --> 00:48:23.079
to yourself it's what cultures do they appropriate what is

00:48:23.079 --> 00:48:30.760
valuable and what is most valuable I'm going to say this tonight and I know that um you guys have heard this maybe

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:40.040
before but I'm going to say it tonight Humanity reached its linguistic Apex

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:49.520
with ancient Greek all languages are not created equal Greek came and survived and

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:55.680
expanded and developed and destroyed other languages

00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:04.839
that were too weak for the onslaught those languages were holding people

00:49:04.839 --> 00:49:10.319
back we as human beings evolved a

00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:15.920
capacity to expand our own minds our

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:21.640
vision to get our brain to develop and fire on all of the receptors that it's

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:28.799
got all of those receptors for the for Starion all of those receptors those

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:36.799
opiates all of those receptors all of those those compounds that those proteins that

00:49:36.799 --> 00:49:41.880
come from the snake Venoms that work upon the your

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:48.079
hormones yeah yeah huh yeah all of that

00:49:48.079 --> 00:49:54.319
designed to bring you a virgin that's the mystery and that

00:49:54.319 --> 00:50:01.319
virgin has the w Water of Life and she won't be here unless we produce her

00:50:01.319 --> 00:50:09.079
that's lady Babylon and that is what the Christians are so afraid of she is the

00:50:09.079 --> 00:50:14.240
enemy The Devil's not he doesn't take sinner stage the dragon doesn't take not

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:23.240
even the Beast the Antichrist they're all foils what are they foils for lady Babylon let's go to the last text um I

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:29.440

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:40.599
looking at Homer here right so people who talk to you on YouTube and say oh

00:50:40.599 --> 00:50:46.920
the Greek says this and the Greek says that there's people who talk about KN Greek and there's people who actually

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:52.599
translate Greek let's let's look at what happens here so there's a banquet going

over she boils over and in that sense she exhales or she

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:22.200
ejaculates right and it's that essence of

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:28.640
Aphrodite that is the resurrection mystery why are the Christians take it

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:35.000
down why are the Christians warning you not to hang out with the people who are using the drugs and who were involved in

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:42.200
the sex and the temple worship with the children why not be involved with these

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:48.319
people yeah why not be involved with these idolators because they were if

00:55:48.319 --> 00:55:56.520
they're having to root that out in the early church it means they were it means it's an integral part of Christianity

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:03.280
it's the reason we just found the reason that Jesus when he's arrested screams

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:08.440
out I am not a trafficker I am not a child

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:14.000
trafficker these drugs that they're using within the cult maintain control

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.119
imagine this people just for a second and I'll end on this and I um I want to

00:56:19.119 --> 00:56:25.520
get my goat in a second don't bring him up yet uh her up I'm sorry um

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:30.880
but um what happens um if you've got a

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:36.720
religion you need to maintain control of your people you need them to believe

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:42.440
certain things you need them to act certain ways you need them to baptize their kids you need them to marry within

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:51.280
the church you got to control all of those aspects of their life from birth to death it's what religio does it's

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:57.559
what religio does now imagine this your religion has people who are initiated

00:56:57.559 --> 00:57:03.839
who come in not knowing and they leave knowing they leave born

00:57:03.839 --> 00:57:10.280
again they leave Born Again these second

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:17.119
deaths enter into this state and receive some kind of

00:57:17.119 --> 00:57:24.119
knowledge and in the process they are written into the scroll

00:57:24.119 --> 00:57:30.079
of Zoe isn't that nice isn't that nice and why

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:35.720

you you you cannot give up the Virgin you cannot turn away from the Virgin

00:57:42.079 --> 00:57:49.079
it's her song if you forsake the Virgin Mary everything is done you can wrap up

00:57:49.079 --> 00:57:54.799
your religion it's gone that's what they're doing the mystery for in order

00:57:54.799 --> 00:58:00.359
