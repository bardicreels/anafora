Muse tonight I'm going to show you I'm going to do something very

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.520
straightforward and simple I know everybody has time constraints so here's

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:06.000

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.479
Isaiah chapter 3 but we're going to look at it in the way that you've never looked at it before we're going to look

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.039
at it in the original language in which it was

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.639
written which is Greek and you're going to

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:30.080
see how the translation slope from

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:37.720

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.400
plummet you're gonna see it oh God what are we gonna do I'm gonna show you those

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:36.479
native Greek and I'm we're going to look at technical terms look at this pay

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:44.240
attention says the Lord desperate who rules Sabah he's going to take away from those

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:54.200
judeans and from those jerusalemites every strong man and every strong woman

00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:00.200
he's going to take the strength of your bread and water

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:06.040
okay now that was the translation right Applause chewy we need some kind of

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.720
Applause um no yeah not really uh what

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:18.560
does pray tell what does the Hebrew make of this because what you're looking at

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:27.519
what I'm going to show you is the Hebrew translation of that Greek text now that

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:32.920
gets us into a little background you can brainwash them with pictures now that

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:41.040
gets us into a little necessary background there's a letter and this letter is a

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:49.600
forgery but the letter states that the people um who

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.079
wrote the um septu aent that that was a

00:09:55.079 --> 00:10:02.399
group of rabbis 72 of them I've got 72 slides tonight 72 of them and that they

00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:08.120
got together and um by the power of Yahoo

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.959
they all came up with the same translation um wonderful just a

00:10:13.959 --> 00:10:21.240
beautiful beautiful fairy tale but that fairy tale was meant for a

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:27.320
reason what I'm going to show you now is the translation of that into Hebrew

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:34.880
which remember this is is the third Century okay third Century Hebrews been

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:42.639
dead As Dead As Dead can get I want to ask you before we begin

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:49.560
this before I show you the Hebrew I I want to ask

00:10:49.560 --> 00:11:00.360
you give me the name of one Hebrew author outside of the

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:07.600
in Greek the tlg will tell you we've got a good standard

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:14.600
400ish okay um if you were to take all the names of all the authors that are

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:23.040
quoted from the ancient text that we've got you've got thousands upon

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:31.240
thousands give me the name of one Hebrew author

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:39.320
outside of the Old Testament give me one name surely they have medical writers

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:45.079
everybody's got medical writers even the Egyptians even the Egyptians have

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:51.360
medical right and you say oh well the Egyptians were ho HOA

00:11:53.040 --> 00:12:00.720
booha this is literature we're talking about writing this is evident

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:08.000
we're not here for ideas we're here for evidence yes okay so let's see what

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.519
happens when you take that and now you're trying to forge tonight's show is all about

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:20.680
forgery and fraudulence if you are

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:27.320
fraudulent you'll be found out tonight on the big lie oh I love it

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:33.480
it sounds like a detective show or something I'd love that who is that jwy

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:40.360
is that is that a saint is that a saint oh it's Isaiah there he is thank you

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:47.399
he's got a nice desk I like that nice job Isaiah okay let's keep going give me

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:54.600
the next one because it's the Hebrew now that we're going to jump to go hit it oh first The New International Version see

00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:00.720
now the Lord the Lord Almighty is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:07.399
Supply and support all supplies of food and all supplies of

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:14.360
water okay terribly off from the Greek what happened to the strong man and the

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.680
strong woman because ladies you're gonna love it it's all

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:26.839
full of women tonight remember Yahoo loves child sacrifice and hates

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:33.839
women right this is blatant bold misogyny you know why he hated them here

00:13:33.839 --> 00:13:39.519
in Isaiah because they were ruling they

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:45.279
Ares are you kidding they're rulers take them

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:50.920
out yes yes that's you have to remember don't forget Yahoo and I'm going to show

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:57.959

00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:04.480
get the thing on here who oh prophets

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:13.079
buttocks that's what we have a prophets bucks oh love it okay go to the next one

00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:19.560
what is that new international version based on all the English is going to be

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:29.399
based on the mastic Hebrew fiction of the 9th and 10th centuries

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:39.600
okay that's what it is remember the Dead Sea Scrolls everybody thinks the Dead Sea Scrolls were like um you know Hebrew

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:46.480
um Originals no why do you think they found them with Greek because the Greek text

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:54.240
had been long established yes it's the sad fact of one

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.880
language dying when another comes in and totally takes it

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:07.199
out yes oh it was a Slaughter my God what Greek did and to how many languages

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:14.959
did Greek do it oh God people think Alexander the

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:22.360
Great um spread Hellenism um I got news for you he

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:31.240
spread the language and the language consumed consumed it set the people on

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:38.360
fire right oh love it love the language go to it go to it yep yep here's the

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:45.880
Hebrew now okay here's the Hebrew blow it up for me to I gotta get my glasses so here's that same verse you know who's

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.839
the Lord we're talking about here um Yahweh see Yahweh there um that's cuos

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:59.240
right they love people love to translate that um it's Yahweh um some of the some

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:07.040
of the things that you see like they'll use one word in Greek to translate two different Hebrew words right so get

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:14.440
ready for the vocabulary skill to drop through the floor are you ready um yeah

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:21.720
so behold the Lord Yahweh the Lord of hosts takes that's Sabo right takes away

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:30.399
from Jerusalem and from Jordan what is this the stock and the store what happened to my dude and my dude that

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:35.800
what happened to him they got rid of him they got rid of him that's

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:41.240
interesting what happened let's keep let's keep going see if this mystery will pull itself together give me the

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:48.920
Hebrew term what is the Hebrew term we're concerned about Mission a support or staff that

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:56.360
has nothing to do with a person whoever was translating this from the Greek had

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:02.680
to rely upon much more simpler Expressions why because at the time

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:08.678
Greek was lurgical I mean Hebrew was lurgical there's nothing they could do there's Greek all over the walls of your

00:17:08.679 --> 00:17:16.600
synagogues right so this is a Hebrew problem um not a cultural or historical

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:24.880
problem the Hebrew language was inadequate it was inadequate so I'm I'm

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.919
going to show you technically um how a language that has less technical

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:36.520
terminology and is functioning at a lower level um can't bear the signal of

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:42.200
that Hightech and we're gonna prove that tonight with a purple oh I love it love

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:49.280
this stuff okay let's go thank you people for coming thank you thank you Gnostic I will be there um go to the

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.760
next one and look this is verse two what else is the uh is Yahoo going to take

00:17:54.760 --> 00:18:00.600
from everybody look at verse two he's going to take the Giant

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:07.799
and he's going to take the strong and the person who is the war

00:18:07.799 --> 00:18:13.840
trained and the diecast he's going to take what the diecast I hang on to that

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.960
thought what else is he gonna take he's gonna take the Prophet The Prophet wait what's a

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.960
prophet let's see um then he's gonna take

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:31.600
the and the old person the Elder you could say he's going to

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.799
take all that stuff away because you know those are the resources of those communities now let's see what the

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:42.960
Hebrew text does with this let's see I think I got a picture don't you chewy

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:49.559
let's see what the Hebrew text does yeah there we go oh here we go the

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:55.000
Mighty Man and the man of war right so I

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.720
just got to warn you the Greek here used a very specific adjective um indicating a type of person

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:09.200
who has been trained in the Arts of War um the Hebrew has to use much more

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:16.840
simpler man of war right do you hear how the level of

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:22.360
specificity drops yes okay keep going they got the

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.400
Elder right wait what else did they put there I forgot to um oh they say the

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:34.039
judge and the the prophet and the divor and the Elder right they got the Elder

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:40.520
in there let's see about the others let's bring me up a let's see how close they hit Roger that let me see how close

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:45.679
they got here's the man of war right that ish of

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:50.840
War right is Isha right um look at the

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:56.960
Simplicity of the expression hit me the next one um what is that in the Greek

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:05.480
original now it's specifically somebody trained in the Arts of War it is a technical

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:12.080
station or post give me the next one or we gonna yeah you can come back to that go

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:18.760
ahead yeah boom um what it is the war is

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:25.039
it anything specific or is it just kind of no it's just battle of War ride

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:31.559
mahama okay go go to the next one cool all all right I'm I'm feeling it um what

00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:37.919
is a decastes what is that that's a judge so on the Hebrew side they got the

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:44.919
judge part but I want you to look at this word how much more

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:52.000
specific we've got to go look in Athens just notice where we are there's a

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.799
linguist notice where we are in Athens it means a juror

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:04.520
okay can it mean a judge yes it's a juror it's also this thing it was very

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:10.520
popular in the ancient world the Avenger the Avenger right that's a

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:17.640
servant of DK that's as Pagan as it gets um the Avenger right great go to the

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:24.039
next one that's what our diecast is what do we get on the Hebrew side H it really

00:21:24.039 --> 00:21:30.000
is coming from this verb right it's non specifically judging

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.720
or governing now my problem is the Greek already has a verb for one who sits in

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:45.039
judgment as a governor and I think that's what this is probably closest to

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:52.400
and they would have known that if I know that they would have known that in Antiquity yeah their linguists are great

00:21:52.400 --> 00:22:00.480
right Classics is the first education yeah love it the museum comes

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:06.640
from it okay so we we're going from the specific to the general um when we go

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.720
from the Greek to the Hebrew now remember the story is that it went from

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:18.840
Hebrew to Greek so as you're thinking about these translations realize what the person who

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:26.480
would be translating it into Greek would have to do to ramp up um that technical

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:35.960
expertise right you e you you either can do a triple Lots or you can't and um uh Hebrew was not able to

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:41.159
do the triple Lots okay and it's not the only language there's a ton in Italy all

00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:47.600
those dialects that the Romans wiped out linguistically same thing right there

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:54.960
are strong languages and there are weak languages yeah yeah love it now um yeah

00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:00.880
here's your Prophet people what else did he say he's going to take from him prophets I just want you to notice okay

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:07.880
this is yeah one who speaks for a God that sounds pretty good I want you to notice how many references there are to

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:16.159
different classical works that use this Greek word Prophet Prophet okay um notice blow it

00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:21.520
up notice that uh it's a Herold sure um look at the very bottom look at the very

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:29.880
bottom go to the next [Music] slide what does it say it says

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.440
herbalist you mean your Prophet is an herbalist I would have one objection yes

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:41.840
but it's more of in a medical sense so I would say

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:51.320
pharmacologist yeah that's what I would put it you mean your prophets were on dope yes they were yes they

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:58.039
were love it um go to the next one look at the three and four here

00:23:58.039 --> 00:24:04.760
people an expounder of the utterances of the Mantis you guys know the Mantis and

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:10.039
the Mantic art you know that that's all through Apollo right you thought the

00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:18.120
word Prophet was no it's not Charlton hon right no it's not that's a fantasy

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:24.000
world it's part of the big lie right we're peeling back that big lie tonight

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.880
look at three and four you know possessor of oracular powers look at where they're going they're going to the

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:36.799
oracles look it's used of epines he was a cool guy who had tattoos

00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:45.720
all over himself and he would carried this Cults hoof and in it he would put

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:56.159
this white root that he would snort yeah yeah they kept his

00:24:56.159 --> 00:25:02.840
skin turned it into a book why not go to the next one let's go to the next one AR

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:08.440
people commenting I'm going get people's comments in a minute chewy if there's any good comments throw them up there um

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:15.240
look people what is the prophet on the Hebrew side uh spokesman a

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:22.360
speaker okay but then you're using a Greek term to Define your Hebrew term because you sing Prophet right that's a

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:28.320
greatek term yeah so do you see the depth here I

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:35.840
I asked you before could you name me one Hebrew author from Antiquity outside and

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:42.559
I'm not talking I'm talking BC okay outside of the

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.720
septuagenarian is late Iron Age what uh

00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:01.200
um aren't we going to have some kind of record are we going to have some kind of

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.960
written no you're not because the stuff doesn't exist the oldest inscriptions of

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:12.480
Hebrew people question them as even being Hebrew

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:18.360
right yeah it's not the history that you thought was there it was the history

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:24.640
that was Amplified that you've been fed that you're living in that you're

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.559
breathing yes okay go keep going let's give Isaiah another spanking Let's go

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:36.279
people love it while you can while it's hot oh which one

00:26:36.279 --> 00:26:45.279
here okay here we go and what is a on this is something um a conjecture I like

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:51.799
that I like that look look where it says um that's pus they're talking about and

00:26:51.799 --> 00:27:00.480
is he roughly contemporary yeah he's in the same range where our auor th of the septu

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:06.840
agent are so the the person who really wrote the books of Moses in the third

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:13.080
Century um we're getting closer to their specific lingo and this is one of the

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:18.279
words fantastic what's he gonna do he's gonna take away the people who can come

00:27:18.279 --> 00:27:23.399
up with the right plan right he's gonna take that away

00:27:23.399 --> 00:27:29.120
it's a resource I told you these are all resources that he's got there it makes much more sense than the

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:36.880
than it does the terrible dumb down Hebrew translation um it's a shame this is a beautiful text go to the next one

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:45.720
here we go what's the what's the word for that they're using for that they're using this one right Kasam and what does

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:51.320
that mean well to practice divination are you kidding me

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:57.000
okay what does that mean that's not a definition it's not a defin it's like a

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.760
cat sh allw okay what car are you in well I'm driving

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.840
thanks yeah yeah it's very non-specific and that's the problem

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:15.679
because remember Hebrew only has about 8,000 unique words right they didn't they miss basic

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:21.679
words why don't we have them because it got slaughtered as a language it was

00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:27.320
only the attempt to bring it back starting in the second century right the

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:34.039
synagogues are still full of Greek right people realized oh we need

00:28:34.039 --> 00:28:43.120
some kind of original to take command of this text yeah yeah isn't that something and

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:49.159
so they they wrote it they created it they were already doing it with the Dead Sea

00:28:49.159 --> 00:28:56.720
Scrolls right they had the Greek Originals there and they had the Hebrew copies of them okay watch this watch how

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:02.519
the technical language it shows it every time it's the technical language hit me

00:29:02.519 --> 00:29:08.640
with the next one are you sure we're that far okay um yeah that uh look at

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:14.600
verse number three who else is Yahoo gonna remove from society look at that

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:20.679
first word on the second line pon

00:29:20.679 --> 00:29:26.039
pon what is that sounds important right look at that look at the length of that

00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:33.080
people I don't do this always but just just love the length of that first word

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:40.120
on the second line can everybody see that love the look at that how many I'd

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:47.799
like to measure that word I'd like to measure it I would it might cause some

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:54.960
frightening reactions it's gorgeous isn't it pente oh it even

00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:01.360
sounds it sounds like I don't know I know it's makes me want to you know put

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:08.039
on some music um sorry I got drawn in and what else is Yahoo gonna take away

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:13.200
he's gonna take away the Pent contar the

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:19.159
what he's going to take away um a specific position what is that thing

00:30:19.159 --> 00:30:26.039
let's see let's see chewy Give me the give me the next slide what is that looks like it's got the word five in it

00:30:26.039 --> 00:30:33.320
no give me the next one after that this one no there we go that's it that's it look at this people Commander it's a

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:40.640
commander of how many of 50 right 50 look where it's Landing it's

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:46.600
Landing in xenophon and he tells us this is somebody who serves under the treea

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:52.880
horse this is the triarch yeah and what does he do he's

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:59.120
like an admiral yeah he has to outfit a tri

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:07.279
Dre yeah yeah so um this is a very specific once again

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:15.039
Athenian word okay let's see what the Hebrew did with it let's see let's see I'm willing

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:23.399
to bet it's not nearly as specific blow it up yeah put it up there and blow it up this is fantastic oh God what's the

00:31:23.399 --> 00:31:30.279
jury say look the captain of 50 so use the number 50 and put the word

00:31:30.279 --> 00:31:38.519
for captain in there because you don't have this position right so do you see um for the

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:43.880
Greek to be a translation of the Hebrew the dude would have to be

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:50.039
stoned he would have to be like oh God how can I Jazz this up how can I you

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:56.600
know what I mean so the captain the 50 that's not real that's not real um

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:02.240
inspiring right but it's blunt and to the point it's blunting to the point uh

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:09.200
it's a loss of technicality and and watch as the as you wash out the technicality it becomes nonsense the

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:16.519
translation becomes nonsense and by the way you can do this with any chapter of the septu agent right you might as well

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:21.600
throw a throw a dart at which chapter and whatever you hit try that you it's

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.960
full of laughs linguistic laughs oh it's hilarious it's hilariously bad it's all

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:34.480
so sad I feel like playing a violin or something give me the next one give me the next one yeah there's the captain of

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:40.519
the 50 we know we saw that let's go on the next okay and there's our commander

00:32:40.519 --> 00:32:47.679
who's serving under the triarch yeah yeah okay keep going what else is he gonna take he's gonna take away the Su

00:32:47.679 --> 00:32:52.880
Buon oh now this is fantastic Give me the definition that's coming up what is

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:58.039
a suon watch this people this is going to grow your brain

00:32:58.039 --> 00:33:03.279
this is an advisor or counselor okay public or private cool

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:10.120
that's cool look at all the sources around it and you're going to notice Athenian fifth century the

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:16.159
majority the first orders up there the first comedians up

00:33:16.159 --> 00:33:24.799
there yeah the first tragedians up there and a bunch of others oh God oh God look

00:33:24.799 --> 00:33:30.399
at it as a title at Athens the theseso thi okay the

00:33:30.399 --> 00:33:37.600
theseso they're the ones who appointed the sumoy and

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:46.760
this is what Yahoo is g to take from you now who is you the audience of this

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:52.919
are third Century disenfranchised

00:33:52.919 --> 00:33:58.010
culturally Jewish religious

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:04.639
[Music] extremists right these are the guys in the caves copying

00:34:04.639 --> 00:34:11.079
documents right brilliant move to do so because when you generate the big lie

00:34:11.079 --> 00:34:16.720
you take a hold of the narrative it gives you grounding and justification to

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:22.960
do whatever you want to do and that usually involves the seizure

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:29.079
and acquisition of some land some resource

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:35.919
that's how that works yeah now how can I say that

00:34:35.919 --> 00:34:43.878
because that's exactly what they do with the language if you look at the language as a resource right that's what this is doing

00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:49.280
it's trying to draw down that's what the Hebrew is doing it's trying to draw down

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:55.280
that sophisticated Greek but put it into a vessel that was

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:01.480
incapable of carrying it was too much right burst the

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:07.760
pot okay let's go hit me the next one let's hit it oh yeah here we go um this

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:14.440
is the council fine to advise or to counsel right okay I think that's you

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:19.520
know I think that's acceptable let's give him that one nice job nice job

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:25.520
whoever did this nice job what about this one what' you guys do with the

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:32.400
architecton isn't that a good one look that's big one too everybody in Greek you see the AR sitting in there and the

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.720
tech right oh that production production is getting to me

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:44.160
it's from the AR so what how what we how we gonna Define it right stretch your

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:51.680
mind everybody the chief artier artificer excuse me the master

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:58.599
builder the director of works this is a guy who builds your Bridges it says in

00:35:58.599 --> 00:36:04.520
Greek it's got Herodotus it's got Aristotle look where are we again

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:10.000
vocabulary wise people where are we again we're hitting Square every time at

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.680
the fifth century down to the third we're hitting it Square this is the

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:22.560
exact language that we would expect coming out of the thir Century exactly

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:29.880
uh uh an author a contriver and look at the final one at Athens by the way this is the manager of the State Theater and

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:37.119
of the dionisia Great Festival right he's going to take those away from you and you say

00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:42.240
wait a minute where am I culturally Because

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:49.440
unless I am mistaken the people of Israel do not

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:54.520
worship bakas and that's who he's talking about he goes on Pro the prophet

00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:00.359
Isaiah goes on to talk about those assemblies that we make those parades

00:37:00.359 --> 00:37:09.040
that we make and all the women are there and you got your girls out and they're gossamer clothing and we're all getting

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:18.280
aroused why aren't they in burkas right that's the that's Isaiah 3

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:24.480
it's bakic rights so you have to ask yourself why in a text am I reading

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:32.440
about bakic rights in Judea right oh isn't that something isn't that

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:39.599
something um remember we are sitting in the 3D Century BC and we have been

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:45.520
culturally disenfranchised and a lot of us became Traders and

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:52.640
embraced the Greek ways yeah now they're doing what they're doing totally

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:58.400
integrated right if you are an extremist

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:05.040
you understand the power of the logos that's what they used in

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:13.920
Antiquity those histories that material from the libraries yeah that was the

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:21.480
reality so when somebody comes along and tries to fake a text and say oh this is the

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:28.319
original they're doing it for a very good reason right legitimacy

00:38:28.319 --> 00:38:36.520
when you need legitimacy and are willing to sacrifice everything for it you

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:42.480
fabricate now it's an unfortunate reality of History don't think that the

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:48.800
Christians didn't Mount up that wave and ride it all the way in even though

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:55.359
people like africanist julus africanas was saying this text is not written um

00:38:55.359 --> 00:39:01.880
in Hebrew you people are nuts and origin's like that's all he could do he just

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:07.520
Shrugged he Shrugged it off what he want me to do right let's ride this thing

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:13.599
it's too bad it's too bad why do we care at satanic initiation because that's not

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:19.520
the history that's not the history the history is this text is Greek

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:26.839
originally yeah yeah and it's got some things in it they're lovely watch this let's go let's go to the next one let's

00:39:26.839 --> 00:39:34.720
convert everybody chewy it's the lanes are full of here's your skillful Artisan so I

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:42.839
want you to notice okay they've got a term equated with an artisan who let's

00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:48.240
just want you to notice that you get a taste for where the culture is right now

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:54.079
where did they get their word Craftsman oh okay so wait a minute this

00:39:54.079 --> 00:40:00.480
is a name it's actually a proper name right um it's not based upon the action

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.720
of a Craftsman um has nothing to do with the history of the Craftsman it's it's a

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:13.000
name maybe there were a family of Craftsmen okay so you can see that that

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.119
the derivation of that word is kind of questionable questionable at

00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:24.520
best right and you'll find that a lot in the Hebrew translation of the septu

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:30.880
agent you'll find that the more you go and do your lexical work you'll find

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:36.880
they don't really know what this word means right and if you only have 8,000

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:44.800
unique words that's a huge problem you mean you got a percentage of those words that um you know we thank we think we

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:52.119
understand but yeah no it's a bad it's a bad place to be so um you know hey

00:40:52.119 --> 00:41:00.240
languages just aren't aren't born equal that's the way it is some of them dominate and some of them didn't okay

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:07.920
let's go to the next one isn't it language beautiful though okay what what else are we looking for we're as Jehovah

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:13.480
is going to be taken out of the world world he's going to be taken that

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:18.680
Craftsman he's going to be taking that wise Craftsman and he's also going to be

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:25.640
taking the knowing Acro what is an arrotin next one please next one please

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:32.440
what is he going to be taking he's going to be taking these away now what is this

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:37.760
it's a person who hears are you ready this is really

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:44.000
native Greek right really native Greek um yeah and when I say that I just have

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.560
to mention by the way there was a

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:57.880
language discovered in Northern turkey that is descendant from

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:06.200
the Greek of helenistic Greece they still speak it they don't

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:11.800
have anything recorded of it but they still speak it and what's funny it as

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:17.880
I've been telling you modern Greek is nothing is nothing

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:25.319
close okay don't fool yourself um it's not um I worked with modern Greek

00:42:25.319 --> 00:42:30.640
students in classics right and they would be the first to

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:36.400
tell you it's a you know it's a whole different ball game yeah um but this

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:41.760
language they just discovered in Northern turkey it is um you know a

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:47.680
sister language to the helenistic Greece uh Greek and they gave a couple of

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:55.800
examples grammatically how it is some uses of infinitives and what not I thought that was nice elegant um and uh

00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:04.280
the funny thing was in the article they said and it's jly unrelated to Modern Greek like there's no there's no overlap

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:09.760
whatsoever um I thought that was I thought that was you know um telling I'm

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:14.839
sorry modern modern Greek I'm sorry is a language I'm sorry but that's what

00:43:14.839 --> 00:43:20.760
happens when you take a 14-year-old and put her in a habit and put her into a

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:26.720
prison where she's not allowed to bloom that's what happens um linguistically

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:34.280
that's what happens okay let's get back on it speaking linguistic League next one let's go these people want their

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:42.160
values worth I said I was going to ruffle some feathers um look at this what is the word for it um Whispering or

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:47.839
charming Whispering or charming what is that hearer is that really a whisper or

00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:56.400
charmer go back to the last one boom look people look at the second line in a

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:03.319
a discip and a pupil right a disciple or a pupil

00:44:03.319 --> 00:44:10.240
and my goodness look at Roman numeral number two a reader are you kidding me a

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:15.640
reader okay so this is one of the things they're going to be taking away this is

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:21.319
not something that the Hebrew was able to recognize so the Hebrew used instead

00:44:21.319 --> 00:44:30.480
a whispering or a Charming as a noun okay not the same thing definitely

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:36.599
not the same thing go to the next one um we're starting to degrade here now watch it's going to get worse look at and I'll

00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:42.640
hurry up here because I know oh we've got 10 minutes um my

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:50.839
people my people what the prores are taking everything from you

00:44:50.839 --> 00:44:58.040
the proas are taking everything from it yes and what's worse is the aun

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:05.240
these are the people who are ruling you says Isaiah now what are what's a

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:13.079
what is it who are prores let's see let's see yeah who are prores right um

00:45:13.079 --> 00:45:21.680
they officials who execute a judgment for debt okay again highly specific

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:27.119
word this is a a societal position a

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:34.960
Civic position if you will right somebody who's coming to collect a debt right looks like taxes

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:41.200
are also involved okay give me the next one um wh go back to that one how does

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:46.920
the Hebrew handle this um okay as for my

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:54.079
people their oppressors our children wait are we is

00:45:54.079 --> 00:46:02.160
this the same line yes it's the same line and women rule over them wait a minute that wasn't any of the Greek

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:07.480
what's happening here there's going to be no word for this position because

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:15.400
there wasn't that position when Hebrew was around to be able to assimilate it

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:22.839
so they didn't have it so what do you use you use something general like oppressor

00:46:22.839 --> 00:46:28.839
oppressor well okay where are you getting the children go back to the Greek verse where are they getting the

00:46:28.839 --> 00:46:35.559
children you know my people the those who control the retrieval of debts

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:42.000
they're going to be all over you and who are going to rule over you the

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:50.680
ayunes give me the next one boom yeah here we go what what is it to

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:57.079
aai it's to demand something back right to to to get something to be returned

00:46:57.079 --> 00:47:02.760
eared right okay um look at it in the passive I think this is neat to be

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:08.880
demanded in payment to be demanded in payment okay

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:14.839
so these are people who the people not only are they going to come to collect their

00:47:14.839 --> 00:47:21.119
debts right that you've got with them but they are also going to show up and be all

00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:27.280
mouthy yeah yeah oh my goodness this is terrible

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:34.480
news right let's see um I still don't see the Hebrew was way off what's the Hebrew and it said oh these are the

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:41.480
people okay the mouthy are these people

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:47.640
women how is a translator remember now the story is in this letter of aristeus

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:55.040
that Yahoo blessed this event of translating from the Hebrew to the Greek

00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:04.960
so for some reason when they went from from the Hebrew woman yeah they got to an

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:12.640
oppressor who comes and takes away your furniture while yelling at

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:19.960
you okay um this is not a good translation you cannot go from a lower

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:25.640
level of technical expertise linguistically to a higher you can't do

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:32.119
it yeah you can only reach the equivalent or

00:48:32.119 --> 00:48:40.119
less and if you don't have a highly technical language you aren't going up that ladder you only have 8,000 words

00:48:40.119 --> 00:48:46.400
Hebrew you had your guts beaten Out of You by ancient Greek man that dominated

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:51.559
the world don't worry they they even went over and gave it to those UT dwelling

00:48:51.559 --> 00:49:00.079
Romans oh God you know what Marcus aelius red he read Greek he wrote in

00:49:00.079 --> 00:49:05.599
Greek and he was the Roman Emperor why would he do

00:49:05.599 --> 00:49:13.520
that because number one he was on drugs and the drugs were making him

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:19.520
smarter and the creek was a necessary component it was a catalyst that just

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:27.200
made the whole reaction take off yeah oh God bunch of druggies it's

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:34.960
amazing history I love it I love it but you know nobody wants to see the dirty stuff

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:41.160
you do my congregation okay look Gnostic is like hurry hurry up all right let's

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:47.359
go um look verse 13 yeah okay now look here I just wanted to show you something

00:49:47.359 --> 00:49:52.720
that's colloquial and that it's colloquial in Greek not in Hebrew so um

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:59.000
verse 13 says and now the cuos is established a

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:06.760
judgment he brought a judgment upon the people okay and it's using a verb

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:12.480
cath right which is based upon the concept of standing but it's been

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:18.359
augmented by the cth to become establish to

00:50:18.359 --> 00:50:24.640
ground right to ready something yeah and this is what the what

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:30.240
the Hebrew do with that oh it's terrible this this is a Slaughter turn away for those of you who have weak linguistic

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:38.040
stomachs blow it blow it up blow it up he stands up oh God there's Yahoo now

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:44.319
look at Yahoo you can't tell that it's written that way could be Yahoo too okay

00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:50.160
so don't get mad at me when I say Yahoo thank

00:50:50.359 --> 00:50:57.160
you and by the way they use different ways to translate for for Yahweh

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:04.359
right Hashim right they use different ways of Translating that from one Greek term so

00:51:04.359 --> 00:51:10.280
why why would they do that thing because they're composing it in the thir century and they're trying to split they're

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:16.160
trying to create their own identity right you can't just list what

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:21.400
the it's looks like Greek they probably said as they were trying to figure it out they probably draft one they were

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:28.240
like no way that is way too transparently Greek

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:33.480
right love it LOL amond is the man I love that thank you that was a good one

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:38.520
don't put any of the bad ones up no all right unless I'm going to hell let's go

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:46.000
to one more uh uh keep going down where wherever we were from last time

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:52.799
yeah are we on the right okay um yeah the SC he's going to take this away too

00:51:52.799 --> 00:52:01.160
oh we got to go back up we missed a couple here hang on people I'm sorry I apologize I have messed up my order here

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:08.960
okay there we go what was the translation of that passage the translation is the Lord stands

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:19.000
up no it's a Greek idiom um establishing Justice right is to um rule yeah is to

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.119
bring that authority to literally establish that Authority so there's no

00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:31.599
um there's no standing up there's there's no actual standing up yeah um otherwise the Greeks wouldn't use that

00:52:31.599 --> 00:52:38.839
idiom right they could just say that the Lord stood up right what you can see is

00:52:38.839 --> 00:52:45.079
the attempt of the rabbis to draw down the more sophisticated or

00:52:45.079 --> 00:52:52.119
complex um Greek into the limited capacity Hebrew um unfortunate it's an

00:52:52.119 --> 00:53:02.359
unfortunate e linguistic exercise let's go to that one good look at this people verse 17 and God watch this yeah yeah

00:53:02.359 --> 00:53:10.559
God's going to do what he's he's going to humiliate those Daughters of Zion who

00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:17.720
rule wait what what who's ruling who are these

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:22.880
women I'm starting to like this a little bit better and Kio

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:28.839
apocal and the lord they're may put Yahweh there they may not it's whatever

00:53:28.839 --> 00:53:35.280
the particular circumstances were Kus and the cus did what he's gonna do what

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:40.960
he's G he's going to apocalypse he's goingon to reveal what's he gonna reveal

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:48.400
he's going to reveal their scha he's going to reveal the schema of

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:55.000
these Daughters of Zion who are ruling and you say what is this

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.200
scha what is he going a reveal of theirs now watch this it gets dirty it's the

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:06.440
Hebrew that makes it dirty not me go ahead what is a schma in Greek it's a

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:13.319
form it's a form of something right a shape they have look at be it's an atom

00:54:13.319 --> 00:54:20.079
yeah it's the appearance of something as opposed to the reality the appearance of something and

00:54:20.079 --> 00:54:28.920
then look down at B it's the dress or equipment do you know what he's going to do he's going to take away all that fine

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:36.200
dress and Equipment of those ruling women now let's see what the Hebrew

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:41.680
let's see what the Hebrew made of that do we get it through the message come

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:48.599
through here we go are you ready what therefore he will strike with a

00:54:48.599 --> 00:54:55.040
scab now I I know that that first part of the Hebrew there is just the word and

00:54:55.040 --> 00:55:02.160
I don't know where they're pulling the therefore out of there if you can even do that with with W I don't know yeah

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:09.920
but they okay wait so look they used adoni

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:16.480
here so they really don't know how to use that uh Greek word properly and

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:21.960
they're cramming all of these Gods into it okay just wait just wait maybe they

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:27.319
felt good because of Adonis I don't know but the the Lord is going to strike with

00:55:27.319 --> 00:55:32.880
a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of oh there he is

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:38.000
Yahoo right and what is he gonna do look at the second line he's gonna uncover

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:45.000
their secret Parts dirty that's what is going on in the

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:52.640
mind of that author because that's not from the Greek my goodness close your eyes chewy

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:59.839
the Bible is dirty it's dirty stuff and first of all why would he do that like

00:55:59.839 --> 00:56:06.640
seriously right um the Greek makes sense it says he's going to take away their

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:14.119
kit their dress their Jewels he's going to take all of that away it's nothing about

00:56:14.119 --> 00:56:19.599
their private parts is in there right now if this is as they want you to

00:56:19.599 --> 00:56:26.640
believe as seminaries would have you believe as religious training would have

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:32.760
you believe in whichever the monotheist religions you want that don't worship

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:40.760
the Gods like the rest of us right um they're going to have um

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:46.520
this as a background they're telling you the Hebrew is being transl is being

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:52.960
translated by the Greek the Greek is the new copy right that's the original

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:59.960
language now somehow if that says in Hebrew but the private parts of these

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:07.319
women who are ruling right he's going to uncover that um the translator had to go

00:57:07.319 --> 00:57:13.400
from private parts to schema which has nothing to do with private parts so

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:19.000
either it's a bad translation and Yahoo was bad because remember Yahoo blessed

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:26.599
this thing and um it was magically turned out to be everybody wrote the same translation of these 72 guys right

00:57:26.599 --> 00:57:32.720
so either he's a bad translator or more realistically the language is just

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:38.799
incapable of conveying um the original Greek that's just the way it is watch

00:57:38.799 --> 00:57:46.559
it's going to get watch these technical terms I'm going to throw you give me the next one yeah um yeah and so what is the what

00:57:46.559 --> 00:57:52.720
is your English translation for so for everybody sitting in synagogue or church sitting there and you're reading through

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:58.960
blah blah blah therefore the Lord will Smite with a scab on the crown of the head that's not there the daughters of

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:05.400
Zion you'll be like oh that's a nasty thing to do right and the Lord will discover their secret Parts Look it's

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:10.760
even discover because you can tell the King James or whoever it was that

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:17.079
translated this was a little bit uncomfortable with the whole private parts business right where is the chorus

00:58:17.079 --> 00:58:23.520
where is the chorus of my sisters of frustration where are you I can't hear

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:30.039

00:59:18.799 --> 00:59:24.480
just going to show you with this passage for example this is Verse 18 so this is Isaiah

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.640
3:18 yeah um in that day it says the

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:37.680
Lord is going to take away the glory of the htis and long story short that is the

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:43.960
way that one dresses right and what else is he going to take away to

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:51.359
Cosmos um you refer the cosmos as the woman's makeup kit yeah yeah so it can

00:59:51.359 --> 00:59:56.520
include jewelry it's not just the drugs that they're putting on their faces

00:59:56.520 --> 01:00:02.359
right skin drugs all sorts of drugs all over the place right including those

01:00:02.359 --> 01:00:07.440
drugs that control reproduction right even those you put

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:14.160
those in there right this is you know this is your life's Pharmacy kit um

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:19.480
that's the cosmos it's that order that order and so this is what he's going to

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:27.079
fight against he's going to take away your hair dues right he's going to take away your hair nets and long story short

01:00:27.079 --> 01:00:32.559
none of these terms are captured U give me the next one we have a it's terrible

01:00:32.559 --> 01:00:38.440
the translation gets terrible and I just want to jump oh these are all Athenian

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:43.520
too I want you to realize these are all Athenian terms again placing the

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:49.079
language squarely fifth fourth thir centuries good good good give me that

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:56.119
I'm going to fly watch this um these are just things that are there that it's hard for us to be able to capture um and

01:00:56.119 --> 01:01:03.760
they have to do with uh this little here I'm going to jump ahead to is it this

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:11.160
one look at this did I did I totally overdo it or what um what else is what

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:16.359
else is the Lord here's the punch line people what else is the Lord going to

01:01:16.359 --> 01:01:23.599
take away he's going to take away the per porur the pett porur yeah and what else

01:01:23.599 --> 01:01:28.880
is the Lord going to take away the Lord's going to take away

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:36.079
tesur are you kidding um these are terms um Everybody saw this is the first term

01:01:36.079 --> 01:01:42.119
that comes up in the library the end of that word p porur that's the first word

01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:47.920
of The Great herculanum Library for the future historians The Great herculanum

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:55.400
Library the very first word that comes out is that purple right and we've got it here in

01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:03.119
the text not only that we we going to attack something else on the front of it meso the mesop porur and tell me what is

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:09.599
the Hebrew translate those as blow it up what does the Hebrew translate those as

01:02:09.599 --> 01:02:17.799
the Rings and The Jewels with the word nose tagged on wait the Rings and the nose

01:02:17.799 --> 01:02:23.960
Jewels are you kidding me are you kidding

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:29.039
me do you see what happened in there they just that's a guess bro whoever

01:02:29.039 --> 01:02:34.440
made that translation was downright guessing now here's the problem the

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:39.520
Greek actually matches with the whole context because he's attacking these

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:44.920
women right who are priestesses and he's attacking their validity and he's going

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:50.119
to take away all of their wardrobe

01:02:50.119 --> 01:02:57.599
yeah yeah uhhuh nice gorgeous and that purple is

01:02:57.599 --> 01:03:04.279
part of it you know what those purple words are they're different terms for

01:03:04.279 --> 01:03:10.640
using that gorgeous material stained with the

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:18.119
purple oh God he's going to take that away but no the Hebrew comes along and

01:03:18.119 --> 01:03:23.359
says no you must be rings and nose Jewels because everybody

01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:29.760
knows you need the Rings and the nose Jewels yeah why did they do that that's

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:35.079
I'll never know that'll be that's a mystery of our history right there right

01:03:35.079 --> 01:03:42.319
there they didn't want the purple they wanted jewels okay okay so you can see people

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:49.960
that um the story The Narrative of this being translated um into Greek from the Hebrew

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:56.520
is completely made up you would have to be completely stoned and just in venting

01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:04.400
things to make I don't know the story better wow wow okay let's go I'm gonna

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:12.400
pull one out this is the last one Neil and I'm coming I'm coming are you ready for this this is um boom I was going to

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:17.599
take you all through the purple but instead I'm going to end with this one

01:04:17.599 --> 01:04:25.119
um no this is more the same this is now darn it um there we are here take down

01:04:25.119 --> 01:04:35.400
the and initiating people I love this oh I get so excited I'm about to burst are you ready look at it verse 22

01:04:41.799 --> 01:04:48.359
Kai oh isn't that isn't that gorgeous isn't that gorgeous laon you see that

01:04:48.359 --> 01:04:54.880
word before the letter before the end of the verse um Capital Lambda on the front

01:04:54.880 --> 01:05:03.279
of it um those those of you who recognize the Greek now will see that that's laconian wait what does it say it

01:05:03.279 --> 01:05:08.559
says that cios is going to take from you those things remember we're talking

01:05:08.559 --> 01:05:14.760
about their wardrobe those things that you put on it's your home in your

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:20.559
privacy and what are those things one of them is a

01:05:20.559 --> 01:05:27.640
laconian seethrough a diaphanous laconian

01:05:28.119 --> 01:05:36.720
night gown that's what curios is g to take

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:42.119
from you now wait a minute you mean in the Bible it refers to the

01:05:42.119 --> 01:05:48.599
Spartans yeah it does because remember this is being written in the 3

01:05:48.599 --> 01:05:56.160
Century right there's nothing novel about the laconians then yeah oh

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:01.599
wow wow why is Isaiah who supposedly is

01:06:01.599 --> 01:06:07.200
way back why is centuries earlier why is he writing about the

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:14.760
laconians that's interesting let's see what the Hebrew does with it because now this is a problem this is a problem this

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:22.760
is not only a linguistic problem because you can't represent that in Hebrew but um it looks bad culturally a lot of the

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:28.760
changes that are made from the original Greek the septu agent to the Hebrew have

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:35.960
to do with control of content that's what people always want

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:41.640
when they rewrite they want control of content and you guys know how it works

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:47.440
where we worship The Muse nobody controls content you don't make your

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.839
soup here this is a pure stream you're all

01:06:52.839 --> 01:06:59.119
gone yeah oh God love that what does the Hebrew do with the laconian let's just

01:06:59.119 --> 01:07:04.559
show this because I know Neil's going to love this open it up open it up um okay

01:07:04.559 --> 01:07:12.000
what the fesal apparel and the mantels and the outer garments and the

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.160
purses wait what were we looking for chewy there was something big there there there was laconians there's

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:26.720
Spartans where' the Spartans go they cut out the Spartans they cut out the Spartans

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:32.160
okay now what they would have you believe is

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:37.680
that you don't have

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:46.319
Spartans but the translation does because God is

01:07:46.319 --> 01:07:51.599
perfect yeah yeah I don't know looks like God could have gotten better

01:07:51.599 --> 01:07:56.640
linguists to be honest yeah

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:02.119
that's terrible that's terrible you guys blew it you those I'm talking you know

01:08:02.119 --> 01:08:07.880
who I'm talking to I'm talking to the goofballs who started to came up with

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:15.920
the idea of writing this fake letter of aristas and saying look this great

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:21.440
person asked the king and the King was like yes I need a

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:26.920
translation yes no they didn't they didn't care right

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:32.120
now the person who came up with that load the load of the history of septan

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:37.640
because what that did was that load compelled Christianity

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:45.480
forward it established a legitimacy that was strong enough to dissolve classical

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:50.920
wisdom yeah it's like a some kind of acid ate right through

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:56.758
it yeah what you're watching is the

01:08:56.759 --> 01:09:02.798
monad take out everybody else because that's what it does that's what

01:09:02.799 --> 01:09:09.838
monotheism does it doesn't matter what color or taste or variety it is

01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:16.400
monotheism kills classical civilization the civilization that

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:24.440
brought you democracy and the scientific method that Civilization

01:09:26.719 --> 01:09:33.199
Christianity Judaism Islam and that stuff they worshiped around

01:09:33.199 --> 01:09:43.560
aanat that stuff kills classical wisdom yes it does it does so um when

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:51.719
the libraries start getting burned that's when you know your temperature is too high and your proportion of radicals

01:09:51.719 --> 01:09:58.440
is way too high right every 150 years just to bring in just the

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:07.360
present for a second every 150 years says Tom someone is going to try to pull down

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:15.920
the government the established government yeah yeah and who is it

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:21.159
typically I had somebody ask me this week can't you combine Christianity to

01:10:21.159 --> 01:10:29.000
include everyone can't you combine Christianity and the Abra abrahamic faiths can't you combine those to

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000
welcome them Julian Who We Now call Julian the

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:41.520
apostate Julian the last Pagan

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:47.560
Emperor said they're going to do it again they're going to burn us down just

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:53.960
like they did in the first yeah just like they

01:10:53.960 --> 01:11:01.080
did it's the mission of monotheism to dominate and

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:06.480
Destroy it's the mission how's it coming the Watchers are watching by the way did

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:14.159
you see we had Giants and we didn't have Nephilim flying around right no those are just prominent people thank you for

01:11:14.159 --> 01:11:21.320
coming tonight I am going to now give you an added bonus I am going to hand

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:30.080
over the stage to gnostic informant and before Gnostic informant starts

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:38.280
speaking I just want to let you know that um his Source workor has been

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:45.880
absolutely dazzling yeah and I told them I told them Neil I told them that you uh

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:52.080
purchased and are using all of the loes yeah and you are eating up you're trying

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:59.400
to consume like some kind of artificial intelligence or something you're like trying to consume everything so you have

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:04.639
a great you have a great offering right now and it's about some stuff that I

01:12:04.639 --> 01:12:10.199
don't know and I'm gonna have to listen to your Authority okay yeah man thanks

01:12:10.199 --> 01:12:17.560
for having me go for it thanks for having me on dude and uh um that was some interesting stuff that I've just

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:23.080
now hearing about the linguistic side to this because I don't have no I don't know anything about the Linguistics I

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:28.679
have no uh I I I don't have the knowledge of

01:12:28.679 --> 01:12:34.159
linguistics to be able to say who's translating from what but those are some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slam dunk points that I just

01:12:34.159 --> 01:12:39.800
heard right there so I'm gonna have to look into all that that's amazing I want to look at the Historical

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:46.199
side of this where's the evidence of a big

01:12:46.199 --> 01:12:52.920
literary um era of all these prophets and writers and scribes and like we we

01:12:52.920 --> 01:13:00.320
have prophets writing these long texts that are you know about all these prophecies and events that are happening

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:06.040
and politics and all this so you would expect if you're writing these who you're writing to an audience right

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:13.159
you're writing to somebody you're not just writing to nobody so you would expect people citing these Texs you

01:13:13.159 --> 01:13:21.960
would expect there to be like a chain of reactions to these TXS people talking back and forth something anything well

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:29.159
we don't get that so let me just say this I'm going to start with what is what are other people saying about the

01:13:29.159 --> 01:13:38.280
origins of Israel and the last time I was here we had on um we were we ended up on we're

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:44.800
talking about tac's story about the history of the Hebrews and it was it's a

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:51.800
it's a story that's only in a couple of sources I think Plutarch talks about it Mano and then hecas

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:58.199
vder his story seems to line up with this story it's a alternate account and

01:13:58.199 --> 01:14:03.920
I looked into some of this stuff and see is does this hold any water so let's I'm going to pull up a source from

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:10.159
lobe I love this website too this is such this is amazing stuff let me see it let me make sure this is big enough for

01:14:10.159 --> 01:14:16.639
everybody how's that there we go um actually let me back that up one there

01:14:16.639 --> 01:14:22.440
we go all right so tacitus is telling this story in the early 2nd Century

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:27.800
about who are these Jews we don't really know much about this is you know they're kind of they're kind of late on the

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:33.719
scene as far as uh ancient civilizations go as far as the Egyptians the Greeks

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:41.040
Punic Phoenicians carthaginians we all know those people there they're in every text we could find hundreds of people

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:46.360
mentioning Carthage people mentioning Phoenicians people mentioning the Egyptians people mentioning the ionians

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:54.280
people mentioning the blasians people mentioning the cians they're all over the place in these sources but nobody

01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:00.760
ever mentions the Jews until well okay there's a couple of

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:07.480
rocks that people have found that mention certain Kings like omry very very little bit like little

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:14.679
citystate so the evidence looks like there's a little citystate kingdom going on in Jerusalem and in jezrael other

01:15:14.679 --> 01:15:20.040
than that no one's writing about these people so what so what's going on here so let's read this what read this story

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:27.480
and I'm just going to go I got a lot of things that I want to go through but it's all going to come back to what I'm almost saying all right so he says at

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:33.159
the beginning of this of the same year Titus Caesar who had selected by his father to complete the sub subjugation

01:15:33.159 --> 01:15:39.360
Judea he's basically saying like we just subjugated this this place Judea um

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:45.000
let's let's go through the history so he says uh so this is what he

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:53.080
says it is said that the Jews were originally Exiles from the island of cre who settled in the farthest parts of

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:59.679
Libya at the time when Saturn had been deposed and expelled by Joe an argument

01:15:59.679 --> 01:16:06.760
for this is derived in the name there is a famous mountain in Creek called Ida hence the inhabitants were called idea

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:13.040
which is L lengthened in the barbarous form udah all right uh some hold that the

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.760
reign of Isis is superflous the population of Egypt under the leadership of

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:25.120
hosis which is in Greek means holy minded It's a a name in Greek it's interesting you never hear about that

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:32.560
like where what's what does Jerusalem mean well here's one atmology given by tesus it's a named after a king named

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:39.199
here slimus and UDA discharged itself on the neighboring lands and many others

01:16:39.199 --> 01:16:44.560
you gotta you got to think where is he getting this from is would he make is this something someone just make up just

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:51.840
keep that in the back of your mind all right still others report that they were Assyrian refugees landless people who

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:59.120
first got control of a part of Egypt possibly maybe a little bit of both maybe the so I when I read this my I'm

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:05.000
thinking the evidence shows the Philistines have there's evidence that the Philistines did come from

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:11.120
CRE and this the Assyrian refugees thing sort of matches up with these people

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:16.239
coming together in this area called Canaan so I'm going to keep continue

01:17:16.239 --> 01:17:21.400
with this part this is this is where it gets crazy most authors agree that once

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:29.120
during a plague in Egypt which caused bodily disfigurement King bakaras approached the Oracle of Ammon

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:36.360
I'm gonna get to who this is in a minute just give me a second king bakus approached the Oracle of

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:42.600
Ammon ask for a remedy whereupon he was told wait am I still on the same page

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:48.159
okay good ask for a remedy where he was told to purge his kingdom and transport

01:17:48.159 --> 01:17:55.360
this race into other lands since it was hateful to the gods so the Hebrews were searched out and gathered together

01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:04.040
then being abandoned in the desert while all others lay idle and weeping one only of the Exiles Moses by

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:09.639
name warned them not to hope for help from the gods or men for they were

01:18:09.639 --> 01:18:15.920
deserted by both but the trust to themselves regarding as a guide Sent

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:21.280
From Heaven the one whose assistance should first give them escape from their

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:29.480
present distress so he's basically saying um he's basically saying whatever the

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:35.560
sign whatever sign we get from Heaven that's going to be our God that's what we're gonna that's gonna we're gonna

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:43.639
look for a sign from Heaven to find a new go a new God because the Egyptian Almon does not like us they agreed and

01:18:43.639 --> 01:18:50.480
they set out on their journey in utter ignorance but trusting to chance nothing caused them so much distress as scarcity

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:56.360
of water and in fact they had already fallen EX exhausted over the plain nigh

01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:02.920
unto death when a herd of wild asses moved from their pasturage to a rock

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:08.560
that was shaded by a Grove of trees Moses followed them and conjecturing the

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:13.880
truth from the grassy ground discovered abundant streams of water this relieved

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:21.800
them and they marched six days continuously on the seventh seized a country expelling the former inhabitants

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:28.560
and there they founded a Temple dedicated a temple so to establish his influence over his

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:35.280
people Moses introduced a new religious practices quite opposed to those of all other religions the Jews regard as

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:41.600
profane all that we hold sacred on the other hand they permit all that we abore

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:47.080
they dedicated in a shrine a statue of that creature whose guidance enabled

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:52.560
them to put an end to their waterings and thirst a statue of a donkey

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:58.320
sacrificing a ram in D of Ammon they likewise abstain from the

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:03.760
ox because the Egyptians worship all right that's a little story he gives there's more on this too but I'm not

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:09.800
gonna keep keep going I just wanted to show that part he gives this alternate origin story that

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:16.560
doesn't it sounds like an exodus a little bit you got Moses you got them wandering in the desert but there's a

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:22.040
lot of different things happening here and we have a name of the Pharaoh now we didn't get the name of the Pharaoh in

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:29.080
the Bible they don't say they they never say people say ramsy doesn't say ramies ever there's no name it just says

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:36.800
Pharaoh so in this text we actually get a name so if we look at who is

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:44.600
bakaras here he is bachan reth also known in Greek as bakaras he's from the

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:49.920
24th Dynasty all right well how do we know that how do I'm just to I mean we

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:58.560
can just trust Wikipedia But I want to show you how we know that so I'm going to go to alien or no man let's go to

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:06.639
mano Mano mentions this bakus the 24th Dynasty reigned for 44 years and in his

01:21:06.639 --> 01:21:12.120
Reign a lamb spoke what turns out that this was like

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:17.360
some sort of event that happened where a lamb told the Egyptians that they would

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:24.120
be conquered by the Assyrians and then okay who hases anyone else corroborate this evidence alien talks about this too

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:30.840
this is another the Roman writer here's writing in Greek as you can see the Egyptians assert that they are far from

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:37.920
convincing me they assert that I say in the days of the far Fame bachus a lamb was born with eight feet and two tails

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:43.760
and that it spoke they say that the lamb had two heads and four horns

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:50.320
what so wait a minute now we're looking at where does all this all these

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:56.280
Prophecies of all these animals with multiple heads and horns giving telling the the people they're going to be

01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:04.679
sacked and taken over by the Babylonians and Assyrians well here's a here's another here's another H source for that

01:22:04.679 --> 01:22:11.760
but here's the problem with this King bakus as I've shown you King

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:21.600
bakaras is is this is only in the e8th century BC this is not Bronze Age 18th Dynasty

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:27.199
that we're talking about this is we're almost almost in The Classical

01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:33.920
period I mean we're we're this is we're getting towards the Persian period now we're getting towards the Greek

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:39.639
helenistic period so this is what this this is who this king is all right let's

01:22:39.639 --> 01:22:46.920
continue let's let's see what else we got um so I want to go to Herodotus real

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:53.239
quick I want to talk about the alphabet for a second Herodotus

01:22:53.239 --> 01:22:58.719
says that this is

01:22:58.719 --> 01:23:04.719
the this one the uh the

01:23:04.719 --> 01:23:11.719
Phoenicians so okay Herodotus Herodotus mentions in in his uh in his Persian

01:23:11.719 --> 01:23:18.920
Wars that the uh alphabet comes from the Phoenicians but he says something

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:26.440
interesting about I think I don't think I even have the source here it's in the I'm the wrong page um I could put I could look it up

01:23:30.719 --> 01:23:38.520
alphabet here it is he says the Phoenicians who came with

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:44.760
Cadmus by the way Cadmus was the King of Thieves he is a Phoenician by descent

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:51.360
but he's living up in thieves in Greece and it says at their settlement in this country among many others of learning

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:58.560
brought into H us the alphabet which had hitherto been unknown as I think to the Greeks and presently

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:05.520
as the time went on the sound in the form of the letters changed at this time the Greeks that dwelt around them from

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:12.440
from most parts were ionians all right who have been taught the letters by the Phoenicians and used

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:19.920
them with some few changes in form this is I'm G show you some crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right here ready um thus the

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:25.880
ionians have from ancient times called Papyrus sheet skins but formerly lack

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:32.400
Papyrus they use the skins of sheep goats uh let me see where's the part that I here it is I myself have seen

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:39.560
cian characters in the temple of ish of isian

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:46.239
Apollo so he's saying that the oldest alphabet that ever existed is up in the

01:24:46.239 --> 01:24:52.800
temple of Apollo in boia which is near Athens Graven on a certain tripods and

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:58.760
for the most part like the ionian characters that's really strange now

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:05.880
this this because the the the idea of Phoenicians making an alphabet and then

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:11.360
giving it to the Greeks it's a little more it's not as black and white as people think it is there's some there's

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:17.560
more going on here and Herodotus kind of gives a little clue on this so let's look at this right all right I want to

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:23.440
show I want to show you guys something this is this is going to be cool I promise I'm going to share a different

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:29.679
screen for a second um this right

01:25:29.679 --> 01:25:36.480
here here we go what I'm about to show you is

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:45.159
called it is called the dispill tablet you see

01:25:45.159 --> 01:25:50.280
this this is a ancient tablet it's a

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:56.000
mystery right now they was discovered like 30 years ago in Macedonia which is

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.280
where the pans used to live thce Macedonia thesy that's palasan land oh

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:08.400
and and also in Turkey where Troy is modern day Turkey you know um that's

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:13.639
that's where the palasan are from that whole region that's all palasan that's

01:26:13.639 --> 01:26:19.719
the palasan so right in the heart of the palasan land is this thing that they

01:26:19.719 --> 01:26:25.440
discovered it's like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what is this now if you look that looks like an AA

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:30.600
that looks like a dollet down there looks like you got now this one blew my

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:36.239
mind because this looks like it could be either a dma which is an ancient form of

01:26:36.239 --> 01:26:44.159
a d of a w sound but it also looks like an Omega which is the it looks like it

01:26:44.159 --> 01:26:54.000
you can see like all I'm saying is looking at these characters you can almost imagine an older descendant of

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:02.000
what becomes both the Greek and Phoenician alphabets all right let's continue on this how much um evidence do

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.480
I have right let's what do we got here so I'm going to share my screen again

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:12.679
and this time I'm G to share well I'll just go to the same

01:27:12.679 --> 01:27:17.800
um let's go to this page again all right sharing my

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:26.119
screen all right so this let's just let's look into this tablet what is this thing this is what the uh

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:38.199
all right um we'll get him back here just a second here we I I hate when that

01:27:38.199 --> 01:27:45.400
happens when you click on something and it gives you the wrong screen I hate when that all right here we go I'm brought I brought it back up all right

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:50.440
so let's go to all right now this time it would shouldn't do that again so I I

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:56.360
want to look into this now this is what the this is what the article says a apparently now there's been no academic

01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:03.600
articles written on this tablet yet it's a mystery people are starting to figure out what the hell is this thing because

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:10.159
this is gonna if this really is all right let me let's just talk about it first apparently this wooden tablet

01:28:10.159 --> 01:28:15.480
bearing what looks like an early form of an alphabet carbon dates they did carbon

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:22.480
dating on it because it's wood so they can carbon date it 5,000 BC right now it doesn't necessarily mean

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:27.920
the writing is the 5,000 BC someone could incription but so far that's all we

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:34.520
know the the carbon dating came back it's from 5000 BC it's discovered 1993

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:40.800
and the but here's the here's the here's the crazy part that I this is why I wanted to bring this up this is the

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:47.560
crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right here it's discover the place they found it in was a Neolithic

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:53.560
Village which means like like wrap your head around this like I'm you got I'm

01:28:53.560 --> 01:29:01.119
you have to understand what I'm saying here the village that they uncovered very very far underground is all

01:29:01.119 --> 01:29:07.840
Neolithic stuff the pottery the town the building everything and then this is

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:13.840
there how did that get there and it's carbon dating matches too every it's all

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:20.280
it fits with the Neolithic except for the writing on it which is like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going why

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:27.920
is there it looks like kind of like a Greek form of alphabet in a Neolithic

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:33.480
Foundation put that screen up if you if you don't mind just want to sh I just want to show

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:39.080
um so okay University the tablet discover is announced at a symposium in

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:44.280
February 1994 at the University of thessalonica um the site's paleo

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:49.920
environment boty fishing techniques tools and Ceramics were described informally in a me okay that's that's

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:55.800
that's something uh all right so basically I just all we know so far is

01:29:55.800 --> 01:30:01.400
they dug up this Neolithic place and this is this is work being

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:07.159
done by the Aristotle's University at thessalonica and there there right now someone's writing there's apparently I

01:30:07.159 --> 01:30:13.360
looked into it there is being there's articles being there's academic articles being written on this thing that might

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:19.639
change the the consensus on the alphabet I'm not kidding I WR look look this up for yourself please look this up don't

01:30:19.639 --> 01:30:25.159
listen to me but there are people saying that the articles being written about

01:30:25.159 --> 01:30:31.719
this tablet is going to change the academic consensus on the on the invention of the alphabet now let me

01:30:31.719 --> 01:30:37.119
continue with this um I want to show because let's the the first question

01:30:37.119 --> 01:30:45.480
should be does the evidence is there any other evidence for anything like this is this just by itself right I want to give

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:51.239
you some I want to give you I'm GNA give you an example of something that's by itself that makes that doesn't fit the

01:30:51.239 --> 01:30:58.239
mereta Stelly doesn't fit at all with any of the evidence but it's accepted because there's a Dogma in mainstream

01:30:58.239 --> 01:31:03.840
Academia that wants Israel to be like real it's like they want the fairy tale

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:09.480
to be real hold that thought put a little side note on that let's go but here's the thing it turns out that

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:12.840
they're actually is

01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:20.800
a and another asteroid sorry about that this is getting exciting man I'm I'm

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:25.960
about to lose it look I did song and dance I song dance okay you're on go all

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:32.040
right all right here we go so here's here's What's called the Trojan

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:39.080
script so it turns out there actually is some other basis of what this means okay the

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:44.520
troan script is look at this it almost

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:50.280
obviously it's not Greek but you look at it you look at the characters and don't got you don't got to use your

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:55.760
imagination too hard and you're like okay there's some it's not like

01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:02.119
hieroglyphics it's it's very syllabic it's very uh you know so okay so let's

01:32:02.119 --> 01:32:09.679
talk about this what what's going on here Phil Phil uh Phil um philus philus

01:32:09.679 --> 01:32:16.560
I I think that's the same as um as philologist probably uh attempted to transliterate the science as

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:24.840
Greek Professor hog attempted to translate it the seal he claims that the words are TA ego POG believe this meant

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:30.440
Divine Sego so Scholars are already guessing this is some protog Greek stuff

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:37.440
going on here right and by the way people are shutting trying to shut this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:42.639
down AO like the the the mainstream consensus is like no way no way no way

01:32:42.639 --> 01:32:47.679
no way no way no way but some of these some of these philologists are saying

01:32:47.679 --> 01:32:54.560
what else can it be and so there's A's a huge debate going on about this I'm not going to sit here and say it's GRE

01:32:54.560 --> 01:33:01.280
but that's what people are saying in 1994 Lewis Dr Lewis goer published the

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:08.920
inscriptions he identified the script as linear a which is we know is protog Greek he's saying it's at least and I

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:16.639
looked into it it's at least part of this family of what me and Amon would call the palasan alphabet Pro pre-

01:33:16.639 --> 01:33:24.080
alphabets like they're similar are they all linear a and then you see look at Linear B like are they is one is l b

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:31.040
come from linear a I don't really know I'm not I can't tell you on that but there's like a lot of stuff being written about this stuff and it's not

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:38.440
the picture is not there yet there still is so much work needs to be done all right so considers as highly see

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:43.480
obviously you can see people there's no way highly unlikely so people are not

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:50.159
liking this at all here but here's the thing what does it date to that's that's what I want to know the archaeological

01:33:50.159 --> 01:33:56.440
analysis the inscriptions of the Trojan script date to the third Cent third millennium

01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:02.159
BCE 2,200 what this is over a thousand years

01:34:02.159 --> 01:34:09.080
before The The Phoenician alphabet now it's possible that this

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:15.239
form of script could have some influence on I'm thinking could have I'm I'm

01:34:15.239 --> 01:34:20.840
thinking if it's the Phoenicians I don't I don't really care if it's the Phoenicians Cadmus really invented the

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:27.440
alphabet but whatever the story is I don't really care I'm looking at the evidence and I'm saying there this looks

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:35.360
like there could be some precedent here for the alphabet coming from this part of the world okay all right the next

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:41.119
thing I want to do now I'm gonna be careful not to kick myself off again I promise so let's see what else do we got

01:34:41.119 --> 01:34:47.239
I want to show something real quick the Beretta stelli make sure I'm not gonna get kicked off okay good Beretta Stell this

01:34:47.239 --> 01:34:53.480
this is the weirdest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever so as as we've already disc discussed at length

01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:59.840
the nobody is talking about Israel until the helenistic era Persian period

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:06.920
helenistic per it's just not really in in the sources at barely so the it's

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:14.360
like is there a kingdom there is there a is it a nation is it a city state what's going on here so this is the consensus

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:19.760
in Bible scholar world that this is the oldest inscription of Israel and it's

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:25.920
like this is everyone just accepts this straight up and it's there's actually it doesn't fit with the with the with

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:30.960
the data like there are no other inscriptions anywhere in all the

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:36.440
Egyptian hieroglyphs of mentioning the word Israel in fact the word Israel doesn't

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:41.920
even show up in Egyptian hieroglyphics it only shows up in the later htic

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:49.880
demonic scripts that come after King bakaras by the way after 700 BC so

01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:56.560
before that when it was during the age of the hieroglyphs you never ever the word Israel just not in there so they

01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:02.600
find this random Mell and the story behind it is so funny so I got to read

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:08.960
this first of all let me show you what it says apparently the translation is the princes are are prostrate peace no

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:14.560
one raises his head among the nine bows desolation is for J jeenu hati is

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:20.080
pacified plundered is the Canan with every evil wait we already have Canan in

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:25.760
here I thought I thought Bible scholar says Canan in Israel are synonymous

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:31.800
that's weird why would Israel and Canaan both be in here right but okay what does it

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:37.920
actually say though if you actually look at the hieroglyphs it doesn't say Israel it says

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:44.440
yes I mean why why is they assuming this is Israel I have no idea no clue why the

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:50.080
people just assume this is Israel why why can't it be Syria in fact why some

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:55.920
people have said you look down here there's three citations here and I know there there's actually more than that if

01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:02.159
you look into it but Wikipedia gives three citations of Scholars who say that

01:37:02.159 --> 01:37:07.400
this is jezrael this isn't Israel this is jezrael Israel didn't exist yet some

01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:13.560
people say it being wearers of the selck but the bottom line is this it doesn't say Israel it says

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:18.880
yes and they just assume it's Israel but here's the funny part um when when you

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:24.800
find something like this and it's it's and it's a complete needle and a hay stack as far

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:30.360
as the evidence goes like if if there was a bunch of other inscriptions from this time period that mention Israel I

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:36.119
would have no reason to doubt this but the fact that it's just sitting by itself and then the next the next time

01:37:36.119 --> 01:37:41.800
in the sources Israel was mentioned is all the way all the way down in the 800s

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:50.800
BC or some 8th Century BC or something so we're talking 500e Gap from the first

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:58.199
time Israel's mentioned to the second time it's mentioned ever in the sources or um that just doesn't that should be a

01:37:58.199 --> 01:38:04.440
red flag but I just you got to hear this story so here's the story this is this is referenced

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:11.280
from this is referen from a journal article from drawer in 1995 called

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:18.440
flinder's Petry a life in archaeology I you should read this yourself it's it's from the University of Wisconsin press

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:25.320
this is what he he reports it's almost like a transcript of what happened when they found this and it says Petri called

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:30.679
upon willlam Spielberg a German philologist in his archaeological team

01:38:30.679 --> 01:38:38.199
to translate the inscription by the way these people were looking for Israel they Wen they went

01:38:38.199 --> 01:38:43.400
out to find Israel in Egyptian sources they weren't like looking for something

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:51.000
else that stumbled on this their goal was to find Israel in the sources why

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.760
because Copenhagen International people who writes I I'll I'll talk about

01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:05.080
Copenhagen International they're called biblical minim minimalist it's a whole entire academic group completely at odds

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:11.320
with the sbl types um the seminarian types they're and they they're all just saying the whole Bible is just fairy

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:18.560
tale doesn't match up with the history at all so these people started to really they were starting to really win in

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:24.719
these debate circles as far as the evidence as far as they were they're showing look there's Persian loan words

01:39:24.719 --> 01:39:30.639
there's helenistic loan words these texts are written later that's what these people have been saying this for a

01:39:30.639 --> 01:39:35.880
hundred years this is not new alon's not bringing anything new here neither am I

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:41.440
this has been being discussed for a hundred years now you just don't hear about it a lot but you can look into it

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:48.639
look into the Copenhagen International Bible Society you'll see a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that we're saying right now so anyways

01:39:48.639 --> 01:39:54.239
the the point is they're starting to win in in in these academic debates so now

01:39:54.239 --> 01:40:00.080
people need to find a we need to find evidence so we can clap back at these people so here's the

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:06.400
story spelberg was puzzled by one symbol towards the end that a people or a tribe

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:15.360
whom mpta had victoriously smitten i s i e Sr

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:22.440
R huh pet quickly suggests that it reads Israel it's Israel just assumes it

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:30.599
spiegelberg agreed that this translation must be correct won't the Reverend be

01:40:30.599 --> 01:40:37.320
pleased won't the Reverend be pleased I'm Gonna Be Rich I'm Gonna Be Rich

01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:44.639
remarked Petri at the dinner that evening Petri who realized the importance of this find says this Stelly

01:40:44.639 --> 01:40:50.199
will be better known in the world than anything else I have found the news of

01:40:50.199 --> 01:40:57.000
dis discovery made headlines when it reached English papers now let's just be

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:02.719
these are common sense now you have incentives to go and find this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and

01:41:02.719 --> 01:41:08.400
look how they just find something close enough it's in the it's in the general

01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:16.520
location ignore that canan's already on that list just don't tell anybody about that part but it's Israel is is it's

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:23.800
Israel yes it must be won't the Reverend be pleased probably got rich off that Rich

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:28.880
for the rest of their that the that was the greatest discovery that person will ever make they had every incentive so

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.960
I'm just saying look maybe it is Israel I'm keeping an open mind here but I'm

01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:40.280
just saying why is it accepted so people who there's Scholars right now I'm not

01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:48.960
going to call out names anymore I'm not going to do that I we did that a few times but you guys know who I'm talking about who are winning awards from the S

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:54.119
winning the greatest if you're the greatest scholar of the year award

01:41:54.119 --> 01:42:01.360
people who are just literally going on Tik Tok telling people that this is real and this scholarly consensus is 100%

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:07.840
agrees that this is real which is not true there is a bunch of debate about the Manelli it's not accepted by every

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:16.320
scholar in fact I think the evidence shows that this was kind of like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all right so I want to

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:22.480
talk about one more thing and then I'm done that's that's what I wanted to I wanted to talk about that alphabet but

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:28.199
the next thing I want to discuss real quick is um this is this is a big one so

01:42:28.199 --> 01:42:34.679
let me I'm going to share my screen one more time I promise I won't get kicked off this time so that was really bad all

01:42:34.679 --> 01:42:41.800
right this is GNA be crazy so you you always hear this the helenistic period right what's the helenistic period the

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:50.440
helenistic period is from the time Alexander the Great conquered the East so 3:33 3:32 or whatever till the time of

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:58.639
Rome all right so you you get this Dogma in in academics and Bible scholar world

01:42:58.639 --> 01:43:05.760
where there it's impossible that any Greek influence could happen on anything before the helenistic period the Greeks

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:14.719
were nobody's before the helenistic period that is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and the evidence proves this so I got a couple sources

01:43:14.719 --> 01:43:21.840
I'm almost done I promised but this this will be cool you'll like this so I'm going back to my uh screen

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:28.400
again and uh see this coin right here that's

01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:35.280
Yao as you can see y alif v it's not

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:41.560
four letters it's three letters from the fourth Century

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:48.360
BC and guess what it's from the Persian period but it's obvious and and by the

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:55.920
way every scholar who who's identified this coin says it's influenced by helenistic

01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:02.800
imagery of Zeus holding the eagle that is an image of Zeus there is no other

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:10.000
you can't say that's Aura Mazda you can't say that's some Indian guy no look this up

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.960
for yourself don't listen to me that is Zeus in the being called Yahweh that

01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:23.679
means Hellenism was in Hellenism not the in the sense of the of the ageism in the of

01:44:23.679 --> 01:44:30.080
Greek like was already influencing the East way before Alexander the Great Well

01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:37.080
I wouldn't say way before but a century before at least this coin proves this and by the way there's more look here's

01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:42.159
another one that's Yahweh let's Zeus but it says Yahweh on

01:44:42.159 --> 01:44:49.239
it it's Persian period coin here's another one that's clearly Zeus with his

01:44:49.239 --> 01:44:57.599
Eagle totally Jupiter Zeus whatever you want to call him that's this is a Persian period coin and it says Yahweh

01:44:57.599 --> 01:45:04.159
on it okay now there's actually there's what

01:45:04.159 --> 01:45:10.159
so what's going on here how are the Greeks influencing the East if they're not ruling Babylon that's that's what a

01:45:10.159 --> 01:45:17.000
Bible scholar would say and cl to clap back at me and I'll just say well you don't know the sources then because

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.320
Herodotus tells us all about what's going by the way uh diodorus of Sicily

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:29.920
mentions that yaho is the god of Moses and he spells it why I AO and he says

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:35.400
that this is like some synchronistic synchronistic God of the like basically

01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:42.560
it's like all these Gods rolled into one macrobius mentions this too so people know about yaho in fact cheli and Oracle

01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:48.840
say it's the name of bakus and I've showed you guys that before that's a whole I didn't bring that with me but I want to show

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:58.639
something about Herodotus and then Alexander the Great and then I'm done itus actually discusses something

01:45:58.639 --> 01:46:06.080
in um this one right here so Herodotus

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:13.199
says where is it here we go this is cool now Herodotus

01:46:13.199 --> 01:46:19.880
is way before Alexander the Great he says that when the Persians

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:26.560
came to sirene the country of sirene which is the highest part of Libya which

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:32.599
the nomads inhabit has The Marvelous Boon of three Harvest Seasons he talks about them for a little bit so who are

01:46:32.599 --> 01:46:40.000
the sirines right I'm just going to show share another screen real quick um I had to show you guys this sirene all right

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:46.239
so Bara Bara is this ancient city right and

01:46:46.239 --> 01:46:53.480
uh it's it's a Greek city uh say like you look at the history Barco appears to be a a Libyan tribe by

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:59.719
the way this is where medo is from too uh the Greek Settlers of sirene colonized it it shows that the Greeks

01:46:59.719 --> 01:47:05.239
were there all the way back in 7th Century BC her's place is the foundation of the city all right whatever so

01:47:05.239 --> 01:47:11.599
there's all this other there's all this stuff about this helenistic city look at there's Ammon right there so you can see

01:47:11.599 --> 01:47:18.119
there's obvious helenistic Greek influence that's from 475 BC during the

01:47:18.119 --> 01:47:23.280
augmented period Persian period guys why is there Greek gods on Persian period

01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:29.560
stuff because the Greeks are influencing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way before Alexander the Great people these These are people who are

01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:36.679
very influential Plato Aristotle Socrates phes people these are Brilliant

01:47:36.679 --> 01:47:42.119
Minds so the reason why I brought this up because I have one more thing I want to show

01:47:42.119 --> 01:47:47.320
you during the Persian period according to

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:56.040
Herodotus he says Herodotus says

01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:03.119
that the Persians well I'll just tell you it's in here he says that it's it's in book

01:48:03.119 --> 01:48:12.440
um book four or book yeah book four he says the Persians went to this

01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:18.199
Greek city took all the Greeks out of there and and ionians too so he set took

01:48:18.199 --> 01:48:23.599
ionians Persians are conquering Ionia and Egypt they they to conquer Greece

01:48:23.599 --> 01:48:28.719
and they lost everyone knows this famous battle between the Persians and the Greeks there's a few battles but they

01:48:28.719 --> 01:48:34.000
they did conquer the Egyptians and they conquered the ionians all these people

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.679
who are hen already influenced by the Greeks he says that they sent them all

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:45.599
to Greco bactria Now where's that this is my last thing I want to show you guys

01:48:45.599 --> 01:48:51.000
this is just like tying it all together so batia if we look at the ented period

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.520
right see all the way over here all the way on the top left you see

01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:02.599
my mouse I don't know if you can see my mouse but all the way up here where it says Saka Sania

01:49:02.599 --> 01:49:08.239
batia so it turns out if you could check you fact check me on this these were

01:49:08.239 --> 01:49:15.560
Greek cities before Alexander the Great even got there because per the Cyrus

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:22.119
relocated Greeks from Ionia and sirene and set them up in these cities all the

01:49:22.119 --> 01:49:29.119
way in modern day Afghanistan so before Alex when Alexander the Great got to baa there was

01:49:29.119 --> 01:49:34.880
already Greek cities there and that's why they call him a liberator he was liberated it's there's actually a lot of

01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:40.199
people will say oh they only call him a liberator because the Victor's writing the history now that could be true in

01:49:40.199 --> 01:49:47.199
some cases but in this case it's not in this case Alexander the Great was seen as a liberator when he came to bactria

01:49:47.199 --> 01:49:52.480
and came to these cities they were like finally the Greeks are here great and

01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:59.000
the he built Alexandria the farthest which is all the way in modern day Afghanistan it actually was the last

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.599
helenistic city in the world last Greek Kingdom to exist in the world so when

01:50:04.599 --> 01:50:09.840
Rome conquered Greece when the solids fell and the tmes fell by to Rome there

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:16.320
was a kingdom all the way in Afghanistan it was still Greek and it lasted all the way to like 200 ad and no one ever talks

01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:24.440
about it all right last thing I want to show you guys is uh this is a cool passage from Alexander the Great and um

01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:29.480
or from Aryan about Alexander the Great this is so this is so cool and it just

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:36.199
kind of highlights the how far this bakic Empire reached and we talk about

01:50:36.199 --> 01:50:42.119
media and um by the way Herodotus when he talks about the um the start of the

01:50:42.119 --> 01:50:48.280
Trojan War this is in book one chapter one of Herodotus he says that the reason

01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:54.880
why the troan war happened is because yo with was kidnapped and then in

01:50:54.880 --> 01:51:00.280
retaliation of yo being kidnapped the Greeks captured media brought her to

01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:06.040
Athens and then the Trojans came in and retaliated to the Greeks and captured

01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:12.960
Helen so there's three princesses being Ro being um captured and that's why this

01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:18.960
war started and it's almost it's very strange that these three faces media

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:26.360
Helen of Troy and yo very in influential almost deified goddesses in many ways

01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:33.599
the way they're written about in these texts and they're all living in the same time period according to Herodotus and

01:51:33.599 --> 01:51:40.960
uh they're the reason why this war has happened there's the reason why we have civilization and so when Alexander

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:46.239
finally goes west or I mean East he um this is what aryion says about this this

01:51:46.239 --> 01:51:53.239
is a cool text um where is it maybe I didn't that one all right

01:51:53.239 --> 01:52:00.199
whatever so um yeah Alexander I'll just tell you the story it's an Aryan Alexander the Great

01:52:00.199 --> 01:52:05.520
travels all the way to barria and he says that they were in these mountains that they thought was Nissa the city of

01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:11.480
Nissa of dianis and uh they found Wild Ivy growing on the mountains so

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:17.960
Alexander and his um comp and his compatriots took the ivy off dawned him

01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:23.880
as Reese and started having a bakic they went into a bakic frenzy immediately that's that's what Arion

01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:29.159
says um cool story by the way and uh I'm just going to leave you with this last

01:52:29.159 --> 01:52:36.159
thing that I want to show you guys so there's the earliest sources

01:52:36.159 --> 01:52:42.960
about know Amo was talking about the earliest mentions of any of these texts or anyone mentioning Moses anyone

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:48.599
mentioning um Abraham it's when you look at when these text start showing up or

01:52:48.599 --> 01:52:54.560
when these people start getting mentioned in the sources the um the the the first time it's mentioned is Hackus

01:52:54.560 --> 01:53:01.119
of abdera and then you get Mano then you get uh Alexander pistor you start

01:53:01.119 --> 01:53:07.800
getting and it's all it's all in the helenistic period and they're all Greek writers writing about Moses that this

01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:13.320
the stories don't match up with the Bible they're they're all happening later times Abraham is

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:19.119
like the stories are different the um the Jews living in

01:53:19.119 --> 01:53:27.800
elephantine who left EG Israel around in 500s go down in Egypt and they have

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:33.440
thousands of papy that they um that they discovered

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:41.560
in these cities and um thousands of Aramaic inscript papes and inscriptions

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:49.079
in this Egyptian City and these are Jews these are Jewish they're writing in Aramaic but they're Jews they never

01:53:49.079 --> 01:53:54.239
mentioned Abraham they never mentioned Moses they they never mention David they

01:53:54.239 --> 01:54:00.800
never mention Noah they don't mention anybody in the Bible and we're talking

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:07.560
400s 480 BCE that's that's not an argument from

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:14.840
Silence that's an argument of no evidence that's not an argument from Silence that's an argument of no

01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:21.040
evidence all right and that's last thing I want to show you guys I keep saying that but this is really it this

01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:26.599
character museus of a no one ever talks about this but msus of

01:54:26.599 --> 01:54:33.480
Athens was um supposedly he was the son of orus and he composed these texts called

01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:38.520
the creso the oracles and uh they're they're orphic

01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:46.760
orphic sto it's like they're like Bible stories basically they're prophetic wisdom they songs like the Psalms saloy

01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:53.480
means songs the word samoy means songs written or a harpist that's what the

01:54:53.480 --> 01:55:01.000
word s means in Greek it's a Greek Psalms are Greek it's a very orphic concept um even the fact they're in the

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:07.679
septu agent I have it over here somewhere my hand you D septu agent

01:55:07.679 --> 01:55:14.520
check this out there's a there's a Psalm it's it's called Psalm 151 but it's not it's it's before the Christian Bibles

01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:20.920
started numbering stuff so it's actually just at the end of it's at the end of Psalms so it's actually technically part

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:27.679
of Psalm 150 and if you read it it's like or it's it's about it's about King David playing his liar and calming all

01:55:27.679 --> 01:55:33.800
the animals and trees sounds like Orpheus it's an orphic Psalm um and so

01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:41.119
this character just put up the screen one more time real quick and this is the last one this character mosus of Athens

01:55:41.119 --> 01:55:49.040
was the son of Orpheus who was considered to be look at this this is how they describe him he he's a a

01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:56.400
polymath a philosopher a historian a proph a Seer a priest a poet and a

01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:03.920
musician who does that sound like sounds like Moses miss lawgiver all that stuff

01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:09.239
um yeah one of the stories about him he came to the he went to the Frans and

01:56:09.239 --> 01:56:17.199
gave them laws so he's a lawgiver too and he's mentioned about he's mentioned all these sources right and by the way

01:56:17.199 --> 01:56:23.560
if you look at the early Jewish writers philosophers and and um this is

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:31.079
mentioned in Yus preparatio evangelica artanis of Alexandria Alexander po hisor

01:56:31.079 --> 01:56:39.719
penus of apamea and um it doesn't say it here but um Hackus of abdera too all say

01:56:39.719 --> 01:56:45.920
that this is Moses so this Greek Athenian

01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:51.719
character uh is they're saying is the real Moses that Moses is sort of based

01:56:51.719 --> 01:56:59.960
off this guy they're sort of taking the story of musas of Athens and sort of rewriting a story of a lawgiver from

01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:06.239
from Egypt instead of going from Athens to friia he's going from Egypt to Judea

01:57:06.239 --> 01:57:11.679
but the stories are they line up like perfectly so anyways uh that's my that's

01:57:11.679 --> 01:57:17.520
my I brought I brought some text I'm a little scatterbrain today but I just wanted to try to complement what he's

01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:23.520
saying about the linguistic side and give some of the historical side

01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:30.199
that was gorgeous absolutely gorgeous oh my god um how many degrees have you

01:57:30.199 --> 01:57:35.560
gotten in the last couple of years my goodness I don't care

01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:41.639
about I care about I care about the text I care about like finding stuff out I

01:57:41.639 --> 01:57:47.639
don't really give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about a degree I don't care about awards from the SPL I don't care [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about none of that

01:57:47.639 --> 01:57:54.880
yeah you know you're doing what they're not doing so isn't that funny you are

01:57:54.880 --> 01:58:04.000
really the ideal scholar um and you're not sucked into the BS that is Academia

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.560
and the selling of books and pedaling of position and authority and hoooo so nice

01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:16.520
job beautiful job my God some somebody asked me recently if I think there's a

01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:22.199
conspiracy for academics to like like uh you know whatever and I go no it's it's

01:58:22.199 --> 01:58:28.040
not that it's an environment of of strong

01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:33.639
dogmas and and you it's there's no conspiracy there's no it's not like one

01:58:33.639 --> 01:58:40.119
scholar secretly like telling them oh I think they're all right and we need to hide the truth it's not none of that's

01:58:40.119 --> 01:58:45.760
going on what I think is going on is New Testament scholarship is so dominated by

01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:53.239
people who want this stuff to be true that it's sort of when when Scholars get when new students come up in these

01:58:53.239 --> 01:58:59.440
seminars they're being pushed in a direction where they can't even challenge the status quo because they

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:05.880
won't have a job their books won't get sold they won't be part of the crew they they'll be outcasted and they don't want

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:12.719
that so they sort of um subconsciously just um just go along with whatever is

01:59:12.719 --> 01:59:20.679
being taught to them and they're not really they're not really um they're not really being being given any reason to

01:59:20.679 --> 01:59:28.000
go outside instead to outside and and discover they're they're be they're it's like they're being conditioned to just

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:34.880
be part of the system that's already there and just serve the system rather than go out and discover something that

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:39.920
no one's discovered yet and and I'm not saying people don't do that but I'm

01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:45.000
saying there's so much Dogma in trying to keep all this historical and try to

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:51.840
keep oh the you know Israel is so ancient and they're way way older than the Greeks and they it's all yeah that

01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:58.159
whole whole Dogma is just so strong that it can't be questioned that's what I think it's

01:59:58.159 --> 02:00:03.360
going on yeah it's always a matter of whether or not you can crack that

02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:10.440
ceiling of what um where the control mechanism is right to shut you down

02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:18.079
because whoever brings you that history is that stuff floating around the air around us um I thought that was uh

02:00:18.079 --> 02:00:23.840
brilliantly done I have a question I have a question for you um you think

02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:29.639
that old um that fifth you know 5000

02:00:29.639 --> 02:00:37.159
BC you think that that's crazy isn't it yeah do you think that's probably

02:00:37.159 --> 02:00:42.719
palasan um what else would be yeah is that is that is that where you would go

02:00:42.719 --> 02:00:49.440
with that I mean that's where I want to go but God how can we break that down and figure out if it is because it

02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:57.079
sounds like de how did that thing end up in a Neolithic Village surrounded by

02:00:57.079 --> 02:01:04.079
Neolithic pottery with a on a piece of wood that's carinated to that same Neolithic period how the hell did that

02:01:04.079 --> 02:01:09.360
get there and I'll I'll admit that's an anomaly it doesn't make any sense but

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:17.920
like then you look but then okay that that's because we're jumping from 5,000 BC to 2,000 BC when you start seeing

02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:25.320
similar which is they call it the troan script when when you start seeing similar scripts linear a comes comes

02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:31.400
from uh creit so the whole Mediterranean seems to have similar style of writing

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:37.480
whereas in Egypt it's hieroglyphics in in in s in Middle East it's copor but in

02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:43.280
the Mediterranean world you see this what looks like Proto alphabetic scripts

02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:48.920
which is what the whole point I was trying to make was it looks like the alphabet isn't coming froma form or

02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:55.440
hieroglyphics it's coming from over here and the evidence people are ignoring the Trojan script they're just writing it

02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:00.719
off no no no that's not real but it's like what is it then it's something it's

02:02:00.719 --> 02:02:07.239
something it's sitting there let's figure out what it is why does nobody care and and you know when you brought

02:02:07.239 --> 02:02:13.960
up you were like well it doesn't really look like it but maybe I'm telling you I'm telling you when I went into EMT

02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:20.440
Bennett who cracked Linear B the first time I looked at a linear B tablet I it

02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:27.920
is nowhere near um any of the Greek that I had been taught um so yeah the fact

02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:33.599
that there is something there is actually what's most important it'll take the Egghead some time to crack that

02:02:33.599 --> 02:02:39.400
one but I sure hope it's palasan you know it's been 30 years since they

02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:46.599
discovered it in Macedonia and no no peer-reviewed articles have been published zero so

02:02:46.599 --> 02:02:51.639
it's just sitting there no one's done any work on it it's like do they people

02:02:51.639 --> 02:02:57.119
do people not is is there no incentive for anybody to talk about this and I'm not saying there's a conspir like I said

02:02:57.119 --> 02:03:02.639
I'm not saying conspiracy I'm saying there's nobody care is that what's going on nobody cares they just want this to

02:03:02.639 --> 02:03:08.800
be oh the Phoenicians created the alphabet from from Egyptian and they gave it to the Greeks well what what the

02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:15.520
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is this what are these inscriptions then why are they why does it look so similar to Greek yeah I think it's I

02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:20.800
think it's laziness too you got to factor that in if there's not money in

02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:26.159
it and and let's be honest cracking something like this you know it's

02:03:26.159 --> 02:03:33.480
probably not going to yield you a big you know nobody's going to make you rich over it and give you sponsors right um

02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:40.520
unless unless you can successfully if you can successfully slam dunk 100% Pro

02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:46.440
and change the academic consensus and say look we think the alphabet might have came from somewhere

02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:51.920
else and then if you can do that that that'll make you famous forever but

02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:58.360
against a brick wall right now that doesn't want if you the Wikipedia article shows you every person who tried

02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:04.159
to publish say It's Greek got shut down immed no way it's not Greek can't be

02:04:04.159 --> 02:04:10.280
Greek you know the phans made the alphabet shut up sit down no that's that's really what's been happening so

02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:16.559
the question is if it's not Greek then what is it yeah yeah the that's exactly

02:04:16.559 --> 02:04:22.639
what they were saying about lenar be because they did not know it was Greek to start with right so yeah it's a it's

02:04:22.639 --> 02:04:27.920
a great candidate um with everything the Greeks are saying about the pans and you

02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:35.040
know now Neil because you've been reading the sources it only makes sense that the language is going directly back

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:41.520
to that ancestor so um yeah yeah I think I think we're

02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:46.840
ready just to clarify when I say Greek obviously what I mean is Proto Greek

02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:53.000
palasan mean I'm talking I'm not talking about like they didn't maybe they didn't call themselves Greeks yeah but I'm

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:58.480
saying this area and this in similar Indo-European language structure that's

02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:03.599
what I mean by that so what I say you mentioned media too if you don't mind I

02:05:03.599 --> 02:05:12.520
want to ask you um your opinion because um they also said that media was Helen

02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:19.639
and that she was the one who was projecting um Her Image into Achilles

02:05:19.639 --> 02:05:24.760
mind because you know media and ailles end up in in

02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:32.679
Elysium um as the bride pair in Elysium and when Achilles was in his all girl

02:05:32.679 --> 02:05:40.079
school um um de deia was there and she's the only Priestess who had intercourse

02:05:40.079 --> 02:05:47.360
with him um as he as he was disguised and our ancient sources actually say de

02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:52.679
deia is another way to say media wow so

02:05:52.679 --> 02:06:01.840
yeah too now check this out people don't know this there's a there's a text written by Homer it's lost but staus a

02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:09.559
Latin Roman in the in the Roman period he wrote I don't know if he translated Homer or if he re rewrote the story in

02:06:09.559 --> 02:06:16.599
Latin point is he's we he we had the story we know what it's about it's preserved in Latin but the Greek homeric

02:06:16.599 --> 02:06:22.000
text it's it's a prequel to The Iliad The Iliad wasn't just two books Iliad

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:28.400
and odyssey it was I think eight I think they said it's called an octat and I

02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:36.400
think it's it's called the achad which is the story of Achilles that you just mentioned and that story is

02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:42.840
crazy ailles grew up trans I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not look people going to

02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:48.559
say you're come on Jude you're applying modern techn stuff and no read the text

02:06:48.559 --> 02:06:54.400
he grew up as a girl amongst the amazonians and the Amazonian tribe of

02:06:54.400 --> 02:07:00.000
cyia he wore all girls clothing he was disguised as a girl his entire life

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:05.440
because um Zeus was gonna kill him if he found him but he did so about like

02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:11.880
that's the story I'm just telling that's the story um by the way okay back to Media that's

02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:19.119
what you asked me for I think Homer is giving an esoteric retelling of the Trojan War

02:07:19.119 --> 02:07:25.880
story because this is the he's yo is captured media is captured and Helen is

02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:34.159
captured he's he's TW it almost it's almost like the hecky three-headed goddess Because by the way who is Yo now

02:07:34.159 --> 02:07:40.040
we've already connected you just connected Meda and Helen that was great but what why is Yo there well yo you

02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:46.679
know who yo is Yo is the Christ yo is the character in Prometheus bound who

02:07:46.679 --> 02:07:51.960
gets stung by the gadfly and the word asist uses is ch

02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:58.360
christe Christy christed so media Helen

02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:05.119
yo is like a triple goddess Christ figure pre this is the Christ we've been

02:08:05.119 --> 02:08:12.400
say you and I have been talking about this for years now you've been you much longer but there is a ancient Christ and

02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:19.960
she was a goddess and I that's what I think is going on with Herodotus I think he's giving a a retelling of The Iliad

02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:25.679
it's book one chapter her read it for yourself where he says here's what happens before the IL before the events

02:08:25.679 --> 02:08:32.400
of Homer's Iliad Before Troy got captured and he's this random story about yo media and Helen all being

02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:39.280
captured at the same time it's very strange I think there's I think there's definitely something going on

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:45.880
there gorgeous gorgeous yeah no and uh there's um there's sometimes the

02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:53.360
language blocks us off from what they're actually kind of communicating cuz everybody knows like that Helen was able

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:59.040
to project Her Image so the Greeks will write about her actually being in Egypt

02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:04.440
she never went to Troy right she actually went to Egypt and projected Her

02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:10.040
Image there so what do they mean when they say this right what is what is

02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:18.119
going on in the Greek mind um and when you actually read that well um see

02:09:18.119 --> 02:09:25.599
Achilles had dreams and in these dreams he was visited by the medwa right all of

02:09:25.599 --> 02:09:31.079
a sudden you're into a cultural um practice you're into a cult practice and

02:09:31.079 --> 02:09:37.119
you're into this marriage this heros gamos right and these terms are familiar

02:09:37.119 --> 02:09:44.960
to them so when they're going through these myths when you're talking about ail that's who um you've got in the

02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:51.920
center of your um image he's essentially the guy who goes through the initiation

02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:58.199
right and realize media is actually older right she's projected into this

02:09:58.199 --> 02:10:03.920
generation um so it's you know but of course she always looks young always

02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:09.040
looks young it's an incredible cult um kind of operation that you wouldn't

02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:16.880
think you know people are like what does this have to do remember Isaiah is a prophetes right guess what media is

02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:24.840
she's not just a prophet she's the arch Prophet she's the one who brings the oracles right she's sitting enthroned on

02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:29.960
the island of Thea yeah what it looks like happening is the pro when you look

02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:35.440
at the prophets by the way um I mentioned the Copenhagen Society Russell

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:40.960
gurin has written a book it's peer-reviewed um he's got two of them right first he came out with this

02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:46.400
Plato's tus biblical creation accounts and he lays it out that the presocratic

02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:51.520
invented monism and obviously there's some Persian influence there too obviously

02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:57.840
not not denying that zor rash he talks about that too and then it gets that's why he says he dates the Helen he dates

02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:03.760
the Old Testament text the helenistic period um just like we both doing and

02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:09.679
then people shot back at him and said well if that's the case you would expect the law codes the law codes in in

02:11:09.679 --> 02:11:15.280
Deuteronomy are all ancient Babylonian law codes well then he came out with this book also peer-reviewed play to in

02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:20.800
the creation of the Hebrew Bible he shows that 75% of the law codes I think

02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:26.880
80 or 75 or 80% of the law codes the majority of the law codes in Deuteronomy

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:32.520
and Leviticus and numbers line up with Athenian law codes and only about 20% of

02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:38.840
them are from Babylonian or whatever Egyptian so most of them are actually do

02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:45.360
so he shot back to saying no you're actually wrong it's Greek still Greek so they then now now nobody you know what

02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:51.760
they do instead of having an academic discussion and debating write I mean write an article write a fiery article c

02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:58.040
talk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] back let's do this this is what acting supposed nobody they just ignore him in fact I went and Dan M this

02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:03.880
is I want went to one dad mlen live one time and he was answering questions it

02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:10.040
wasn't it wasn't super chats anyone that asked a question one by one he was reading them and answering them he got

02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:16.400
to my question what are your thoughts on Copenhagen and the biblical minimalism he didn't even read it he skipped right

02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:21.880
over me went to the next question they don't even want to engage with this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude why

02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:28.199
why yeah exactly that's what the appropriation is for right it gives you

02:12:28.199 --> 02:12:34.599
legitimacy if you don't have legitimacy your whole stack of cards falls down so

02:12:34.599 --> 02:12:41.079
yeah yeah love it love it that's a perfect way um Neil to kind of bring

02:12:41.079 --> 02:12:50.199
everything uh full circle um what we've got is a p um a group of languages and

02:12:50.199 --> 02:12:55.400
we've got this survival um this story that's playing

02:12:55.400 --> 02:13:01.079
out this narrative it's very biological and that thing um the best

02:13:01.079 --> 02:13:06.960
thing that you can do to follow that track is to watch how the Greek language

02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:13.000
so took over and influenced the world you got to remember of AR anglosaxon you

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:18.400
know 30% to a half of it somewhere it's coming from the Greek we're only able to

02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:23.840
get these Concepts because of that power powerful language as you mentioned

02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:31.239
because of the limitations on Germanic languages and English anglosaxon English

02:13:31.239 --> 02:13:36.920
being one of those Germanic languages we can only like we can borrow words from

02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:43.520
Greek but we can't express things like you try to translate a Greek text you're dumbing it down you're watering it down

02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:50.440
you're you're it's it's completely bottlenecked it becomes like a less becomes like a very rigid version you're

02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:58.360
right the Greek language is special it's very special it's very um it's very uh

02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:03.639
Advanced it's very and that's why that's why that's I think that's another reason

02:14:03.639 --> 02:14:12.719
to to suggest that the alphabet could come from such a place that's so advanced in writing I suspect that power

02:14:12.719 --> 02:14:18.079
was coming through the plasan side that's what that's what I think I think

02:14:18.079 --> 02:14:25.079
ancient Greek got its ump from that old alasan ancestor because they're always

02:14:25.079 --> 02:14:30.520
associating like specific religious rights with the pans so you know any of

02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:35.920
the terms that come through like the um we talked tonight about the

02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:42.480
laconian right and the source of that word being that we didn't say it but it was the howling right that Wolf's

02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:47.559
howling and the LC on um root um of that

02:14:47.559 --> 02:14:54.159
word um all of that is in the text but it's getting there from that Old palasan

02:14:54.159 --> 02:15:00.520
side and I'm I'm starting to think that it was the palasan who really had their

02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:07.760
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] together and had a language that was you know it was off the charts

02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:13.159
expressively and mechanically off the charts um not just in what it could

02:15:13.159 --> 02:15:21.199
express conceptually but in its flexibility and its native ability to

02:15:21.199 --> 02:15:26.400
build words and to use words together they're always using the same route

02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:32.920
paired next to each other they're always making contrast like inherent comparisons and

02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:39.599
contrasting that's it's amazing amazing you can even tell in the Greek sentence

02:15:39.599 --> 02:15:47.639
you can even tell whether or not an action is being performed for the benefit of the subject or not right it's

02:15:47.639 --> 02:15:53.079
like how did they figure this out how did they I I hope it was those palasi

02:15:53.079 --> 02:16:01.000
and those were horse tribes too that's why they ended up like you said in thesy um anywhere on limnos as well they

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:07.599
also ended up on limnos and that that stuff uh on limnos looks like it's you know people are trying to figure out

02:16:07.599 --> 02:16:12.880
that one too they're like which language is this right yeah cypriot Sy it's called

02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:20.239
cyot um syllables or whatever then you have um you have lydian the lydian

02:16:20.239 --> 02:16:25.599
alphabet yeah it looks like it looks like it looks like some people some people say it looks Phoenician but it

02:16:25.599 --> 02:16:32.359
looks very Greek too probably some sort of ancestor of what we're talking about some sort of

02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:38.598
some sort of palasan thing that started off and then you have like the louan hittite languages those are all

02:16:38.599 --> 02:16:45.280
Indo-European they they line up more with Greek than they do with anything semetic um and some of they use Cano

02:16:45.281 --> 02:16:50.678
form for a while but then during the Persian period they start using the alphabet so you start getting you start

02:16:50.679 --> 02:16:55.840
getting these Indo-European languages very similar they have like they worship

02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:01.319
Artemis like Artemis is in their Lang like there's so much Greek overlap with

02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:08.000
the hittite languages like the lydian languages the frians the capid oans the ionians were just so brilliant they were

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.598
just the scientists of the ancient world they they started civilization there those are the that's where

02:17:13.599 --> 02:17:21.200
everything all the credit is due to the ionians totally hypocrates you were mentioning famous U people in ant

02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:27.439
hypocrates baby he writes in a beautiful ionian it's gorgeous and it's kind of

02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:35.000
you you were talking about the oath you were reading the oath the other day looking at that oath isn't that delicious the translation that that the

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:42.200
current translation is so christianized it's so bad they have like holy in there and there's no holy in there they

02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:49.800
they're just like throwing words in that don't exist or that aren't in the trans the Greek our duty it's our duty to

02:17:49.800 --> 02:17:55.840
protect that yeah they made yeah they took the so the translation that you look look up the hypocritic oath and you

02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:02.200
read it on Wikipedia you're going to read of christianized version of it it's not the same the Greek's a lot different

02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:07.678
and by the way the christianized version says I will never give somebody a an

02:18:07.679 --> 02:18:14.638
abortion if you read it's not in there it says it says I will not give anybody aphrodisiacs against their will says the

02:18:14.639 --> 02:18:21.960
exact opposite why is how did that happen it talks about the thosa the death inducer

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:27.719
too it's the context of the pharmacology that you have to get in to your mind

02:18:27.719 --> 02:18:34.558
yeah everybody makes a big deal about that um um I wanted to ask you while

02:18:34.559 --> 02:18:41.439
I've got you prisoner tell me um the herculanum library so 800 Scrolls um

02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:49.240
probably with a lot that we're not um we're not uh e we don't even know who the authors are right um so tell me this

02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:54.598
what is your understanding of or how do you think

02:18:54.599 --> 02:19:01.880
people are getting it how important this thing is how important this library is from what I from from what I've seen

02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:10.558
people talk about it like other other YouTubers who are into this stuff are also on their on the edge of their seat

02:19:10.559 --> 02:19:17.040
can't wait to see what's going to happen they they translated a text that it was like a philosophical Doctrine about

02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:23.200
about having good being in good how to be in good cheer Spirits or something something along those lines and you can

02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:29.080
just tell it's just some Greek [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that's all they write about it's all about Aesthetics and some pre cratic

02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:35.800
talking about like the epicurian are like it's all about being cheerful the stoics it's all good chill

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:42.719
it's all good chill that's the freak attitude man I love the stoics I love the cynic the cynics I love the cynics

02:19:42.719 --> 02:19:49.359
they don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cynic throw out your wealth there's a picture of Cates I call ammo and Cates that no one knows

02:19:49.359 --> 02:19:56.040
this one more I'm G show one more thing I gotta s this so C's from of I think

02:19:56.040 --> 02:20:01.080
he's from Athens I don't know where he's from uh I found it okay Cates of Athens

02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:07.680
check check this out right I I call ammo and Cates all the time when I when I talk to him because he reminds me of

02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:14.680
this dude ready all right you got it so Cates of Athens was a was one of the uh

02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:20.439
he was a student of diynes the cynic and there's that famous painting of him oh

02:20:20.439 --> 02:20:27.000
where is it they don't have it on here um CES

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:34.680
painting of Athens I gotta show him this this is you all day here it

02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:41.359
is all right hold on I got to share my other screen now ready for this this is ammo all day

02:20:41.359 --> 02:20:48.280
dumping out his wealth he doesn't care see he's dumping out all the diamonds because the cynic had this

02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:55.080
attitude of reject riches live in nature live in a live in go to the inner city

02:20:55.080 --> 02:21:02.319
and live in a barrel and you'll see you'll be happy one day if you can figure out how to live like that that was a cynic attitude man stoicism

02:21:02.319 --> 02:21:08.359
actually comes out of cynicism um the first stoic Zeno was a student of Cates

02:21:08.359 --> 02:21:16.720
so it goes It goes diyes who's around for Socrates diyes then Cates and then

02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:21.920
Zeno the first stoic so stoicism comes out of C ISM you need you need to be

02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:28.720
cynic to be you need to be a cynic before you can be a stoic mix isn't that crazy I like that the cynics are called

02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:33.800
cynic because they were considered dogs yeah dog like that's what I have it on

02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:39.680
my Twitter account dog like live be happy in life

02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:47.640

02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:52.800
could you live like a dog life is good that's the

02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:58.120
attitude that's diyes baby he just did what he wanted you know what I mean he

02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:05.800
was the only dog that didn't leave town when the bad guys came because he didn't care he was the anti he was the Satan of

02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:10.920
Plato because there's stories about him and Plato live together they hated each

02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:16.520
other and there's stories about diyes confronting Plato and saying dude I

02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:23.399

this because I heard that there's Classics departments being shut

down Bible or you know ancient studies being shut down and my first reaction to that was like that can't be good but

you watch my videos from three years ago I I saying some crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I don't think today why why did I change my mind

02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:58.240
because I was able to throw them I didn't just hold on to my theories and keep them to myself I threw them out there on the internet and they got

02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:05.520
tested in the fire and if I was wrong I was wrong and then I changed that I I would adjust my theories and uh my my
