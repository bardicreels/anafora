00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.520
Hilaria this is hilarious we are approaching the Hilaria if we are Romans

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.520
we are approaching the Hilaria and what are we going to do when we get into the

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.919
Hilaria we're going to honor the great mother

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:20.699
we're going to bring our people's focus upon the dying

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:27.180
and the resurrection yes this is you know set in stone for

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.240
long before the any of the Bible is sitting there right so

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:40.380
um this is what we're going to do we're going to celebrate it here we're going to call this compound drug compound drug

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.500
the polypharmicon polypharmicon we're gonna I believe we have the term

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.900
I should be right on it there we go thanks Chewie look at this Polo Pharma

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.080
cross he gives us andromicus opwood Galen right from Galen

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.280
um and we see that polu thronos the mini throne right and from the Candor so what is

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:13.560
something that is Paulo pharmacose it's a compound a substance that is made up of multiple

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.720
different um singularities uh the Romans love to

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.960
write books about drugs and whether they were samples

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:32.220
or compounds they had to step up on our Pharmacy today and I want to talk about

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.800
that I want to talk about the next level of where you take this knowledge keep

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:45.600
your hand on that cord that cord through the cave is the pharmacology right we all worship

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.000
reason here right it is the pharmacology so let's see how

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.020
um what we can do with give give us back her text yeah so he says Caesar let me tell you about it it's Hilaria right and

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:06.419
it's called the calm it's called the calm that which brings you Joy or that which calms the storm

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:13.139
that is calmed um you could think of it as a drug name

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:20.639
right and what it does it calms the storm great therapy fantastic and it's called

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:27.060
good God good God why because we're talking about possession we're talking about

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:34.860
possession in the Renaissance of the pharmacology is we

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:41.160
push into that Frontier again in an attempt to bring Health to people

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:49.080
this ancient methodology will be revivified

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:56.280
yes it will they'll explain it with Better Math yeah better math and maybe some computer

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:03.539
modeling but it will resurface it will resurface that knowledge that's

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:09.900
what the hope of the museum is that's why we create a museum here people have

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:18.180
been asking me what are we doing right which way are we going to go which direction this this right

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:24.599
um we stay with the museum we stay with reason keep your hand on that cord we're talking about the pharmacology chewy

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:32.399
bring that up again text so what is this thing going to do this drug that I'm taking it is it is going

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:39.380
to take you through that Dark Harbor and don't worry

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:46.760
it doesn't matter that you have taken the poppy

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:54.860
it doesn't matter that you have taken the hemlock

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:04.040
it doesn't matter that you have taken Z

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:11.160
death bringing drugs and when I say death bring I mean

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:17.160
um clinically uh technically um this the jargon

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:23.220
oh the day the death Bringers right it's a class of drug death Bringers

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:30.899
like that opium that we just talked about so um what we're seeing is a nice uh uh

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:39.180
rendition of the formulation of the compound Sacrament that was used in Ritu

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:46.800
in Ritu that induces this state and this is the state this post-death

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:53.160
state fantastic um and it doesn't matter I'll just run through zip through quick it doesn't

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:59.880
matter yeah says andromicus it doesn't matter that

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:07.860
this thing uh that you've had that you've been exposed to is the Viper

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:14.700
or the asp it doesn't matter it doesn't matter

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:20.339
why would it not matter and why would you be exposing yourself to these things

00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:27.000
so that you can become immune we've talked about this and for most of you this is review

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.240
okay but we've come this far and now I want to continue and show you

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:39.200
what the significance is of that formulation

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:45.060
with another ghost let's bring up

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:50.760
here we go yeah Calderon there we go first one

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:56.279
there we go oh no up here yes okay so

00:10:56.279 --> 00:11:03.360
um look we're in the 17th century sailing in the 17th century we're gonna make our first stop here jump out roll

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:10.860
out right of the time machine here we go we're talking about um uh plays

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:17.940
um and we're talking about very well educated

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:26.100
um Gent with access to classical knowledge access to classical knowledge and he is

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.800
going to tell us through his sources about Cersei and if I'm good enough as a

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.620
classical philologist I can show you where his sources are that's what's cool

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:45.240
about it so anyway um here we go I just want to read to you this translation right old Spanish I

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.399
don't do it I just doesn't not my thing and I wouldn't ever pretend for it to be

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:56.519
okay but look at these the this is a 19th century translation when people

00:11:56.519 --> 00:12:02.160
still valued Calderon right okay it's okay he's still here right the professor friend of mine is going to give me a

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.760
hard time okay um he says uh conquering adverse fate

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:13.980
you have come bearing these Divine flowers with thee this is Odysseus

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:20.760
coming and this is Cersei and Odysseus interacting right and Odysseus has shown up with a plant

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:28.560
that's been given to him by Iris a plant okay and um yeah he says uh

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.959
bearing these Divine flowers with the which are beauteous antidotes

00:12:33.959 --> 00:12:39.899
which are God sent exorcisms

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:46.019
against deadly poisoned giraffes against magical bewitchments

00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:53.160
right so for the for the hardcore pharmacologists or talks person

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.260
right um yeah I don't go into the

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:05.399
into the witchery I'm sorry uh you're gonna have to you're gonna have to because there's a

00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:12.839
there's an entire language to describe these different states yeah and um and the use of these drugs

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:18.839
these compounds yes in order to create the communion okay blast that off there

00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:24.839
let's go back good um good uh next let's go next to the

00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:32.459
boom here's another one this is what iris you know says

00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:38.220
see this floral Branch I bear jammed with buds that floor attended it will be

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:44.220
the antidote against cersei's poison secrets

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.060
nice nice

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.700
who is this Cersei in order to bring her up we're gonna have to go get Alice from Alice in

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:04.440
Wonderland this is the Oxford Greek Lexicon middle of the 19th century knowing many

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.720
drugs or charms great who does that look at the first word we've got there in

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:16.380
Greek those are doctors you see the reference is The Iliad 16.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:22.380
so at least by Homer's time right we have this concept this is an

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:30.060
old old concept who else is this way she is one of these knowing drugs or

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:36.200
charms what is a charm a charm biochemist friend of mine

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.880
is a something that you put inside of your

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:48.260
body that causes you to enter a state

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:55.079
yeah okay beginning of the Psychedelic Renaissance here we go let's let's bring

00:14:55.079 --> 00:15:02.040
that back up that definition please thank you Chewie who else do we call this Polo pharmacos many drugged

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:09.060
um pie on Pion all right pie on who's who is Pion

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:17.279
e who is Pion um yeah just come back to me

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:25.740
um Pion is the rapeutic manifestation

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:31.279
yeah the great Archer

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:39.779
yeah the great Archer who by his poison brought to you by the serpents

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:45.720
he brings both death and life

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:52.139
yeah people always wondered about that when I was in graduate school why is it why is it it's a healing cult it's but

00:15:52.139 --> 00:16:00.540
he's the god of death right right it's because you have to keep your hand on that rope and that rope is the

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:06.600
pharmacology okay look at these cultures and look what they're doing look what they're

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:13.860
using right Calderon is using specific sources bring up the next please

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:19.220
notice that he describes Cersei as negro Mante

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:26.639
encantadora in ergumina now excuse me if I mispronounce that but I'm he's showing

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:34.500
you the words in the original that he's using for necromancer a singer or enchanter

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:42.660
right and one who is controlled by die monase he just stole a Greek word he

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:49.079
just stole it I saw that dirty Calderon I saw him he just Dove back there into

00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:55.500
the pool of antiquity and he's swam and he pulled up a word out of it and he

00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:01.259
gave it to his people I thought that's a that's a person worth honoring

00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:07.260
right there I I admire that okay next I think we've got one more cholera

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:13.678
here this is we're describing Cersei right we're describing Cersei and she says

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:19.260
that great star whose undiminished power and Beauty let alone captive day untired

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:27.298
delighted was my splinter Crown fire nice all of these children Cersei and

00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:33.660
Medea that we talk about they are the granddaughters of the Sun

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:39.179
yes the granddaughters of the Sun within our cult

00:17:39.179 --> 00:17:46.679
of sun moon and stars so when I talk about darkening the Sun

00:17:46.679 --> 00:17:51.720
right when I talk about the power of the Moon these are the things this geometry

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:58.620
is coming from Antiquity and this Spaniard is swimming he's swimming in it

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:04.860
love it and what does he say being of Medea is kindred

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:12.059
I with her a child was reared in thessally as a sister

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:18.179
she was reared with her in thessally as a sister and why is this important that we bring up thessally

00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:25.320
hold on to the Rope that's in the cave guys hold on to the Rope it's the drugs

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:31.679
drug Origins thessally is known for having the most Bountiful Supply

00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:36.380
of extremely toxic drugs

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:44.100
that's where all the witches come from right why because it's where they get

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:51.059
their things right it's where they get their craft right as soon as your Market as soon as your Market goes to Rome you get all

00:18:51.059 --> 00:18:57.360
this stuff in Rome you got witches in Rome you got witches in Rome picking up dead bodies not picking them up but from

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:03.600
the pile where they put them after the circus um taking their organs and harvesting

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:11.340
why for the sake of chemistry dote and antidote right we have sources that say the

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:17.280
beginning of medicine the very the very beginning of medicine the beginning of

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:24.840
medicine is not uh Hippocrates right what's going on a

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:30.200
thousand years before Hippocrates dote and antidote

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:36.480
experimentation with toxins these are cultures that have way more

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:42.179
knowledge way more knowledge about human physiology than you understand

00:19:42.179 --> 00:19:50.179
or that we've been led to believe yeah they're actually engineering people with

00:19:50.179 --> 00:19:56.059
polypharmaceutical compounds fantastic okay so

00:19:56.059 --> 00:20:04.799
polypharmacy is one of the things that we want to talk about you can talk about treating treating illness or condition

00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:11.100
by means of a drug and you can add many drugs to it and have polypharmacy have a

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:19.080
multi-pronged level fighting of medicine there's another layer there's a higher dimension

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:24.360
there's the next step up and that's what we're doing tonight

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:30.000
is showing you how not to treat the person

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.660
with the drug but to give the person the drug

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:42.299
whose body will then become the dispenser

00:20:42.299 --> 00:20:47.460
of the communion this brings health

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:53.419
and Youth yeah

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:59.760
yeah that is this why Cersei and the god of

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:07.260
healing share the same epithet polifarmacon

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:12.720
yeah polypharmacy it's the way to go there's a we'll get to the 3D model I

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:18.240
want to get to that next let's go to the next source I wanted to throw this gent in this

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:26.100

melanous yeah who is the oyster bolon who is the Archer

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:08.820

this man Mela nails he isn't a man who is

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:23.760
given over inspirationally a man who enters into a state

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:31.860
that state they call the eremon and I'm about to show you the link but who enters into a state by means of

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:37.980
the ostrus he specifically names the substance the compound that they're

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:43.440
using yeah the oysters by using the oistress

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:49.740

wandering wealth mind wandering wealth

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:07.080
yeah so um we have these bow people

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:14.039
who are associated with colors and drugs let's look next Passage

00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:20.640
this is great and great let's let's close in I just want to look at you Donut oh that verb for what the

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:26.520
gentleman was in when he was a state this drug state is that shaken driven

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:33.720
inspiration that buzz that buzz and they use this verb with

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.960
another next with another phrase

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:49.320
overcome inspirationally overcome pharmacologically by Eros

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:55.860
take take that down should we overcome One Moment by the Eros and they

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:01.440
are talking about a drug you're talking about psychedelics

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:08.940
I'm talking about that Realm that they will take you to and they had

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:16.080
an expression overcome by this Eros what is this Eros

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:22.320
um imagine a remember that Eros is an Archer whose arrows

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:31.020
are able to do two things to attract or repel and the power is was considered to do

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.059
that was considered a cosmic power

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:45.360
let's see the compulsion and I want I want you to watch this I'm going to show it to you twice and I'm going to ask you

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.700
a different question both times this time I want you to look

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:56.940
for the god of compulsion that is in this

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:02.120
um in this document

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:09.140
of the phenomenon that happened in recent history

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:30.930
[Music]

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:41.220
[Music] foreign

00:25:42.760 --> 00:26:19.420
[Music]

00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:22.919
foreign

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:35.460
so that was the accusation right Bacchus always brings to Aphrodite and it's

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:42.240
entering a state I know that wasn't what you were expecting but that state was a

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:48.900
drug influenced State a religious expression

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:54.779
brought to you by the miracle of your own body's drugs

00:26:54.779 --> 00:27:02.039
the idea behind the mystery is not producing a drug and getting it into an

00:27:02.039 --> 00:27:08.520
organism the idea is taking over that organism's

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.559
body to produce the effects

00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:20.460
that you desire and if you are one of those lucky people

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:28.158
to have gone through the process into have seen what they all see

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:36.539

language no theories here to argue I have no theories put down your

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:50.878
pitchfork be honest yes right what's the evidence the

00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:56.220
evidence is that there's a lot of drugs and dyes and funny things going on here

00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:03.359
what happens to this um woman yeah she's uh oh what is she she's

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:18.200
these baton these

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:24.780
abominable purgations these these these

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:31.020
running oh substances that flood out when you

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:37.560
have catharsis she's got that oh yeah thanks Chewie by the way the

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:44.640
drinking cup of they're using it notice that it's a drinking cup or wine cup in the beginning and but then number two is

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:51.000
the cop of the Eucharist right so this same word is being used for very very

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:58.740
specific mystery religion purposes yeah okay and then we look look at the

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:06.720
next I believe we've got another definition yeah [Music] Abomination these are those off-runnings

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.319
what are this these the Abominations of the Abominations

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:21.720
excuse me you guys recognize that from eremon this is just eres Moses right an

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:27.859
abstract noun it is the Wilderness these

00:36:27.859 --> 00:36:34.020
right these abominable things produce this

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:40.020
off running this catharsis bring the text up one more time this this drawing

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:45.660
away right of the things that are

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:53.400
that are unclean right what are they what's their source

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:59.940
there's a nice genitive there taste pornos I'll taste all right where are we getting these

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:05.700
Runnings these pollutions these abominable things we're getting it from

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:12.000
her pornea from her pornea

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.060
okay I wanted people to see a poly

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:23.700
pharmaceutical operation here tonight I wanted them to see the preparation of

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:29.640
the cup and that the process here is taking the

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:35.640
individual and transforming the individual

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:43.859
so that the individual can then transform others around them

00:37:43.859 --> 00:37:49.079
yeah it's a brilliant brilliant use of

00:37:49.079 --> 00:37:54.300
pharmacology you're not trying to fight the disease

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.040
you're not trying to fight the disease

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:06.300
but outside of that beyond that you are trying to tune

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:12.900
the body you are trying to tend the body so that

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:21.260
the body becomes itself the administrator of the communion

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:29.880
and this process which is described um that length is the mystery

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:36.300
that ultimately comes down to you when you hear a Christian say you know

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:42.060
celebrations or it is a mystery they're not saying it the same way they don't

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:47.460
know that any of that background is back there it's sitting right in front of them right I mean look at this we're

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:53.520
just reading out of the Bible right it's there all you have to do is pull it out give

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:59.119
me that last quote please Chewie in yeah

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:04.260
there was a name written on her head What's that name a lot of people oh the

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:10.619
translations screw this up so bad right musterion was hurt

00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:15.660
and that was the name and then after it we have a kind of a

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:23.599
lengthy description of what that musterion means that musterion is

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:28.160
Babylon hemegales

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:39.300
that is the mother the great mother

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:44.339
we are in March in a few uh in just a few days they'll

00:39:44.339 --> 00:39:49.859
be celebrating in Rome of 2000 years ago

00:39:49.859 --> 00:39:56.839
they will be celebrating then the rights of this very same Divinity

00:39:56.839 --> 00:40:02.660
you missed the title like some of my students got it but

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:09.599
the titles that you have of Jesus right all you have to do is plug them in and

00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:14.720
find them in the mystery religions of the pagans that were happening 1600 to

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:22.560
2600 years previously and you'll find that those are very

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:29.400
specific deities very specific functions right the savior who is the savior

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:36.119
right it's it's um it's the language that'll show you that reality and that's what I hope to

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:25.980
Lady Babylon I want to start with Neil I want to start with Neil and as we bring

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:32.640
on Neil I want to say Neil could you please tell me the impression of a man

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:39.900
who truly honors the museum yeah you couldn't have said it any

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:48.300
better when you said it's not just about taking the drug it's about the rights it's about the the

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:53.760
uh the action so I'm going to give you an example first of all it's one of the point something out real quick the uh

00:43:53.760 --> 00:44:02.160
the the plant that the roots are cut from that have the highest content of DMT which is Acacia also happens to

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:08.700
produce a blood red dye I wonder if that's a coincidence or not but that's all in our topic for another day I have

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:15.720
a quick passage that I want to read that just highlights what you said if you don't mind it's five seconds long it's

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:21.839
about Alexander the Great from Aryan okay this is from Aryan book five uh

00:44:21.839 --> 00:44:27.420
chapter 2 verses five through seven they're in India Alexander is all the

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:33.599
way to the other side of the continent and all of his men are kind of getting tired and they're kind of losing

00:44:33.599 --> 00:44:39.060
confidence all of a sudden a sudden desire this is why I'm this is why I'm

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:44.640
rocking the ivy diadem you're gonna see why it's not about just the drug it's about putting on the diet and listen to

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:50.640
this a sudden desire sees Alexander to visit a certain

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:57.180
Memorial of Dionysus that the nissians boasted in India he went to mount meros

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:04.020
with his companions and the Infantry and he saw the mountain abounded with Ivy

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:10.619
and Laurel and the Groves of all kind it was thickly shaded and had a manner of

00:45:10.619 --> 00:45:15.780
wild beasts to hunt the macedonians glad to see the ivy

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:21.480
which is on my head right now uh for a long time as there was none else in India

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:28.740
and not else where there and not elsewhere there's Vines either eagerly they fashioned the REITs and Don them at

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:35.359
once and saying dionysus's Praises calling on the God by his various names

00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:40.740
Alexander's sacrificed there to Dionysus and feasted with his companions some

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:47.579
have reported the Inner Circle the initiates having crowned themselves

00:45:47.579 --> 00:45:54.000
with the ivy invoked the god were possessed by Dionysus honored him with

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.380
cries of Eva Eva yake and flew into a bakic frenzy

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:06.440
that's Aryan awesome awesome awesome

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:12.359
area look at that man dredge up that's a servant of the Muse that's a serving The

00:46:12.359 --> 00:46:20.819
Muse that'll dredge up a dead guy like that and say speak to us that's necromancy I love it Neil I love it Neil

00:46:20.819 --> 00:46:26.460
Snappy give us your impression or your two cents on tonight

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:32.579
what I keep thinking about and I keep coming back to is this the drugs cause

00:46:32.579 --> 00:46:37.740
us to die right they take you to that moment and what's clear to me is that

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:43.079
orgasmos and that death moment are the same the point is to die and then extend

00:46:43.079 --> 00:46:48.839
that right to it's like this Paradox you see the same thing in the myth of the

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:55.380
core right she gets sacrificed in that destruction is is it's both a horrendous

00:46:55.380 --> 00:47:01.319
loss but an infinite gain it's where we see that Paradox of uh the goddesses

00:47:01.319 --> 00:47:07.859
power at play right it's both creation and destruction it's that cosmogonic arrows like you were describing with the

00:47:07.859 --> 00:47:12.960
arrows right both the force of division and the force of return happening at

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:19.260
once that's what I got brilliant Brilliance okay for anybody who was able

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:27.480
to keep up with that Brilliance um I particularly like the idea that you have those opposites because that is so

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:33.780
both that destruction and that creation because that is so orific

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:40.800
um okay that's gonna bring me to question number two for you Snappy but Rob question question number one yeah

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:48.359
your thoughts tonight um your two cents I hope you're I hope you're fired up

00:47:48.359 --> 00:47:55.079
no I'm not fired up at all I'm here for the drugs that's what that that's two years ago today well not

00:47:55.079 --> 00:48:02.940
today two years ago either today or yesterday I initiated a quest for these drugs

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:08.220
that's where I wanna I wanna find these drugs I uh listen to the part you

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:13.500
podcast on sacred speaks and from that point on I've been trying to find these

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:19.859
drugs and trying to understand these mystery rights and I can't explain there's loads of

00:48:19.859 --> 00:48:24.960
theories there's lots to discuss but I can't I can't I can't Define them

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:30.119
all we can do is look at the sources and where we're getting

00:48:30.119 --> 00:48:35.520
these drugs from because these drugs are from the ancient world we need to look at the ancient sources that's what

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:41.040
you're doing and I love it I can't I can't I can't say any any more than that I haven't got any profound

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:48.960
comment on that's where my standpoint is on that

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:54.119
question fantastic fantastic so that's nice look

00:48:54.119 --> 00:49:00.720
you've shown where the draw is right you came here for the drugs in the first place you wanted to see the history you

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:05.819
wanted to you know you wanted the reality totally respectable okay I have

00:49:05.819 --> 00:49:13.020
a question for everybody and then I'm just going to let people throw out what they want um Snappy and I were talking a little

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:18.660
bit earlier about the the connection you know

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:24.240
um Neil mentioned it very very nicely um with his little episode with

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:31.560
Alexander that was a nice cut into this but we have this thing between East and West right it seems to follow like a

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:38.099
pattern of um the transmission of knowledge and of drugs right

00:49:38.099 --> 00:49:44.460
um can you tell us something about just mention I know it's not everybody's area of expertise right I just want to you

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:52.020
know discuss how about some gypsies perhaps Snappy yeah right so one thing that and when

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:59.220
anamon and I were talking earlier we were going over like I'm going to be doing an episode on my podcast with Dion

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:07.440
where we're going to be breaking down the tire mystery which is connected to Hercules and is connected to the cult of

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:13.140
Mary Salome and to the Phoenicians and uh eventually it winds up making its way

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:19.020
to Alexandria and it makes its way eventually to Spain what's interesting

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:26.280
about all of this is you also have the gypsies following a very or the Roma people also following a very similar

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:31.500
kind of trajectory so the story goes and some archaeological evidence to support

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:38.099
this as well is that um most of the aroma people are employed by Alexander the Great and are brought

00:50:38.099 --> 00:50:44.880
to Alexandria to be musicians and then later on there's a diaspora and they're

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:51.420
forced out of Alexandria and they wind up making their way to Spain and all of this becomes really significant because

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:57.420
we also have uh the labors of Hercules which talk about Cadiz and the pillars

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:04.680
and they recently just found a temple to Hercules in 2022 you know so and it goes

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:10.140
right back to what you were saying with the with the castle magic as well it like it there's so much of a deep

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:17.700
connection here and there's all of this thing with the trade routes in the the this Tyrion purple and how it makes its

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:23.460
way across the Mediterranean basically yeah it's there's something about that

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:28.980
die cartel you know what I mean that's transmitting along with it

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:35.280
um this kind of spirit this bachic spirit with it yes um I see Neil is

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:42.000
waving his drugs in the air right it's fantastic that the the group because they talk

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.520
about the root Cutters and the sources it's all root Cutters media sir just happens to be

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:53.520
the the plant in South America and in Tibet that has the highest num

00:51:53.520 --> 00:52:00.119
percentage of DMT content also produces a red blood red dye it makes you wonder

00:52:00.119 --> 00:52:07.940
was this this is this another species of the same thing that these sources are writing about they describe it to a T

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:13.680
Roots cut that produce dye and psychedelic experiences

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:19.319
it's too it's identical now Neil explained to explain the uh the audience

00:52:19.319 --> 00:52:24.420
please um you're talking about the acacia root which is what you're yeah what you're

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:29.780
which is perfectly legal people so it is

00:52:30.119 --> 00:52:38.160
so you're talking about kind of a complex um but doable chemistry there

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:43.500
um uh fantastic and all right what do you think then of the Dyers you know

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:49.020
we've had these descriptions of The Phoenician eyes and the mouth being dyed

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:56.099
right like they're exposing themselves yeah and oh it doesn't the experience

00:52:56.099 --> 00:53:02.700
it's not I'm not just talking about when you went to a party each other you took a couple hits mushrooms and you the room

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:08.760
looked cool and there were some the walls are breathing I'm not talking about that I'm talking about literally

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:15.000
being in another dimension I'm not saying that figuratively you

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.760
literally go somewhere else and you literally will speak to something I don't know whether you want to call it

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:27.300
a god you want to call it it's something else that literally will happen I don't care what you believe in that could happen

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:32.940
it's fact so Neil how does that how do we integrate that into medicine then

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:39.000
because that's where the um science is going how do you bring this all down

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:46.260
into you know the therapeutic world can can we resurrect these riots because

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:51.300
these are ancient healing rights can we resurrect these rights is there you know

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:56.880
should we be looking into how to do this as far as I know it's been healing

00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:03.960
people's depression long term as far as I know I haven't heard of any any downsides at all yet as far as I'm

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:10.260
talking like in controlled settings and and people doing not just going crazy and doing their people doing this for

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:16.619
real and being serious and being appropriate with it as far as I know it's people when that's been done the right way it's been 100 right perfect

00:54:16.619 --> 00:54:24.900
there's been nothing no overdoses enough just people being healed depression oh

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:32.780
you know mental health issues all all types of wide-ranging things even people becoming more alert and more

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:38.520
enlightened as it results changing like life-changing stuff okay so here's my

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:43.800
question based on that here's my question for everybody and we'll finish with this

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:52.319
um watching Elvis and watching that spell that takes place if we were to combine

00:54:52.319 --> 00:54:58.500
here's my question can we combine sexuality

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:04.980
with psychedelic drug use to achieve healing

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:10.380
yeah and just real quick I know I keep talking but you the sexuality part is

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:17.579
important because it's not just about taking the substance it's about playing the part it's about the music it's about

00:55:17.579 --> 00:55:23.640
the atmosphere it's about meditation it's about how you enter the state so

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:30.240
you don't you the drug doesn't do all the work for you you do half the work by getting into that state

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:36.660
so yes yeah I was just gonna basically go I'll go along those lines what's key here is

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:43.020
the image right one of the most important things like you can't just be having the drugs without the image

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:48.540
itself it's the image that we're trying to invoke that's going to take us through the right and if you look at the

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:54.720
rights there's all this procession right it's not enough to Simply die you have to die and be reborn and then you have

00:55:54.720 --> 00:56:00.300
to invoke that image that everyone sees right like this is the key here and what

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:05.640
I also want to highlight is just that we see a lot of these kind of mysteries surviving and healing people in our

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:11.460
modern day like we can look at Ayahuasca we can look at ibogain and while they're

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:18.300
different and they're not the same there is a there is a healing aspect that is survived and there is a transformative

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:24.480
kind of death and rebirth that happens that these people go through there is a communication with the ancestors it's a

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:30.960
similar kind of process and I think like the more we learn to understand these drugs and approach this scientifically

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:38.720
we can try to recreate that and understand what this experience even really truly is

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:46.319
nice nice Rob you've got the last response we're talking drugs cult and

00:56:46.319 --> 00:56:53.900
sex it's all yours oh that's a good book the the the the

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:59.520
eyes and the mouth for you yeah um

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:04.859
what what can you see what what can you do with

00:57:04.859 --> 00:57:10.380
with this what what are the possibilities among that that's I'm I've

00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:17.040
got a question not not a response I've got a question what are the possibilities of resurrecting this right

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:23.339
because there's no doubt there's no doubt we're getting um positive responses with psychedelic treatments no

00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:30.359
doubt especially in uh PST in post-traumatic stress

00:57:30.359 --> 00:57:36.420
for sure we definitely again and then end of life there's terrific results

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:43.200
there isn't a complete across the board such as the the there is there are other

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:51.240
aspects to it which I'm not going to go into but this what we discuss and the mystery and

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.400
and the riots in the mystery is is like a ladder there's there's ladders that

00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:01.859
you climb there's like um so you go the Alice in your Mysteries you'll go and

00:58:01.859 --> 00:58:08.940
perform those rights and the Very the The Very Organized and the kind of

00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:16.980
guaranteed to have this mystical experience you kind of guaranteed to go there and nobody ever complains not put

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:22.559
it that way and everybody like going um but that's not exactly the cave of

00:58:22.559 --> 00:58:27.900
draconius there's there's different places that you'll go to and there's different levels and different

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:33.660
experiences from what I can gather I'm I'm not sure that it's just one simple

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:40.260
method I think you've got like you've got different psychedelics at play you've got different you've got lsds

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:47.339
lsas you've got salocybin you've got DMT you you've got different drugs that are

00:58:47.339 --> 00:58:53.040
being formulated in an ancient setting in an ancient world now that can't you

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:59.760
can't arrive at that with the Modern Chemistry that we've got I can't get there with the Modern Chemistry we've

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:06.720
got I'm trying we're trying to get there and we need some serious assistance we

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:12.960
need by biochemical assistance to resurrect this right that's what we

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:18.540
require and that's where we need to go into and get kind of some professional

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:24.180
advice from somebody in these fields that we need to go into you know you're

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:30.420
not going to get there unless you you're getting this help from somebody out there we need we need this help in my

00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:35.640
opinion but it's a very interesting scenario because

00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:42.240
the mystery that we discussed that we are discussing the the mystery that galen's describing the mystery that

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:47.760
might is going on in Gethsemane these these these rights what we're

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:56.160
talking about um are rather different to the alisanian Mysteries they're under the Mysteries

00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:04.380
but I think the separate ones I think um Dionysus represents a different type of

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:09.960
mystery with romeoce I think that weird means a heck of a lot and I'd like to

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:15.839
investigate that I'd like to go into it which brings me to an announcement of a

01:00:15.839 --> 01:00:23.460
Discord um I'm going to be as quick as I can but the Discord if you find the Discord

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:30.299
then you might be on the Discord I'm gonna leave it at that what I'm going to show you is it took me a while

01:00:30.299 --> 01:00:38.760
um two years ago I'll show the sacred speech podcast so I'd try and I I I spent three days in

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:45.420
frantic research I arrived at a boy called talisforos and I wanted to

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:51.420
contact Aman and it was uncontactable you couldn't get hold of him no it was virtually

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:57.540
impossible there was no web search there was no way you could go to find him and I had to find him and I found him and

01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:03.480
I'm here today and I'd suggest and I hope anybody who wants to get to the

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:09.059
Discord is either there already or knows the way and and I'm gonna leave it at that with

01:01:09.059 --> 01:01:16.260
the Discord I don't cause any controversy with this it's an investigation into what these episodes

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:22.619
produced I'll leave it there thank you fantastic so Rob
