Harlot or prostitute okay I get it arilus but most importantly people I

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.720
tell all my Greek students this and please if you're learning anything in the Greek know that that verbal action

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:16.080
is most important right the Greek is basing the majority of those n those

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.840
nouns and adjectives off of that action so let's look at what the verb is go to

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.520
the next one yep um this is not the verb but this is

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:33.919
the um this is a noun ponos catamite look at this it's from that porn root

00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:39.799
it's from that porn root right sodomite and again everybody saw we were

00:18:39.799 --> 00:18:47.440
looking at Sodom the English term sodomite we know what the English term sodomite means it means somebody's H you

idolator you see this is a pagan this is a real Pagan thing we got going on

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:11.159
here's the verb that it's from parami right right and just look at the bottom

00:19:11.159 --> 00:19:17.720
of this paragraph it's the second to last line to export for sale in Epic usually of exporting

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:26.440

erotic sales prostitution you mean the words that that we're getting all of these

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:52.679
Concepts from in Greek have to do with this idea that the leace has that you can

00:19:52.679 --> 00:20:00.360
take a person capture them sail off to somewhere else and sell them for the

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:06.919
sake of sexual favors as a slave yes yes

00:20:06.919 --> 00:20:14.000

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:14.120
really great um wonderful description of these people um that I'm going to read

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:20.200
to you from Antiquity um uh but here I want to bring that back up please chewy

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:27.240
um I just want you to remember the verb poro that means to prostitute also means

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:34.960
to practice idolatry at the bottom the religion is just um wound up with it you

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.360
can't separate the to a poropos is one who has Commerce with

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.760
prostitutes the roots of this are ex you know endless this is one source I wanted

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:53.400
to see to bring you look what do we have here we have hus now I'm gonna give you I'm GNA give you something special right

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:59.720
I'm going to give you something special tonight your average scholar is not going to do this they're not going to go

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:07.039
all the way into the depths what I have to do is dig up a

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:14.000
lexicographer who's Greek an ancient Greek lexicographer who's going to be able to

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.760
write to you what these words mean in his own

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:28.440
language right that is evidence that is the cream of the crop that is that

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:37.960
bottle of wine that's been sitting there for 120 years yeah that's the good stuff that's

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:44.919
the good stuff let's go right now to him let's go here's two

00:23:44.919 --> 00:23:50.240
words poropos and poroi which is just the

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:57.520
they're just putting some stuff into a case don't worry about that it's just pornos anyway what is the poropos it's

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:05.480
the hyot tropos the hyot tropos remember Jesus has hyro these little guys who

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:12.840
were his companions all the time this is the one who Grooms them this is the

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:20.880
companion groomer and the poros he is himself a

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:28.440
poros so when Jesus talks to his children and he is telling them

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:36.840
about um what they will be doing he's approaching them as the groomer as the

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:45.919
one who cultivates their active use as prostitutes he is the poros he's the if

00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:51.600
you want to think of him as the ideal pornos that's the way to go but that is

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:58.760
the position from which Jesus is speaking to his young apostles

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:04.559
okay um poro look at the bottom definition P now this one I'm going to

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:09.799
translate directly up for anybody who's been saying these kids these kids are

00:25:09.799 --> 00:25:15.880
not not kids who were kids these are 30-year-old kids right and the only

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:23.399
reason he's calling him kids is Jesus is Goofy right he walks around like Mickey Mouse saying W there chitty

00:25:23.399 --> 00:25:30.600
kitties where are all my sheepkin today hello there he does that to adults cuz he's just

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:37.720
weird that way right it's just one of the thing no no that's not right that's

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:45.760
not right at all what is the

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:54.600
definition according to hisus hius yeah this is that

00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:01.600
pice that has grown to the point of fruition to the point of

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:11.440
fruiting that's literally what it says Ros that kid is at the point of blooming

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:16.880
and at that point of blooming they are entered

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.520
into working for the tones the one who collects the fees and that one who

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.000
collects the fees is strictly working the business

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:37.200
end of those um hamaro yeah yeah okay let's keep going

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:43.520
it gets it's going to get a little bit more um historic detail here love it

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:49.120
this is great literature people the Bible is you need to read this stuff go

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:55.799
um this is ciceros oh yes this is calinar and conspiracy and I just want

00:26:55.799 --> 00:27:03.360
you guys to see I want to read this to you cheie you've been great can you blow that up for me thanks um look look at

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:10.080
the second look at the second paragraph he's talking about the calinar and conspiracy this is just where cisero's

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.159
Consul was somebody else there's two of them right and um somebody comes up and

00:27:15.159 --> 00:27:20.240
tries to take over Cataline tries to take over the government Cicero is not

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:27.039
going to let him he's promis he pledges to protect the Republic to keep the Republic safe from an attempted

00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:32.600
conspiracy from an an an attempted um Insurrection

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:38.279
and so um he talks about the people who were following Cataline he talks about

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:44.799
the people who are following Cataline and in the second paragraph he says there is a last class lasts not only in

00:27:44.799 --> 00:27:49.880
number but in the sword of men and in their way of life the special bodyguard

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:55.279
of Cataline his go his bodyguard and he levied it yes the friends of his

00:27:55.279 --> 00:28:02.600
Embraces and of his bosom what whom you see with carefully combed hair glossy

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:09.600
beardless or with well-trimmed beards watch watch out if you trim your

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:16.200
beard too well you might be a calinar um let's see what does he mean

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:23.679
with tunics with sleeves he describes their fashion right um whose watchfulness is expended in suppers

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:29.960
lasting until Daybreak he goes on to say they have their naked dances together

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:36.840
and then it takes a funny Kind of a Funny turn yeah I'm sorry let's get the next one up takes kind of a funny turn

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:42.919
and he continues to describe him in these bands remember this is Cicero people if you don't like sis if you

00:28:42.919 --> 00:28:48.000
don't like Uh siso something's wrong something's wrong you know I feel like I

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:57.360
should salute a eagle or something yeah um ciso uh in these bands are all the Gam

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:03.640
um lers right now remember they're using the same terms for these groups of

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:11.200
people that Jesus in the New Testament is using of his disciples okay in these

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:17.399
bands are all the gamblers all the adulterers all the unclean and Shameless

00:29:17.399 --> 00:29:24.360
citizens these boys so witty and delicate have learned not only to love

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:30.679
and to be loved not only to sing and dance but also to brandish daggers and

00:29:30.679 --> 00:29:39.440
to administer poisons and unless they are driven out unless they die even should Cataline die

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:47.360
I warn you that the school of Cataline would exist in the Republic yeah yeah look at the last line

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:54.399
Second um second uh starts on the third last line oh War much to be dreaded when

00:29:54.399 --> 00:29:59.919
Cataline is going to have his bodyguard of

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:07.799
prostitutes yeah if you are looking at Antiquity and you do not see the

00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:14.600
profound effect of human trafficking um and it's broad

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:21.720
cultural um profusion entering all of literature

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.919
doesn't matter what kind it is there's a reason that Christians call

00:30:26.919 --> 00:30:32.279
them slaves right there's a

00:30:32.279 --> 00:30:38.919
reason there's a reason okay let's keep going after

perpetuates the lies and the propaganda of those who don't want reality who

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:02.160
whoever is in our society who does not want a

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:09.119
reality of Jesus as he lived and spoke and breathed

00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:16.319
historically they have a problem with this we we can always win people we can

00:36:16.319 --> 00:36:22.359
always win as long as we get people the information the people who should be

00:36:22.359 --> 00:36:31.520
reading the Bible right now are not preachers and pulpits they're not priests in parishes no they're not

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:39.319
Street Preachers no they're not anglicans no they're not Protestants

they're not Catholics they're not orange or green they're not even

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:50.720
Mormons the people who should be teaching Jehovah's Witness I'll throw

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:56.240
them in too sorry about that don't mean to leave anybody out scientologists don't teach the Bible so they don't

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:03.440
count right but for those who teach the Bible the the ones that really should be

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:09.079
taking their place are the scholars and I'm not talking about the people at

00:37:09.079 --> 00:37:16.480
Harvard I'm talking about the people who spent time in their lives saying there

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:23.560
is this thing called language and you know what I'm going to master to the

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:29.760

that Gateway to reality that is the past all we have

00:38:00.599 --> 00:38:10.640
to do is bring these texts to the world the whole world should see Jesus for who

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:18.680
he is and he was a man arrested in a park with a naked boy for a reason for a

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:24.960
reason it's all about that museum we have to maintain

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:31.599
the Integrity of the museum um I've got a couple more but I think I'm just gonna hit this last one yep I'm taking up

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:36.800
people's time um yeah no no no this is

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:43.960
just when Jesus boat jaacks Peter I'm sorry Peter remember

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:50.680
um Peter James and John were on these

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:57.880
boats in Sea of Galilee right on the shore of the Sea of Galilee and they're

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:04.960
parents go away to menend the Nets and when Jesus sees the parents leave he

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:11.480
goes over to the boat that's got Peter on it and he says hey take us up to the

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:19.040
Shoreline and I'll teach these people on the shore and they do and when they're done teaching Jesus turns back to Peter

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:27.280
and he says hey Peter let's go out into the deep end let's go let's go see what's going on

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:35.000
over there and it's at that point after the Miracles have taken place that Peter
