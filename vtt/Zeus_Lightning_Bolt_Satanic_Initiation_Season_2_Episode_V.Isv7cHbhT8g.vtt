thank you for coming back to Lady Babylon tonight we have a great great

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.960
topic to cover we're going to be looking at Maya the midwife

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.460
and our goal is to bring her into the present that's right to reach from the past from

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.600
the future and bring the mogustokia to life

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.500
beautiful stuff

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.629
[Music]

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
foreign

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.700
I've got a video for you tonight about our topic that's just laced with the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.240
most beautiful subliminal messaging my compliments tonight to Chewie

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.299
um what I'd like to do is I'd like to just jump into a ship here and get you

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.720
know let's just get things going uh there's no reason to mess around tonight let's go right back I want to take you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.780
right back to a guy named nonas and I want to pull his ghost out of the Grave

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.820
um and just so you can put him somewhere in history we're talking about the transition between

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:07.259
Roman rule and Christian rule and there there is a big difference we are living

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.560
now we land our ship and we get out of it and we realize oh we are living now

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.920
at that crossover when people are afraid to publish

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.800
because the Christian authorities will not only burn their work but will burn

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.920
them so we are dealing with a phenomenon called crypto pagans and that's what I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.040
want to do is I want to take you tonight to see a crypto Pagan his name is known

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.400
as and he is able to publish the longest

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.420
Epic in Greek the longest the longest by far

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.760
and that epic is about Dionysus

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.739
an epic about Dionysus

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.239
and to start that epic off we have to start at the heart of the cult of

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:17.060
Dionysus and that heart that inner sanctuary

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.900
is the mogusto Kia that is what is that that is the pain

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.340
of birth that is the pain that one feels while giving birth there's a special

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.360
word for it the birth Pang is usually how it's translated it's never Pleasant

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.980
never Pleasant always painful it's a portal a doorway

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.080
and this Maya watches over that doorway

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.360
she brings the living

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.500
from that dark Death so just to explain to all the Christians

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.659
that we have invited to come in and please continue inviting particularly evangelicals because there

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:19.260
is a need right now for evangelicals to see the work that we are doing and for those of you who have come

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:26.639
tonight I want to say we're tracking Jesus we're following Jesus last week we looked at

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:35.699
him in the apocalypse and we found out we we found out that um his face

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:43.460
glowed as Helios we saw that gown he was wearing

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.280
we saw the wig the white wig and we understood

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.860
he is the Christos yes now we're going to look at the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:07.139
reason we're trait we're tracking that naked boy that was with Jesus when he was arrested we want to ultimately

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.979
solve that issue historically and put it to bed so the people 2000 years ago can

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:20.759
Excuse Me 2 000 years from now can um can be able to say hey look what uh

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.880
look at these people looking at the reality right that's all we ask just look at the reason

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.460
so tonight we're going to track him through Maya and in order to do that we're going to track this naked boy

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.000
through mine yes you're going to see him there you're going to see the cult and for those of you who have ears to hear

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.400
you will see the portrait of the Christ that you have never seen before this is

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.440

cast it out yes beautiful the music was great by the way

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:20.160
um and what happens so Zeus takes him and sews him up right because she is

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.980
birthing via simulator's birthing via the lightning

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:32.179
via the lightning and the first time we see in line five

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:42.000
when Zeus intervenes and he removes the moisture

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.480
from simile and exposes her to that lightning to

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:55.140
that fire that great sun fire she is consumed

00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:01.500
she is consumed and what this process Lacks

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:07.860
is the Maya there is no Maya and Nona says that

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:14.820
right this artificial practice that maintains the power of the jov or

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:20.900
the Jehovah I don't care if you say yoga or if you say I don't care and then everybody says

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:26.880
don't say it it's the same God the Father

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:32.580
and he keeps screwing up he keeps screwing up

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:39.240
he's the oldest liar yes check the Bible people my evangelicals who have shown up

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.400
today graciously ask yourself why it is that God is the first liar

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:50.220
yeah we're talking here about the family

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:55.440
of the flip side of the flip pole we're talking about the morning Stars

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:01.080
we're talking about the morning Stars okay keep reading we're going there we'll get there

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:06.419
so line five that's where we are without the Maya

00:22:06.419 --> 00:22:13.200
by the way ladies who are doulas out there and I know that you've identified yourselves before

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:20.720
um I something that I thought was very interesting that you may have a better perception understanding of is that Maya

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:27.659
the name of the Goddess it's a name Maya and her name means her craft

00:22:27.659 --> 00:22:33.299
that's how we say Midwife is Maya Maya

00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:38.460
um what I thought was interesting was she is the only Olympian

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:44.940
she's the only God within the pantheon who prefers and chooses

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:50.419
to live on Earth in a cave

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:57.780
she's the only God that prefers to live in a in a mortal environment within the

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:05.280
cave and her son preserves that his messengering is all under her leadership

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:11.520
under her College so when you see the caduceus

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:17.220
with the two serpents and the rod you know

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:22.799
this is this is part of the college this is part of the College of The Midwives

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:29.100
now something very special I don't know what it means maybe somebody can tell me I don't know what it means that she is

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:36.659
the she is the one who prefers to live in the in the element if you will she couldn't

00:23:36.659 --> 00:23:41.940
she could be ethereal she chooses to be Ariel

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:49.399
yeah nice nice love it anyway let's keep reading Zeus makes himself the party

00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:58.500
He makes himself interestingly enough the father and the Queen Mother

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.720
the Queen Mother interesting okay let's keep let's keep

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.820
reading let's keep reading I've got a little bit more yeah why he knows of

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:15.780
another birth right everybody everybody's saying I forgot to tell you the gossip is coming through the sybils the Zeus

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:22.440
Jehovah jove the father God is is destined to be overthrown

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:28.159
right so this is what's perpetuating all of this action again

00:24:28.159 --> 00:24:34.500
evangelicals I'm talking to the people who are here who hear the analog

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:42.380
they hear the analog they know what's being said they can decode

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:51.419
from his Temple he becomes pregnant from his Temple is this thing called the

00:24:51.419 --> 00:24:59.820
temple yes the Temple of your head yes and from the Temple of his head

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:06.480
he pours out now this is funny that the translation that the Harvard people

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.840
use right is old and every time every time somebody can't the translator can't

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:20.640
figure out what notice is doing because nonus is using I'm filtering this out for you but notice is using words that

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:27.840
only appear those hypoxagoma they only appear once we only have this citation of and they're words that he is

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:34.080
obviously creating right A lot of them are words that he is obviously creating

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:40.320
but of the ones that aren't that aren't his working that they just happen to be hypoxicillin

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:46.260
those have a share in an Antiquity that we can't I mean those are the real finds

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:52.140
linguistically those are the jewels that are in it and every once in a while you come across one of those that gives you

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:58.559
an insight into the cult the cult operation and then you can see that mystery just a little bit more clearly

00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:08.400
and we have some of that here because Zeus on a contig them he sends out he emits

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:15.600
Athena he admits Dina emitz Athena and it's not just a sin

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:21.299
as you and I would think of to sin it means to send as in to push water or a

00:26:21.299 --> 00:26:26.400
fluid to push water to squirt

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:34.020
now he so in the mind of the ancient Greek Zeus is conveying

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:43.080
on and why is it why do we know that there are this is a sexual reference because she is considered the asporon

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:49.679
she is considered the seedless yeah she is considered the seedless she

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:54.900
Springs solely from that mind

00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:00.539
yeah and she is the ostratusan

00:27:00.539 --> 00:27:08.820
the one who brings the lightning the Astra pay is you'll notice is just

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:14.580
strappe right the asterian

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.360
is just the Str root in use

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:27.779
so here once again connected with the very power of God you all know that

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:34.620
lightning is connected with God whether you're reading the Old Testament or whether you're reading some Pagan works

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:39.960
right you know that that God the father is a god of lightning you didn't know

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:48.260
what the lightning was before now the lightning is that which bathes the most

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:56.580
bathes that process of the ultimate pain of birth of bringing that entity into

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:02.159
life right bringing life from death so Maya

00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:07.799
the Midwife becomes the one linchpin of the entire mystery it's the linchpin

00:28:07.799 --> 00:28:14.460
that the Christians removed right we know it's unfortunate we know

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:21.360
what happened was unfortunate that Jesus got caught in a public park with a naked boy and

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:27.120
arrested and condemned and yelled at by a mob and forced to go to death in the

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:33.179
place of a dude who they knew had killed someone yeah

00:28:33.179 --> 00:28:40.260
um so we're trying to find it's unfortunate that's how the circumstances ended up

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:49.620
and he ends up dying on the cross before his time right but he is that one

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:55.980
to whom is brought the drugs and the financing that he can carry the title of

00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:01.980
the Eason yes that he can be the Christos why

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:10.500
because the asterion has brought us to him because we followed the star

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:16.260
all right so um I want you to see the context and I

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:21.960
want you to remember I need we need to see a dance because we are at a place where we have to constantly remind

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:30.559
ourselves and this is good for the evangelicals as well as well and please invite your Evangelical friends please

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:36.240
we are at a place where we have to stop and say wait a minute

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:44.179
um let's just get a historical perspective here right who's the oldest goddess right who's the oldest Divinity

00:29:44.179 --> 00:30:04.740
is it Jehovah who is it [Music]

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:14.220
so from this lightning now you want those symbols you want the real ones you want the old ones right and that's what

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:21.020
we're all looking for and that's why we're pounding down the Aryan connection and the The

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:27.679
Archers The Archers who are on the scythian

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:33.179
steeps yeah what are we doing there we're living in

00:30:33.179 --> 00:30:39.240
a world with arrows and we're living in a world with poisons and we're transferring culture through these

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:45.840
migrations that we're having and some of it is ending up in this old old poetry

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:53.100
and somehow we're getting these lines we're getting these lines about these individuals

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:58.620
yeah yeah so where does that bring us where does

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:04.860
that bring us yeah we come to the source we have to have

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:10.980
the lightning we have to know what they're doing with the lightning we have

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:18.240
to have the wanna saw right we have to have that power

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:25.679
we have to find her and we have to bring her forward and in order to do so we have to go into

00:31:25.679 --> 00:31:31.320
the language and we have to pull out the very basic elements the scientific stuff

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:37.200
that's there you you guys have been following this and you many of you have

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.539
been tracking on the Discord and you're working with other sources and seeing

00:31:42.539 --> 00:31:50.279
seeing how the mystery is pursued across time and I'm hoping that with enough

00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:57.539
work we can elucidate a broader history of the working of the mystery instead of

00:31:57.539 --> 00:32:06.059
its hijacking by the dude Moses and it's hijacking by the dude Jesus but

00:32:06.059 --> 00:32:16.039
we can go back and we can see it in its original form and find that Maya what is the lightning

00:32:16.039 --> 00:32:24.179
that she Bears the infant in what is that balcic power why are we here

00:32:24.179 --> 00:32:29.399
for um for the goddess it's because of that

00:32:29.399 --> 00:32:36.960
power there was a river I want to finish tonight and I just want to encourage you to look at the river arithusa

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.600
um because she was a witness she didn't want to to succumb

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:49.500
to domination so she became a witness she flowed through the underworld and

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:56.159
saw the Korah the great Korra she saw her the cold one

00:32:56.159 --> 00:33:02.759
right she saw her and witnessed

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.880
her place as a queen she was the one who said Demeter you've

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:17.700
got to let these humans live you've got to let these humans live for one reason your daughter is a queen

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:25.019
and she is acting as a queen you can't stop that

00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:30.960
um and somehow somehow that women's cult

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:37.559
took that gym that beauty of Life of real life

00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:44.220
and wove it into the history wove it in and

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:51.360
made the world that you now look at and say um and say your Hail Marys

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:59.159
and receive your atonement and raise your hands and praise and

00:33:59.159 --> 00:34:04.260
worship and bring the offerings of your praise

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:10.679
to your God when you do that thing when you do those things now you're doing them within a container

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:16.138
that was made by a guy who was arrested in the public park with a naked boy we

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:23.000
need to bring this to the for the people who are sitting there who are actively

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.060

you have a responsibility to free the people who are in the middle of it you you cannot discriminate against people

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:48.378
