00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:16.319
peculiar feminine of that form Ponto and why is it peculiar because it

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:24.840
predates it predates the stuff that you're using oh so it's a feminine uh yeah just

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:32.080
like don't worry it's orphic uh Greek and it is just like the

Christ was not the first savior yeah he was also not the

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:51.280
first Ponto both of those forms are used

00:06:51.280 --> 00:07:00.680
earlier of a woman both of them it's not that the form is feminine

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:09.039

educated right you understand this is the cult this is the cult this is the

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.959
pre-christian orphic cult Bronze Age that you people had took over I'm

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:54.760
fourth line down look you know we've got the Ponto she is that one so when Jesus

00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:03.959

if aulus is to be believed it doesn't actually smell like

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:01.080
urine it smells like a brothel and if you think Nero was

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:07.559

later ugly ages stuff which is what I call the the um darkness of the

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:39.440
iron those were terrible times yeah and their architecture was terrible anyway

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:46.279
the good stuff that's underneath the really good stuff that those Canaanite dance floors that's what

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:51.799
we found Canaanite dance floor and those two guys got up one night after another

00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:57.679
I was sleep it's 2: am. I'm exhausted after carrying dirt all day long this

00:26:57.679 --> 00:27:04.840
guy sits up in bed and the guy that's sleeping there next to me his name's mosha and he just starts talking like a

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:11.120
like a growling mechanical dog I sounded like and I told him knock it off because

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:17.240
he was saying word stuff and I was like okay enough I thought he was joking or something you know it was weird but H

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:24.440
you know I don't know he's dreaming maybe anyway he runs off in the next day and has to be taken to a mental hospital

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:31.440
and another guy stays and next night that other guy um he did the same thing he and what was

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:38.080
funny uh and he ended up running off the next day the Israeli police went after

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.200
him but this is all in uh an excavation

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:50.039
involved with the side of Armageddon right so what I first thought was a joke

00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:58.120
I couldn't the second night when the guy did it the second night and he said the same things the first guy did

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:04.000
