00:20:51.240 --> 00:21:00.360
ready Cosmos Alon Alon so your sky and your Earth or

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.480
uranos and Guy Gaia or gay right and

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:11.640
what are they doing what are they doing they're sooning they're soon toing what does

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:18.440
that mean on um we'll see okay we'll see and what about the whole Cosmos I didn't

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.760
hear a cosmos in the King James translation what's the cosmos how did

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:29.520
that get in there okay let's go see right now for the first first time what

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.679
this is saying go to the next one the next one uh

00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:40.080
yep yeah here's our verb what does it mean

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:46.400
to do this thing next one um well look it comes from tto Toto right and here

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:53.120
are all the meanings for Toto for to to finish right to finish look down here to

00:21:53.120 --> 00:22:00.080
fulfill right to bring in completion people I just want to sit for a minute I

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:06.159
want you to look at this thing and I want you to notice all of all of this

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:13.520
blue does everybody see all of that blue do you know what those are those are

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:20.000
texts those are other Greeks who are writing before anybody else has even

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:28.480
thought about genres of literature uhhuh yeah yeah very very

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.520
very look at these sources do you see all of these blue things are sources

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.600
look at how big the Greek the ancient Greek

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:46.840
linguistic umph is look at how big it is this is the first page for this one verb

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:55.120
that is the core of the verb that you and I are looking at my God is it complex or what watch

00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:02.000
watch how the Hebrews unable to capture it and I'll show you a linguistic trick

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:10.000
that shows that the Hebrew is actually an attempt to back translate the

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:19.039
Greek oh fantastic fantastic let's go to the

00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:27.320
next one uhhuh next one wherever we yep yep here is the verb in Hebrew are you

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:33.760
ready yeah Kal right to what to be complete to

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:41.480
be at an end to be finished to be accomplished or to be spent to be spent

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:48.720
okay to be finished or accomplished now um how did the how where were we in the

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:56.600
translation because that's pretty simple to be finished or completed I get that there's no complexity I feel good the

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:03.159
raft is not moving but look there's a wave coming up where was that second one and that verb Toto

00:24:03.159 --> 00:24:09.080
guess what it's got a whole another page of meanings on it it's got a whole another page of meanings on it look at

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:15.480
these people look at these people to bring to an end to finish right to come to an end to

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:21.440
fulfill right to pay what one owes okay wait a minute it's drifting a

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:27.240
little bit it's drifting a little bit let's see how the movement of the word goes through time this is the history of

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.480
this word people this is a history of a highly complex great concept give me the

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:38.840
next one watch this you're going to love this look at halfway look at oh look at

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:45.159
to initiate in the Mysteries wait a minute you mean this word leave it up

00:24:45.159 --> 00:24:52.080
this word is part of is used for initiating into the Mysteries

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:59.799
yes yes it is does it fit the context of Genesis why yes it fits it

00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:05.600
perfectly fantastic the Greek mind behind the Bible and you have to realize

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:12.760
what I am telling you tonight let it be announced let it be announced and by the way speaking of announcements I'll be on

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:18.840
a radio program on the East Coast um in New York

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:26.679
WABC um the Frank Morano show this Sunday so um on that

00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:33.360
program I would love to be able to show people

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:41.039
to to just very very vividly demonstrate to people how their Bible their God

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:46.480
their religion is based upon something entirely different than what they think

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:52.640
it is did you see that word to initiate it's also used in magic you

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:59.840
know what you can do when you make something tellos in Magic and when I say magic magic I mean the stuff Moses and

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:07.480
Jesus were both heavily using magic what can you do what can you

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:14.880
do with this magic you can endow things you can make them complete did you know

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:21.520
you could endow something with a spirit with a Dione did you know you can

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:29.360
energize something it's all Quantum you can do it fantastic you know

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.520
what a good time to do all that stuff is when you're at the

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:40.720
crossroads yeah you look in the three ways let's get to the hexad I love this

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:47.000
okay people hold on buckle up get back in the bus we we're leaving the 10th Century um I don't know maybe we should

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.720
beat it up a little bit more the 10th Century go ahead hit that one too oh look it's just more me people it's just

00:26:53.720 --> 00:27:00.039
a ton of more meaning that I just cannot keep pouring this into your brain right

00:27:00.039 --> 00:27:05.919
keep going next one um that the toan to finish something right now what about

00:27:05.919 --> 00:27:11.279
this Cosmos there was a cosmos in this verse that the that the King James

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:19.679
missed because the King James relied on that 10th Century um Hebrew um Matic

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:25.240
text right which we're going to show in just a second is a translation of the

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:31.559
Greek it's so cute the way this work out it's like dude this is irrefutable this

00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:38.880
is irrefutable put me into a room with um some of the leading uh linguists some

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:45.519
of the leading philologists and Semitic studies people and let me show them this

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:52.039
please please let me show them this okay tonight you get to preview it right this

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:58.159
is before we go to trial right you and I are just by the way um shout out to

00:27:58.159 --> 00:28:05.000
everybody in the gallery tonight who's been Faithfully watching and who's had lots of great

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.600
input and anything you want to say um say it you know what I mean um love it

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.840
hail Satan guys give me some hail satans in that thing right okay here we go

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:24.679
let's get back to it okay call us up the next text please

00:28:24.679 --> 00:28:32.240
we're looking at Cosmos we didn't see it how do they translate Cosmos um into

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:38.640
SAA right Saba which is like an army war or Warfare okay I see how those are

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:44.559
combined together Saba sounds pretty straightforward doesn't it is that what

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:52.600
a cosmos is my go that is not even the furthest thing from a cosmos but I'll

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:58.640
show you why they use this word okay just keep this word in mind as an army

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:05.080
for Cosmos what does the Greeks say what does the Greeks

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:12.200
say NOP uh there we go um blow that up you

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:18.519
you're good you're good back back blow it up thank you chewy order order what

00:29:18.519 --> 00:29:27.760
is cosmos order order how about number two good order good behavior form or fashion oh interesting

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:33.120
form or fashion I kind of see look who's under form and fashion oh God I want to

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:40.600
I just want to nuzzle up close to this to this gorgeous gorgeous entry look at

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:47.120
number three form or fashion they give you parities right oh God you're gonna see

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:54.480
how this word transforms over time give you the next page because there's more Cosmos out there what else is Cosmos

00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:00.399
what else is Cosmos look at this one look at this one honor or

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:06.799
credit yeah yeah ruler ruler a

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:13.960
regulator ruler a regulator why well it's all about order it's all about

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:20.000
order and look at number four World Order everybody today is talking about

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.519
World Order what's a world order it's gonna be one world

00:30:25.519 --> 00:30:31.360
order they don't realize they're talking about Cosmos but they do and this

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:36.760
doesn't exist if there's another one give me the other one I want to see that one too um and this doesn't

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:44.919
exist yeah yep no that oh yeah leave it up for a second and this doesn't exist in the

00:30:44.919 --> 00:30:52.120
world of the Hebrew right this this one concept Cosmos has a history that's a

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:59.679
thousand years older than this uh Hebrew text that is

00:30:59.679 --> 00:31:06.919
supposedly translated in the 3 Century right but which we know is is

00:31:06.919 --> 00:31:13.240
originally a Greek text which was then later back translated it's why the guys like take it down and then put it back

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:18.639
in second it's why the guys with the fragments um they're always finding

00:31:18.639 --> 00:31:25.440
Greek with them right it wasn't Hebrew that they were translating to Greek right they didn't need to do that the

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:31.240
Greek was already there it was Greek that they had tried to translate into

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:38.039
Hebrew and when they did they made all sorts of mistakes what kind of mistakes

00:31:38.039 --> 00:31:44.639
you say are the evidence that we can trace those mistakes are the technical

00:31:44.639 --> 00:31:51.000
mistakes it's like a fingerprint they left their own fingerprint on the text

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.240
as they back translated them this is fantastic you're gon to love this keep

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:02.960
go to the next one so um look at this Cosmos here it's a microcosm okay

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:08.960
inhabited world look at the number five it's the Pythagorean name

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:16.080
for the hexad cosmos is the Pythagorean name for

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:22.039
the hexad and what you say you ask is

00:32:22.039 --> 00:32:27.880
that um how could we possibly bring that to you let me

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:36.200
just suck up real close here mentally let me just suck right up to Pythagoras

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:43.960
through some of his students and just kind of pull that hexad back in pull

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:50.120
that hex ad back in it's an invisible letter did you know the hex ad is an

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:55.760
invisible letter oh isn't that neat you already

00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:01.639
know you already have have a knowledge of the names right now listen to this

00:33:01.639 --> 00:33:08.440
listen to this they are also um they also called it the hexad the hurler of

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:16.559
missiles presider over the crossroads and measurer of time in

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:23.880
twos hurler of missiles from it being generated by the Triad which of course

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:31.480
the hexad is generated by the Triad of us take math I hope so not this kind

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:37.960
though see we didn't have the good stuff we had that basic ID right this is a little bit more

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:43.799
complex This Is The Stuff the the people who are figuring out A2 plus b^2 equals

00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:50.279
c squ those nerds this is their stuff and by the way a shout out to Robin

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:56.399
Waterfield right um for this translation because this is highly technical Greek

00:33:56.399 --> 00:34:01.559
um Robin had to know a ton of mathematics to be able to write this to

00:34:01.559 --> 00:34:07.760
be able to translate this n nice job doc Waterfield that's uh yeah a light in the

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:13.200
midst of a generation that is dark um fantastic presiding over the crossroads

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:18.280
perhaps from the nature of the Goddess that is

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:24.960
hecy with that moon coming in between the

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:31.118
sun you know and its capacity of shedding

00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:39.878
light right whenever the eclipse takes place the moon and the sun are in combat

00:34:39.879 --> 00:34:46.919
with each other and we on the Earth are the ones who suffer the

00:34:46.919 --> 00:34:54.839
switch we suffer the switch don't be surprised if the Dolphins if the Dolphins come up and

00:34:54.839 --> 00:34:59.960
live in the forest and all of those predators that live in the mountains

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:07.480
don't be surprised if they go live in the waters nothing could be less natural

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:15.079
than this switch but it's a reality of quantum physics apparently um according to the

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:21.480
Magi at least so the event remember the event tomorrow and events like it

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:28.560
they're more like waypoints they're for a voice for a

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:34.599
sentient voice that sings existence they are like

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:40.720
waypoints we don't get lost because of them and the oracles find these

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:47.400
waypoints and they then use them right and so it's guiding us it's guiding us

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:54.599
let me just finish this with the hexad um Pro uh and each moment movement is

00:35:54.599 --> 00:36:00.800
twofold being bounded on on both sides by boundaries right the hexad is the

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.000
first to acquire the three movements of the

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.640
dimensions these nerds I tell you soon as they start this I'm like whatever um

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:18.359
yeah what is it mostly since what is the hex said give

00:36:18.359 --> 00:36:25.400
me the heart of what it is Pythagoras just spill it to me you know your math is blowing my mind it's just you know

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:31.160
whatever um since there are seven Celestial

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:40.839
movements okay those are the vowels I know that if we're talking about the singing Oracle okay I'm with you so far

00:36:40.839 --> 00:36:48.680
since there are seven Celestial movements apart from the movement of the fixed Stars which is eighth but

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:54.720
complex and since by their hurdling they produce the same number of notes than

00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:03.800
their intervals on and as it were means are necessarily six you mean the cosmos

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:11.280
the organization of everything that is is under the control of the

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:16.760
hexad yeah yeah

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:21.800
interesting interesting that's quite a crazy

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:28.200
arithmetic conclusion that you people have come to who are sitting there

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:35.280
telling us about the future and operating this Bronze Age religion that

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:41.720
ultimately would produce Judaism and Christianity and Islam from it my

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:46.760
brothers and sisters in Christ or in Moses or in

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:52.000
Allah I have news for you your gods are

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.280
all the gods of the pagans of the Bronze Age

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:04.800
age your ancestors worshiped bakus and Aphrodite

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:12.480
let me say that one more time let me say that one more time my brothers and

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:19.880
sisters who are Jews Muslims and Christians our

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:25.520
ancestors worshiped dionis and

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:30.760
Aphrodite long long long before your

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:38.240
Gods ever showed up oh fantastic fantastic Can You Feel It In

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:44.880
near air it's the only Power that permeates every every sort of belief can

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:50.520
be penetrated by this it's the power of love baby it's power of

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:57.839
Aeros yeah it's the stuff that they don't want you to know the text is bringing you but it's bringing you and

00:38:57.839 --> 00:39:03.480
here we go are you ready let's go back to the let's go back to our text we got to keep walking I don't want to keep

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:09.680
people long this is the night before you know so yeah give me um let's go to

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:18.240
uranos yeah what else is in the picture here that we have to translate uranos right this is the sky the sky translated

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:25.280
very simply is the sky what is uranos show me show me look at uranos right the

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:32.079
Vault the vault right okay look again people look at the look at the thickness of the Greek and

00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:39.280
look at all of these sources right in communion Lang in common language excuse me it's the

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:49.040
sky okay Pythagorean name of 10 10 the decad O now I understand do

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:56.040
you know what the decad is well how are you going to figure out what the hexad is if you don't know what the dead is

00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:02.079
the de nead comes after the NAD and the NAD is the number of un is the

00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:07.720
arithmetic number of universal completion and

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:15.359
Perfection oh my are you kidding me is there this much meaning in these words yes are you

00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:21.079
surprised at all that the Hebrew has just a just a just a little Dy and again

00:40:21.079 --> 00:40:27.079
this is classical Hebrew modern Hebrew is thriving and has has taken its it

00:40:27.079 --> 00:40:33.520
roots of vocab through the roof right and they'll continue to do so because that's what living languages do

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:41.720
unfortunately Hebrew died Hebrew died and the only thing we had were the Greek

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:46.960
sources you know what we should do we should write a letter that says hey this

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:54.200
thing was trans was originally a Hebrew text that was translated nobody believes that you did they didn't pull that over

00:40:54.200 --> 00:41:02.800
on the Greeks or the Romans they knew that that was BS right propaganda is important

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:08.359
propaganda is important please people let me just take you to megido I know

00:41:08.359 --> 00:41:16.480
I'm taking too long tonight but let me take you to megiddo and in this place where

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:22.560
Armageddon is doomed to happen in this place as you

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:29.440
dig down underneath all of the G garbage toll

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:34.599
stations that have sprung up in this godforsaken

00:41:34.599 --> 00:41:40.599
place right because it's on a major trade rout figures that's where the end

00:41:40.599 --> 00:41:48.000
would be where all you humans with your greed as the Watchers say your greed

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.839
they talk about it like it's our terminal disease or something any who um

00:41:53.839 --> 00:41:59.079
megido when you dig down underneath all that stuff you know what we found and yeah I'll say we found because I was

00:41:59.079 --> 00:42:06.480
there digging we found a Canaanite Temple we found that Temple when you are

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:12.200
standing in the eclipse when you are in that moment when

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:18.040
via the moon's power right via the moon's power you're

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:23.800
able to access those three roads and you say wait a minute isn't this a solar

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:31.640
event of course it is yes um do you know that the sun and the

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:38.559
moon and the stars that they are all connected yeah you might say with

00:42:38.559 --> 00:42:44.359
gravitational forces or something along those lines but there is a Quantum link

00:42:44.359 --> 00:42:51.040
there do you know how they're able to date events of the future

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:57.200
from 3,000 years ago with the Stars

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:03.599
right so here's what we're doing in the midst of that

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:12.359
eclipse in the midst of that time that is when we have the date set

00:43:12.359 --> 00:43:22.280
for a switch and that switch kicks in and it kicks these new powers in with it

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:29.800
let's go to the next text who is uranos look at this people uranos he's the son

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:37.160
of arabus and Gaia wait a minute but then what's it say on the next part line but husband of

00:43:39.079 --> 00:43:44.599
Gaia where's that where is that guy Paul where's that guy Paul Paul you think

00:43:44.599 --> 00:43:51.440
you're so smart you think you're so s people Paul the Apostle Paul the Apostle

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:57.480
um Paul you thought you were quite a quite a smart guy right Paul with your letter to the col Colossians you thought

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:07.839
you were cuz you buried in there Paul you buried in there some meat didn't you didn't you Paul please please give us an

00:44:07.839 --> 00:44:14.359
explanation of this Jesus Christ Paul please but give it to us Paul in a way

00:44:14.359 --> 00:44:20.440
that only the Frans would understand Paul because these are the

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:25.839
Colossians yeah I want some frian Roots here Paul are you ready for this go to

00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:32.720
the get that one yeah here is what here is what uranos comes

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:38.640
from oros when you take the number six when

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:44.040
you take the hexad and you bring the hexad

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:52.240
back what do you get what do you get you get that limit you get that limit you

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:57.960
find that Cosmic limit give me the

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:08.000
next he is that thing which is the boundary he's the boundary uranos is the

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.520
boundary what set the boundary leave it up for a second should we what set the

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:20.000
boundary Gaia did Gia did when she entered into

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.640
Union with uranos remember this is the magic book

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:33.440
say as the author of Genesis this is the magic book of the

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:41.480
generation of uranos and GA that's why we're all here right it's what we're all

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:50.680
here to see and what is this what about Gaia where did she come from Gaia has no

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:57.400
father she has no mother she does not come from from a nymph she does not come

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:05.760
from no Gia comes from water and all of a sudden those of you

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:12.359
who are sitting on your Islands worshiping Aphrodite perk up say

00:46:12.359 --> 00:46:19.200
yep yep I get it I understand the transformation I understand the

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:27.799
castration and why it's a necessary event why must you hobble

00:46:32.599 --> 00:46:42.079
I'm back oh that was painful let's not do that again why must you hobble the

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:47.640
sun imagine that imagine that the

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:54.720
great the great three ways of traffic in the

00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:01.280
cosmos do you hear how I just Ed Cosmos I used it like they used it not like we

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.520
use it so what you can see is the Hebrew wasn't able to capture Cosmos it used

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:12.079
the word for Army it used the word for Army now let's catch them do you know

00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:17.280
why they use the word for Army if you scan that definition of Cosmos you'll

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:23.680
find that it can be used to station

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:28.839
troops so the people who translated from

00:47:28.839 --> 00:47:35.319
the Greek assumed oh well this is the way that they're using it and then they

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:40.720
translated it that way they they reached for the one thing in Hebrew that they

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:46.040
could find to kind of bridge that Gap and they did but it's just the word for

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:54.839
Army and it has nothing to do with the book of The Magic generation of uranos

00:47:54.839 --> 00:48:00.000
andaya yeah not only that but that word not

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:08.599
only that but that word for to finish the teet root that word Teo it's a

00:48:08.599 --> 00:48:13.839
compound it's soon Teo in other words it

00:48:13.839 --> 00:48:22.200
is now a degree more advanced technically it is that much more highly

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:30.119
specific so the Hebrew greet for the very base and wasn't able to capture the

00:48:30.119 --> 00:48:36.680
prefix why they don't have the vocabulary people they just didn't have the vocabulary it's just the development of the language how much time they had

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:44.000
and what the influences were the Greeks are sitting around these islands baby have you been to the Palaces from the

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:51.280
Myans man they had a good and they developed a very

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:56.880
sophisticated language for writing and for composing and for bringing things to

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:04.079
life like drama they were the ones doing this and they did it through bacas they did it

00:49:04.079 --> 00:49:12.240
through bakas do you know people I want to show you on the night before the eclipse on this Friday the

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:18.200
13th thank you Universe thank you for

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:25.799
this organization for this Cosmos that we can bring this Bak

00:49:25.799 --> 00:49:31.280
reality to life if you are Jewish

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:37.079
religiously right because most of the people that I worked with in Israel were like

00:49:37.079 --> 00:49:43.920
no right they're concerned about democracy you know that's what they were concerned about surviving and a lot of

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:50.559
them didn't want didn't want to be doing what they were doing or thought their career could go this way or that way you

00:49:50.559 --> 00:49:58.599
know they didn't care about the religion but for the people who do I want to reach out to you and say your religions

00:49:58.599 --> 00:50:06.559
are all bakic they're all based in bakic worship and this is a

00:50:06.559 --> 00:50:13.640
drunken um enthusiastic maniacal mystery that initiates you into

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:19.920
death into rebirth that brings you why does it do all that for the same reason that Moses

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:26.960
built that Temple that Tabernacle excuse me that tent in the

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:32.119
wilderness so that God could speak to him

00:50:32.119 --> 00:50:39.880
directly isn't that nice he made a a locality a testerian

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:46.440
so that this God that we've just been reading about could communicate this is

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:54.440
the one that messed up the garden right he could communicate through the

00:50:54.440 --> 00:51:00.599
magic with the power of the cosmos

00:51:00.599 --> 00:51:08.720
this is the magic book of the generation of uranos and GA let's go on

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:16.200
Chey let's go on we need to finish on somber note um yeah just uh how about

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:25.079
that one yeah I want to bring up because Paul was here I was expecting this Paul um

00:51:25.079 --> 00:51:30.160
yep assum in position he got he knows Paul knows he goes right away assum in

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:35.040
position buddy you know how it is give me this

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:49.000
H yeah what did you tell me that Paul what' you tell me there who is the

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.400
acon who is the acon the image the reflection that is a reflection pie

00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:01.720
people it's not an image like you would see carved this is a reflection did you know

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:09.520
the Greeks differentiated between the image that is the image and the image that is the reflection we call them both

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:15.240
images yeah yeah but this acor is the

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:23.160
reflection this is who who's Jesus tell me for you and I I I have such a burden

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:28.480
for those of you who are Evangelical and who were under who are under that

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:35.319
slavery of greed that is Christianity it is a slavery a Perpetual

00:52:35.319 --> 00:52:41.319
slavery to greed because and you you guys know if you didn't have you know

00:52:41.319 --> 00:52:48.880
we're talking about Jesus Christ who was arrested in a public park with a naked boy if he didn't promise you ionic life

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:56.680
because he didn't promise you eternal life he promised you ionic life look at look it up if he hadn't promised you

00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:02.640
that would you have followed him you got to ask yourself that it's the same question the devil did you hear the

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:09.520
devil I heard the de Chey the devil came it's the same question the devil

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:18.440
asked job only honors you because you give him things so this

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:23.880
genius who destroyed the garden situation cuz he couldn't see that

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:29.599
Lucifer the hottest creature ever I might add would screw

00:53:29.599 --> 00:53:37.480
things up with Eve in the garden he didn't see that coming so he messed up the whole thing he messed up the whole

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:43.839
thing that guy comes along and he's giving us this system bring back up Paul

00:53:43.839 --> 00:53:54.160
he's giving us this system to work with Jesus is the image of

00:53:54.160 --> 00:54:01.680
God who of the who the the one who is unseen wait a minute you mean

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:09.720
fannies okay all of you have had little bit of the Greek and you've been looking at the sources this is the Unseen one

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:16.160
this is coming from the waters coming from the waters do you feel Genesis now

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:21.480
you should you should be start to begin to understand the Genesis we sent this

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:27.240
stuff here eons ago right it should be taking

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:35.720
effect right about now watch this he's the protos that

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:42.839
first born of all of that which is

00:54:42.839 --> 00:54:47.920
produced everything that is the material

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:53.400
reality he is that first born now for those of you who are

00:54:53.400 --> 00:55:01.480
orics you hear that it makes perfect sense because this is who the orphics worship from the beginning this

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:06.880
invisible God this unseen God and Jesus

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:13.280
is that firstborn from that

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:20.799
entity the cosmos you're looking at the mystery of the cosmos in the face why is

00:55:20.799 --> 00:55:26.319
uros both the son and husband of Gaia

00:55:26.319 --> 00:55:32.280
ready Paul Paul can you give us this one Paul come on come on Paul wake

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:40.039
up because in friia when you're dealing with the worshippers of cile you're dealing with

00:55:40.039 --> 00:55:48.920
the son who is also a lover yes when Jesus was arrested in the

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:55.520
public park with a naked boy there's a reason for it a very strong long

00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:02.640
historical reason for it so I would end with saying for those of you who are

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:08.240
praying for me whether it be for my destruction which I've gotten some of

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:17.280
those those are always entertaining um or whether it be for um my blessing my

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:22.359
blessing I would ask you all just to do one

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:29.720
thing tell me what's he doing with the naked kid I don't like fairy tales and

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:38.079
I'm tired of the lies I want the garden back and I want the gods who won't mess things up I want

00:56:38.079 --> 00:56:44.000
Lady Babylon the Dolphins must come to the

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.039
mountains and the beasts who hunt in the forest they have to return to the water

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:55.599
in order for us to switch the poles

00:56:55.599 --> 00:57:03.920

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:08.960
world this reality hail

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:19.599
Satan that F us all in fences created by such evil men then

00:57:19.599 --> 00:57:29.680
we could tear down the fences that fence us all in maybe we could walk together

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:34.920
again just maybe we could walk

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:41.079
