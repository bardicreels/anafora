00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:50.840
person in the thir Century probably Jewish who wrote the Torah in Greek for

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:57.360
the first time when he did that the bonee head encoded he used he he used

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:04.639
the orphic mystery and I'm going to show you tonight I'm going to break the code Plutarch knew this straight up and um

God are they in on it too are they in on it holy Mel let's look at it when this

00:33:24.399 --> 00:33:30.720
thing was written when your Torah when your Bible was written your Old Testament was written in the 3r century

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:37.240
BC the Knuckleheads that composed it borrowed from the cult that was present

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:45.279
in their society it's not it's not a surprise it's not a surprise but they weren't smart enough to hide it they

palasan because it's it's old this technology is old let's go to the next

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.920
one for all the pests that out of Earth arise the Earth's Own Self the antidote

00:35:54.920 --> 00:36:02.520
supplies she breeds the Viper but she too the sage the means presents to qual

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:08.800

from her bosom wide yeah and hapless Mortals with sure

00:36:14.599 --> 00:36:20.079
help provide let's go to another one do you see how much where is the thinking

00:36:20.079 --> 00:36:26.440
here the scientists are thinking we get dotes and antidotes we give drugs they

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:33.240
cause reaction we give antidotes to block the activities or the symptoms that those drugs produce we make a

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:38.640
cocktail so that we can specially design the person imagine if it's the future

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:46.440
and you can walk up to a panel and you can push a button and you can say I need a combo that lift me up pull me down put

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:52.760
me this way make me feel this give me a little couple inches of height and maybe

00:36:52.760 --> 00:37:00.480
make me aroused boom out of comes that's only because of people who

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:07.400
have done thousands of years of work on what those substances do that's a lot of

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:12.640
laboratory time people that's a lot of laboratory time and who is the one

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:18.079
culture that we keep seeing who that that are really pioneering this doe and

00:37:18.079 --> 00:37:23.920
antidote who what's the one culture it's those children of the sun Daughters of

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:29.040
the sun they're the ones who were doing all all of this experimental stuff all

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:34.520
of this experimental stuff did you see in this cult text that I've been reading

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:44.440
you from from the translation that's what the English is that I keep putting up it's all cult text did you notice the

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:50.760
names that we've mentioned so far Cersei and media of course of course let's go

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:58.760
back to the next Source this is going to get really good now hold on okay um yeah and he showed to me a river and a river

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:05.319
of Water of Life and it was shining as Crystal I just want to keep going and it was coming out of the Throne of God and

00:38:05.319 --> 00:38:10.920
the and the sheep skin and in the middle of this road you know there was this

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:16.280

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:26.839
oh okay and uh yeah I this is the river I don't know why I wanted you to see it again I wanted you to see it again for

00:48:26.839 --> 00:48:33.520
some reason but let's I've got four or five more let's let's let's keep up a pace here look at verse 15 now you're

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:38.559
saying where is this from guess what kitties remember that Jewish guy that

00:48:38.559 --> 00:48:46.440
wrote the Torah in the 3 Century BC remember him um this is what he's

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:51.359
writing and this is from

00:48:53.680 --> 00:49:02.240
Exodus it sounds so fun funny right exodos guess what language gave us that

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:08.920
right okay um and what did he say what what is God's command to Aon and the

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:15.440
boys the Levites what's the command what's the

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:21.440
command and you got to make an oracle you got to make an oracle loon is

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:29.760
an oracle you got to make an oracle of cron w yeah what go to the next go to the next

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:35.920
you got to make a what you got to make an oracle look people look at number two they knew this in Antiquity I'm not I

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:42.799
mean they knew this in in the last 200 years I'm not bringing up anything new this is the thing that they're making

00:49:42.799 --> 00:49:50.680
that the high priest is going to walk around in okay do you see it here it's coming here it's coming the reality

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:55.880
ready ready go to the next one it's a it's what kind of Oracle is it it's an

00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:03.599
oracle of look at number three and four it's an oracle of election it's an

00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:11.119
oracle of Dreams it's an oracle of Dreams importance didn't you know that the tent

00:50:11.119 --> 00:50:17.119
that Moses set up was called a testerian testerian now there is no word for that

00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:23.520
in Hebrew right so all of this has to be fudged when it's time for people to

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:29.160
appropriate and they start taking the Greek and translating it into what is by

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:38.759
then lurgical Hebrew so they only have they only have like 8,000

00:50:39.559 --> 00:50:45.040
words I'm sorry but it is such a bad

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:52.000
idea it is such a bad idea the fact that those knuckle heads couldn't figure out

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.799
that they couldn't possibly translate all the technical terminology is

00:50:57.799 --> 00:51:04.559
hilarious I had a couple of verses for you I was going to bring and show you just it was verse 12

00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:09.960
2812 and I was going to show you um look the Greek uses two words with the same

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:16.640
root right next to each other for a reason here like it loves to do and the Hebrew doesn't know what to

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:21.799
do the Hebrew doesn't know what to do so it uses two different totally different

00:51:21.799 --> 00:51:27.480
terms that are only related to the art that the Greek is talking about the art

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:33.119
that the Greek was talking about is embroidery right so um it's you know

00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:38.160
it's there it's there I hope I hope oh it's there's so much to be done there's

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:45.319
so much to be done with that let's keep going I'm almost there Gnostic I'm almost there but wait we got a good thing coming up okay blow this up toy

00:51:45.319 --> 00:51:52.079
now people here is the sacred document here's the sacred document and I just wantan to I I've shown you a couple of

00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:57.799
lines of this in the past this is the orphic litha right and he says look

00:51:57.799 --> 00:52:06.359
Hermes the son of Maya he he came here and he gave us a gift he gave us the gift of the danger averting Zeus or the

00:52:06.359 --> 00:52:13.280
danger averting God right and what is this thing it's an it's a remedy it's a

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:18.880
remedy for all of your pain it's a remedy for your pain yeah and um The

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:25.400
Mortals that take it right these people are going to they're going to do good things right and they have to be in a

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:31.680
certain State they have to have a heart that's pure right you got to have Pure Heart these satanists don't want you

Asiatic Greek that's a just slight just a slight hint

00:57:09.839 --> 00:57:15.240

initiation and bible studies um tell me something tell me just really quick

01:05:03.319 --> 01:05:09.520
before I get into the interview part and PE people love to see it people last time were saying in the comments they're

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:15.520
saying who he's so hot well I got I want to add some

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:21.279
sources in compliment to what you've already brought brought across because I think the main the main theme here and

01:05:21.279 --> 01:05:26.440
main theme of the S Sanic initiation in general is there is no escaping the

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:33.440
world the Greek world that these religions are operating in theology

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:39.119
itself comes from the orix Orpheus being called the first Theologian all of this

01:05:39.119 --> 01:05:44.200
descends from media and the Magical rights that came out of culus that

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:50.920
influenced the atrans the Greeks the Romans the carthaginians the Egyptians everybody and they call themselves

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:58.359
orphics they pythagoreans pythagoreans are basically orics that are living in Italy uh Plato was one of these people

01:05:58.359 --> 01:06:03.680
he called himself an oric he he he starts platonism uh the stoics come

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:09.760
along and the stoics and the platonist mix together you get middle platonism that's where Christianity comes out of

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:15.839
and so forth and there's no escaping this you you can only you there's certain that when they're speaking in

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:23.119
their languages whether it's Hebrew or Greek or Egyptian there are certain words that etymology goes back to these

01:06:23.119 --> 01:06:29.880
orics and like I'm going to show you like the word Eucharist you and carus to

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:36.279
give Grace that's a technical cultic term but I'm getting ahead of myself

01:06:36.279 --> 01:06:42.279
first I want to show Paul our buddy Paul our Pure Paul you know he has obviously

01:06:42.279 --> 01:06:49.440
no links to Media right that'd be crazy media is a witch what would Paul have to do with media uh let's go with the

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:55.720
source that I got the first one I told you about when I'm the shared screen all right this is from from Titus one of the

01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:01.359
letters that are attributed to Paul um in the spirit of Paul maybe one of his

01:07:01.359 --> 01:07:06.520
maybe somebody who Paul is traveling with whatever it's Titus it's it's got

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:14.960
Paul's name on it and if you go down he says one of cit's prophets has said it

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:22.480
crans are always Liars evil brutes lazy Glutton this saying is true okay what

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:29.119
prophet is he talking about who's Prophet why is he calling him a prophet well it turns out this is from epimenides most people would already

01:07:29.119 --> 01:07:34.480
know that but here's the thing epimenides didn't make this up

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:40.079
epimenides is citing somebody and I'm going to go to this screen now

01:07:40.079 --> 01:07:46.839
epimenides is citing media here it is he reports athenodorus

01:07:46.839 --> 01:07:52.480
of eretria in the eighth book on his commentaries says that thetus and media

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:58.119
had a dispute in thess you know that's where the uh pans

01:07:58.119 --> 01:08:04.880
settled uh as to which was the most beautiful their judge

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:12.279
idenus who gave Victory to thetus media in Anger said the cretians are always

01:08:12.279 --> 01:08:18.838
liars and in Revenge she made the curse that he would never speak the truth just

01:08:18.839 --> 01:08:26.159
as he lied in his judgment there's that epen Paradox right there EP is citing

01:08:26.159 --> 01:08:34.920
media and then so by extension Titus Paul is is citing media there you go you

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:40.480
can't escape media's influence no matter how hard you try to purify or separate

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:47.238
those are pagans and we're Christians we're different we're going to put a a fake border around Israel or or Judea

01:08:47.239 --> 01:08:55.080
and say this is Judaism and everyone else is pagans no no no no you don't get to do that this is all the same cultural

01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:01.920
milu they're all in being influenced by these orphics these ancient uh magical

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:10.120
rights media is um she's a ma she's a Magus she she her and Cersei have the uh

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.719
the uh the famous R rombos which is what Jesus is depicted holding let me show

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:21.159
you guys here's Jesus holding his rombos you know this is the these are

01:09:21.159 --> 01:09:28.640
the oldest images of G Jesus in existence before the beard of Jesus that everyone knows he used to be depicted with like

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:34.159
this without a beard in fact sometime there's actually they found a statue of

01:09:34.159 --> 01:09:41.199
what they thought was Apollo exactly like Apollo you know that feminine look that Apollo carries then

01:09:41.199 --> 01:09:49.159
they found out later on it wasn't Apollo it was a statue of Jesus they just took a statue of Apollo and called it Jesus I

01:09:49.159 --> 01:09:56.159
mean I'm just trying to explain to you the imagery the culture cannot be escaped the influence cannot be escaped

01:09:56.159 --> 01:10:01.199
Jesus is a Magus like everyone else is now I want to go to

01:10:01.199 --> 01:10:06.600
Revelation this is revelation one where you have this idea

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:12.760
of this Jesus coming the hair on his head was white like wool his eyes were

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:19.480
blazing with fire his feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace and his voice was the sound of Rushing Waters

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:25.719
and in his hand he held Seven Stars what is this what kind of imagery

01:10:25.719 --> 01:10:33.440
is this well this is everywhere back in this time period you have the images of

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:39.920
the Invincible son always and I have I'm going to show some more this is one coin of Roman

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:45.560
mithus with the Seven Stars 1 2 3 4 five six seven there's your crescent moon and

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:51.440
there's your your gradiant crown and this religion of the unconquered

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:57.800
Sun comes from the East in particular the culus region where the

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.920
Magi are you know the Persians are mainly influenced by this too but ultimately if

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:10.360
you go back far enough you'll see this is from that little wedged region in between the Black Sea and caspan SE

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:15.920
region media is the daughter of the sun they were the F there was the kingdom of

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:21.000
the Sun the bosporus kingdom even in the time of Augustus they were this this

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.199
area of the world was so revered that no one was allowed to have a kingdom you

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:33.440
couldn't have a kingdom under Rome you have an emperor and everybody is either a you know either you're a Consul or a

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:40.360
governor some sort of tetrarch but the bosporus was allowed to keep their Kingdom the only place in the world that

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:46.120
was allowed to keep their Kingdom there was a lot of respect paid to this part of the world when odid got in trouble he

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:52.440
had to flee to that part of the world he had nowhere else to go he had to go to the bossus where he'd be protected

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:58.120
basically under basically as like a uh um you know sort

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:03.360
of like what you know Edward Snowden is right right now where you're you go like you're in trouble if he go if he goes

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:10.719
back to America he's gonna get arrested but he can hang out in Russia it's kind of like that it's kind of like opid right um so now I wanted to show that

01:12:10.719 --> 01:12:16.320
but I want I got some slides that I want to go through now and it's relating to these rights that I'm talking about I I

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.360
want to explain what I'm talking about so

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:28.850
let's oh I

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:35.080
[Music] think um yeah technical difficulties

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:41.760
people just second chewy what we flying to an asteroid oh back I'm back my bad oh here he is here he is okay good good

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:47.840
I'm do your thing no hold just give me a second because I got I gotta load it back up again now but

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:54.080
I let me say while while mostic is is reloading up here let let me just say

01:12:54.080 --> 01:13:02.480
how nice it is to hear the words of media out of the lips of Paul the Apostle that's so nice and what's even

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:09.239
maybe even more incredible is to hear it from epines because epines the prophet

01:13:09.239 --> 01:13:17.400
he's considered the one you know he inspired some stuff that ultimately ends up through Solon going into a world of

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:23.560
democracy so you know these these people especially the presocratic

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:30.800
man you cannot not give them enough credit I mean this guy is the Thomas Jefferson of antiquity Thomas Jefferson

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:36.440
and this guy I guarantee you epines and Thomas Jefferson are sitting in hell

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:43.120
right now with a table and a fine French wine and they are both having a

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:48.159
conversation that the demons are just sitting there like this oh my God these

01:13:48.159 --> 01:13:56.199
guys are fantastic right so hey um thank you for that epines link and also the

01:13:56.199 --> 01:14:03.440
fact that culus is you know is a region of the world where this art is evolving

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:10.880
that ultimately is the mystery that that Christianity and Judaism um spring from

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:17.320
yeah yeah and this is where you get the mes who name themselves after media you have Herodotus explains right in book

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:24.480
one of The histories that all this comes from media the the Trojan War itself is a result of some things that happened

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:31.440
according with media and and the um and Helen but I got some slides that I want

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:36.520
to bring on the screen now and now I click the right button so this is from this is from plutar we're gonna go

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:42.360
through some stuff that plutar has to say plut tark's talking about this zorer

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:48.320
mag Ma magian you know he says before the Trojan War uh he says 5,000 years I

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.719
don't know about all that may I don't know where he's getting that number from anyways but he says he calls the one

01:14:53.719 --> 01:15:00.639
Arman or it's Horas the ores and the later aranos right and there this

01:15:00.639 --> 01:15:09.080
there's something that's going on here that we see in Judaism where you have the the uh the yam kipor or you have the

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:14.960
where you have one goat that you set off into the Wilderness which is

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:20.840
aizel the evil you have these two different opposing Spirits right this is

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:26.480
something this is zor this com straight from zor who is part of in part of the same

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:33.560
region where media was located anyways he says furthermore the objects of sense

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:39.880
the one resembles light the other darkness mithas is between the two the

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:45.159
reason the Persians mythus the mediator remember Jesus says I'm the mediator and

01:15:45.159 --> 01:15:51.840
he says I am the L I am Lucifer the bright and Morning Star this is all cultic terminology that we see

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.880
everywhere right so mediator taught them to offer sacrifice and vows and

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:03.120
Thanksgiving that's in English if you go to the Greek you could check you guys can all check hopefully you guys are

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:09.600
checking me I don't want you to just take my word for if this was hit I'm on doing it he would just have the Greek up and I'm not as good as that so I just

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:16.199
kind of I go with the translation I check the Greek just because I want to know I want to know what's the terminology the word is not Thanksgiving

01:16:16.199 --> 01:16:21.400
the word is Eucharist he says that he's saying that

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:27.440
uh zoraster taught the of the Eucharist this is exactly what it says and it says

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:33.800
vows and Eucharist to the one of depre depr deprecation and mourning to the

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:42.400
other the rights of mourning ritual mourning of Adonis right ritual mourning of Jesus and for they bruise A Certain

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:48.880
herb am I think it's am Ammon or something Amon or something like that thing I that's how you pronounce it and

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:55.639
it's a in a mortar and they invoke Hades with it mixing it with the the blood of a wolf they sacrifice and then they

01:16:55.639 --> 01:17:01.000
carry it and throw it into a place where the Sun never comes and this plant they

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.639
call the de The Damons right okay now the reason why I wanted to show that is

01:17:06.639 --> 01:17:12.159
because I'm want to go go because Plutarch in another text that I have right here called the symposia where him

01:17:12.159 --> 01:17:18.239
and his buddies and one and is he's with his teacher his name is Ammon by the way ammonius that's his teacher and they're

01:17:18.239 --> 01:17:23.520
discussing what is this God of the Jews so go back to the slides if you can

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:30.320
and it says all right who is this God who is this God right and he says what's the mysteries of the Jews and is there a

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:35.719
solid reason that we can give to prove Adonis to be the same with bakus here's

01:17:35.719 --> 01:17:41.000
where we get into the syncretisms that we see with these middle platonist they're syncretizing they're they're

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.760
they're combining all these Gods into to Super Gods right so here we're seeing

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.840
the rights of Adonis and Bach is being M mingled together and he talks about how

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:56.920
I'm I'm skipping through through this you guys can read this screen uh pause it later or come back and pause it read

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:03.719
the whole thing I'm going to flip right through it he says the holy he says the uh this Most Holy somy of the Jews is

01:18:03.719 --> 01:18:09.360
exactly agreeable to the rights of bakus for which they call the feast that they celebrate in the midst of vintage

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:15.800
Furnishing their tables with all sorts of fruits and they sit under the Tabernacle whoops I'm getting ahead of myself and then it says that over on the

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:21.320
right he says uh for for they have the trumpets and the Grans use this at their

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:28.159
back Ofelia to call upon their God and he's noticing they're doing the same rights as people in alinan Mysteries

01:18:28.159 --> 01:18:35.120
he's I'm watching him do the exact same thing they're dressed the same they have the same Priestly garments he says that

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:40.480
the Levites have this name that looks a lot like uh a group of Priestly class

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:45.520
called the Lucius or evus he said either way whe whichever which one of the

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:50.679
emology is it's agreeable to bakas he's like he's looking at this and saying these are the rights and and the reason

01:18:50.679 --> 01:18:58.280
for this is if you tried to to separate Jerusalem as like this branched off

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:03.639
force field world where everyone else is separate from them and they have no influence on the outside and they're

01:19:03.639 --> 01:19:08.920
they don't know anything that's going on anywhere else you're going to lose this there's a there's a way that priest get

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:16.480
ordained in the ancient world and it was typical of how they offer incense on

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:22.239
certain days certain priests have to do the certain things they have a certain way to build their temples with the holy

01:19:22.239 --> 01:19:28.120
of holies in the middle we see this in Egypt we see this in Judea we see this in Syria all this is how this was done

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:34.280
this is a Bronze Age tradition from media from that time

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:41.120
period passed down everywhere throughout the entire Mediterranean world we call me and Amon call this the Bak Empire you

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:46.840
start to see this there's there's a com there's a common there's a there's

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:53.480
commonalities amongst these and they overlap each other it's no different for the priests of Israel

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:58.719
and so let's keep continuing on with this slide you can see it with the with the

01:19:58.719 --> 01:20:04.880
way they dress this is a Christian Orthodox priest holding the staff on the

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:11.360
right you're probably wondering what's that on the right is that just another staff that no no no that's a St that's a

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:16.920
Hermes staff found from 500 BCE from

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:23.520
Athens and that was welded onto a staff where the priest the uh yah o they're

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:31.400
called and they they they held they had their high priest holding these the this is this is a wand this is a this is a

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:37.199
Romos wand it's a magical it's a magical instrument and you see this Orthodox

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:42.239
priest is holding it why why do you think they're holding it do you really think this is just cool looking no this

01:20:42.239 --> 01:20:48.719
is there's reasons why they held on to these traditions this matters and you're thinking what about the Romans that's

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:56.800
Greek right well the Romans have their own way of doing it the Romans have their staff that they call elitus and the

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:02.560
augor in the ancient world held these and the augor did diviner with looking

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:09.880
at Birds right and it's funny because the word cardinal is is is a Latin word that

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:18.239
comes from these priests they named the red bird after the Cardinals and it's interesting because the augor used birds

01:21:18.239 --> 01:21:23.960
in their divination so you're like is there is something going on with that maybe I'm just throwing it out there I'm

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:29.280
just just looking at things I'm noticing now let's go to the next one there's

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:36.639
your Cardinal right there that red bird right it's augury stuff this is augury all right now mithas Lucifer the

01:21:36.639 --> 01:21:43.400
Invincible son the lightbearer you see the torch Bears the Dori there's actually a if you look at

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:49.199
the early Christ Association groups there was a branch there was a a a type

01:21:49.199 --> 01:21:55.560
of priest in the early Christian groups called the dead of fori same name as the

01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:01.120
groups of mithraic uh priests in fact a lot of these old mithraic temples were

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:06.960
repurposed for Christian churches there's churches right now in use not

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:12.360
not talk about old ruins people still attend churches today and the in in

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:17.880
their basements are myth raams they're still there they're not getting rid of them they just keep them there and the

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:24.920
people will travel to go see these places go look it up um this is what they did they have a story about St

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:30.239
Demetrius from the fifth century and he was the last one of the last Priests of

01:22:30.239 --> 01:22:36.840
the eloian Mysteries and the story goes I don't know how true this is but the story is that demoner visited him in

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:43.880
dream and told him to worship Jesus said she said take all of my rights and put them onto Jesus so we

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:50.920
have we have like fifth sixth Century texts about uh co-opting the eloian rights and

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:56.280
bringing into the fold in Christianity we see this with soul indictus as well

01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:02.800
so you start seeing early apologetics going on where they're trying to figure out when Jesus was born and the only

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:08.400
indication they have is they go off in in the Gospel of Luke where it says that

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:15.600
um when John was born his father Zachariah was one of the priests of a

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:22.040
sect called the uh abija which is the eighth division out of 24 divisions of

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:29.239
priests his job was to go in just like I just talked about these ancient rights the orphics would light certain incense

01:23:29.239 --> 01:23:37.159
for certain gods for certain festivals well they do this in they do this in Israel they have certain priests from

01:23:37.159 --> 01:23:42.520
certain classes in the case of Zechariah he was part of the the ABA abya or how

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:48.719
you pronounce it and they would twice two weeks out of the year it was their job to control the temple like its

01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:54.719
incense and so there's a little bit of indication on what time of the year he could have been there but anyways it

01:23:54.719 --> 01:24:00.760
ends up being where you can kind of hone it into like a month period you could

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:09.000
kind of pick there's some early accounts that say he might have been born on January 6 conceived in April six or

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.800
something like that and then there's later accounts when they start going you can start seeing the early apologetics

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:21.120
going huh Soul Is On The Rise soul is the head of the pantheon now elois came

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:26.840
along the sever came along and they're implementing these ancient Armenian

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:32.960
Persian Black Sea rights of mithus Solen victus and this is rising in the as I

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:39.000
showed you with the myth Rams everywhere and the Christians are looking at this and this is their main competitor of the

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:46.040
time period and they're going well wouldn't it be better if Jesus wasn't born on January 6th and we just made his

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:52.119
birth on December 25th oo that'll get some pagans to join us right which is

01:24:52.119 --> 01:24:58.760
what they they did so continue with the slides and so you start seeing the these

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:03.880
making know Jesus being born on December 25th uh and there's there on the left

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:10.199
you see svanis right that's look at them look at that image of sanas look how Christlike

01:25:10.199 --> 01:25:16.719
he looks you know what I mean you got your mithraic Kronos right he's holding the two keys you know the like Peter the

01:25:16.719 --> 01:25:22.159
keys of the church right there you have your Mithra born from The Rock between

01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:27.199
the dicar surrounded by the mithraic symbols there's your staffs with the

01:25:27.199 --> 01:25:34.560
serpents on them there's your stars there and then then you have the you the bread of the cup of the

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:40.320
Eucharist okay that's Universal you see that with eloian mystery you see that with soul and Victor mystery you see

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:45.679
that Christianity you see that everywhere on the bottom you can see there's another communion where they're

01:25:45.679 --> 01:25:51.480
all sitting at the table like the Last Supper doing their thing having you know these are these are ancient rights okay

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:57.639
and this isn't everyone's getting in this everyone's everybody has their own version of this because this is how it

01:25:57.639 --> 01:26:03.639
was in the Bronze Age this is how it's passed down from generation to generation and as synchron as these gods

01:26:03.639 --> 01:26:09.880
are being synced together through the Roman Imperial cult you start seeing this this is a text called

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:17.480
saturnalia by macrobius and he in this text he says that Apollo and the son are

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:22.880
the same and afterwards taught that he was the father of Liber

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:29.320
dionisis himself who is Apollo and there is no doubt from these that the son and

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:37.080
Liber dianis are considered the father of the same deity okay if you go down this is where

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:42.880
it gets crazy because you know you always hear this push back on the whole December 25th birth of the son of the

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:48.760
the Son of God thing well look what it says look what macrobes is saying here that in the winter

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:54.639
solstice he's depicted as a small child obviously know what that means he's born

01:26:54.639 --> 01:27:01.880
on the winter solstice such as the Egyptians bring forth that the edius on the certain day that a very short day

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:07.679
this is the winter solstice talking about as small in a child he's born on the winter solstice and then his age is

01:27:07.679 --> 01:27:12.840
set at the summer solstice when he attains his greatest height in the image

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:20.520
of the beard and then from from then on dimin dominations the God is represented as the fourth from an aging man likewise

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:26.840
in thce this is the same this uh likewise in thce the same is to be we

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:34.639
had to take the Sun and liberus who they call sabazius there he is there's sabazius

01:27:34.639 --> 01:27:41.639
black sea god right where the same area as media all right if we continue we'll

01:27:41.639 --> 01:27:49.159
see it says um and the sun is in the upper that is in the daytime hemisphere Apollo is

01:27:49.159 --> 01:27:54.440
invoked all right and in the Underworld world that is that night

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:59.800
dionis father of the book is held that's where I got in that red it says up there

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:05.080
Apollo and the sun are the same and uh Liber is also so dianite

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:12.480
he's basically what he's getting at here okay he's saying dionis Apollo sabazius

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:18.280
pan whatever you want to call him this is the Son of God he's born on the winter solstice that's when that's cuz

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:24.719
that's when the sun is at its smallest that's when the sky you can see the Sun only this is right now we're at the time

01:28:24.719 --> 01:28:33.320
where it's the shortest days of the year it's cold out it's the winter soltice time that's what this period is and so

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:38.880
um let's go to the next one it's the time of the year where the

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:45.719
the birth of the sun is is is happening the sun is being born and so here we go

01:28:45.719 --> 01:28:53.960
this is the crazy part this is what I wanted to get to he calls him yaho he so macrobius after explaining

01:28:53.960 --> 01:29:00.800
the rights of saturnalia and why we do saturnalia why we give gifts every year at this time why we shut down our

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.960
businesses why we held our New Year's festival at the C of

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:11.480
Janice and he says all these characters that we find in these mythologies are

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:17.920
all yaho he says it right here the sacred verses is called yaho for Apollo

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:24.199
CLA is consulted which one of these Gods should be considered who is called yaho now you know if you've watched my videos

01:29:24.199 --> 01:29:30.000
you see in the Chelan oracles they say bakus is y they'll say there's a Triad

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:37.199
and you see this with the early Christians especially the valentinians where they try they say the like you don't have trinitarian theology until

01:29:37.199 --> 01:29:43.560
like the fourth Century fifth century where they actually Institute the Trinity but the early gnostics were

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:49.159
already way ahead of them and they said that you know Jesus who is the Christ

01:29:49.159 --> 01:29:55.440
the logos is in a Triad with Zoe you were talking about Zoe earlier

01:29:55.440 --> 01:30:02.320
Zoe is called Sophia wisdom and they're in a Triad with the one the the the the

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:08.719
the one who is f Fones the the one that create self-created God right and that's

01:30:08.719 --> 01:30:16.159
what these early Christians were saying and this is and this is now you have a pagan saying yaho is this God so there's

01:30:16.159 --> 01:30:22.000
complete overlap and he he cites orus likewise orus uh I'll read the part

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:28.159
before that the power of this Oracle and the interpretation of the numbers and names by which the book the father and

01:30:28.159 --> 01:30:33.320
the son yaho are signified was executed

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:38.639
by K Le laus in a book called on the Oracle of Apollo clarus likewise Orpheus

01:30:38.639 --> 01:30:45.920
demonstrating that Liberty and the sun are one and the same God and he get he he cites the passage

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:51.360
and goes through how this is like these are ancient orphic ideas and so there is

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:56.840
no escaping or or orphic um inspiration

01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:03.040
in these ancient mystery writs Eucharist baptisms uh these are all initiations

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:12.040
for the ancient Mysteries so that's that brilliant brilliant oh my God I

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:18.000
need to go take a cold shower that was so good oh and by the way yah oh you might be wondering what that's not the

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:24.000
same as Yahweh what it is the oldest sagent copies that we have so whatever

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.199
septu agent copy you think is the oldest is not you're thinking of a church text

01:31:29.199 --> 01:31:36.960
called the Codex sinicus or the Codex alexandrus or the Codex um vaticanus

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:43.119
those are the three big church texts all of those are produced 325 or later so

01:31:43.119 --> 01:31:50.159
between 325 and 400 they start producing these big church texts where they take the sepagan Old Testament it's altered

01:31:50.159 --> 01:31:57.520
and the reason why we know it's heavily altered because we found fragments Greek fragments of the Old

01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:03.280
Testament from Alexandria and instead of and in a lot of places in that text

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:09.080
where it's supposed to say Yahweh it says yaho in the exact same spelling

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:14.280
that you just saw in the Saturn ellia so it's that same God that bakus is named

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:19.320
after in the Chalan oracles where they say another name for bakus is yaho so

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:26.320
plutar turns out to be correct what he's talking about he's not just throwing this up out of his ass Plutarch is

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:32.119
looking at texts that that call bakus yaho and the septu agent is using this

01:32:32.119 --> 01:32:37.320
God called yaho so he's not he's not just making this up he's citing texts

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:43.679
from the time period you see people you see what

01:32:43.679 --> 01:32:51.440
happens when you give a angry person a club of Truth you see what happens when

01:32:51.440 --> 01:33:00.080
they pick up that evidence listen to how many sources just listen to how many sources Gnostic just went through oh my

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:07.280
God I just heard one after another I was like oh irrefutable nobody can stand up to that

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:14.960
nobody you're swinging that lightsaber like it's red and you want to cut somebody in half yeah I'm say my weapon

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:22.400
is just sources that I just go to the sources yeah yeah it's a beautiful training people how lucky we are that

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:28.719
you know um Neil can jump in and can do all the source work so that there's no

01:33:28.719 --> 01:33:35.560
question listen to what he's talking about this revolutionary I don't know if people heard it but that's

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:41.560
revolutionary right that is a different view of History than any of us have had

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:47.480
yeah definitely and from the mouths of the people who were living it good God

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:55.840
you can't get any more authentic than the Bible scholars Neil you will take them and you will do things to them that

01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:04.880
are so naughty and so gratifying at the same time um oh God I love it and that's

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:10.600
why I want to say this too because that those those two religions that you see in the time of Constantine by the way

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:15.840
Julian the apostate is a nephew of Constantine he's from the same Dynasty

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:21.560
as Constantine originally these were two religions supposed to coexist and they

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:27.639
sort of mirror each other one of them is Christianity where it tries to separate itself from everyone else they're like

01:34:27.639 --> 01:34:33.840
the ancient hipsters we're different than everybody oh you like all that mainstream Apollo stuff we're different

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:39.679
we don't we have different we have Jesus but it's really they're just a bunch of hipster douches right you know that

01:34:39.679 --> 01:34:47.119
hipster douche that everyone knows that tries to listen to different music than everyone else and you've never heard this only I know this song that type of

01:34:47.119 --> 01:34:55.400
crap right that's what they were like but the the um the the rights of myth R and Solen vicus was another form of this

01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:01.159
ancient syncretist religion where you see both vtic and

01:35:01.159 --> 01:35:07.760
helenistic uh traits coming from that part that Armenia capid doia uh you know

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:14.320
the place where media was and a lot of this stuff Finds Its way into the Roman religion and this is what this was the

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:20.840
ancient Roman religion and let's not forget let's not forget that media is

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:26.520
called Metra so um the connection the

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:35.440
connections there un um unbelievably tight when Julius Caesar walks his

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:41.719
scrawny bottom up to the Temple of Venus genetrix which if you know Rome you got

01:35:41.719 --> 01:35:49.520
to understand this is like the cult that everybody who has Roman blood this is

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:57.159
their cult this is the Great mother the grics the producer of our people this is

01:35:57.159 --> 01:36:02.960
our mother you're talking about our mother he walks into her Temple and he

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:10.600
dedicates a portrait by some famous Greek dude um of media right

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:15.920
yeah yeah that's crazy but so Julius Caesar Augustus they're venerating media

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:21.760
you've see and and they and they're not bringing this out up for the first time in Rome because you go back to the at

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:27.719
truskin and there's media there media is all over the place and she's a big deal

01:36:27.719 --> 01:36:33.000
these ancient rights that these orphics are passing down are are if you want to

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.560
call it palasan I like that word because it covers it's it's not just Greece it's

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:45.600
also the Black Sea it's also Northern turkey that region Armenia it goes it's

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:51.360
all it's where you get this this uh it's where you see a lot of the the

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:56.639
derivatives of this ancient you see this with the the shites the Sha shites I

01:36:56.639 --> 01:37:02.920
think I pronounced it right with Shiva there like a Eastern dianis going on and this is the god that represented by the

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:09.280
Som drink in in the Persian religion they call it the haa and it's the god of

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:14.639
the of of the vine it's the god of the drugs that that possesses you and in the

01:37:14.639 --> 01:37:22.600
Greeks you see it's dionis so it's this it's the um it's the uh the K Kuan

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:28.400
Kon and so it's you see the same rights in their respective

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:34.639
languages you know tweaked in their own little way but ultimately it's these rights that are passed down from the

01:37:34.639 --> 01:37:40.719
Bronze Age being kept intact all the way up until the Middle Ages when

01:37:40.719 --> 01:37:47.599
Christianity and Sol and Vias are the the the last two but not just it's not really they're not the last two because

01:37:47.599 --> 01:37:53.719
you have the word Pagan comes from it means like rustic like people on the

01:37:53.719 --> 01:38:01.320
outside in the inner cities you have all these overeducated uh you know Ivory Tower

01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:06.920
sort of nerd orphic Pythagorean middle platonist stoic people that think

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:13.520
they're smarter than everyone else and they have religion figured out and they have they they look at they read PL and get their theology from Plato but

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:19.599
outside of that in the countryside you have these rustic worshippers of pan that don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about any of that

01:38:19.599 --> 01:38:24.679
stuff they just want they just following what their what they were brought down from their parents and their

01:38:24.679 --> 01:38:30.719
grandparents and they're keeping these rights alive they don't care what the new philosophy is of the day that that's

01:38:30.719 --> 01:38:37.040
those are the people that I love that's why they call them pagans they're think of the hillbillies that's what they call

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:43.320
them yeah yeah think of the farm girls imagine the farm girls that what do they

01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:48.400
do they're all tatted up and partially shaved and they go out on the weekends

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:53.760
at certain times of year and they they get get into groups don't get caught if

01:38:53.760 --> 01:39:00.159
you get caught they'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh excuse me oh I can't believe that's the first time I said that the um um they'll catch

01:39:00.159 --> 01:39:07.199
you and they'll kill you and this is their Pagan way this is their Pagan way

01:39:07.199 --> 01:39:12.560
imagine those imagine those types and I was I was talking to another academic

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:17.760
about this it was so hard to get rid of them because you what gonna do you're gonna slaughter them all you can't do

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:24.639
that that's I mean so they have to co-op them somehow they have to tell them stories deminer showed up in a dream and

01:39:24.639 --> 01:39:31.560
told and told Demetrius to worship Jesus you guys should do it it's totally cool oh we have a saint named Orpheus now and

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:37.639
he look he plays a liar just like orus does you see him trying to co-op them in different ways throughout different

01:39:37.639 --> 01:39:42.679
centuries they won't go away never do go away they're always our pagans they're

01:39:42.679 --> 01:39:47.760
always living on the countryside always all the way through the through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and the

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:54.678
enlightenment you always have the small minority of P pans living somewhere they

01:39:54.800 --> 01:40:00.920
survived you can see it you can see that Pagan influence come through when Rome's

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:08.639
like uh maybe we should start worshiping the frian mother why CZ in Oracle told your dumb

01:40:08.639 --> 01:40:14.159
asses to do it right and you see the fian mother influencing the virgin

01:40:14.159 --> 01:40:20.159
mother and those other capid oian frian Church fathers if you look at their tombstones we're just look me and you

01:40:20.159 --> 01:40:25.880
were just looking at one from not to one of the early church fathers I can't remember his name starts with an A and

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:31.480
his Tombstone doesn't even have the word Jesus or Christ on there once all it is

01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:37.040
is venerating the holy virgin mother like is that that's what they that was

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:43.920
synonymous with God the earliest Christians just the holy virgin mother gave me life gave me Zoey and this was

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:50.000
this is on the early church father's tomb then that Jesus isn't on there and Christ isn't on there and this is a big

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:55.400
Tombstone with with like 500 words no Jesus no Christ the holy virgin mother

01:40:55.400 --> 01:41:00.960
is all you get what is that I mean that says something about these early frian

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:06.159
capid oian church fathers yeah and you mentioned earlier you mentioned earlier

01:41:06.159 --> 01:41:11.920
that you know it's really these Black Sea peoples in the you know north of

01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:18.440
turkey modern day Turkey who were passing on this culture down into Asia

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:24.440
Minor um through the trading and through the business it's where all the Pirates

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:32.119
come from um the southern coast of the Black Sea is where um Alexander the

01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:42.360
false prophet you know famous he it's where he ends up going to start his uh start his

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:49.239
mystery yeah yeah and you got capid doia is wedged right in between the Persians and the Romans that's where you see this

01:41:49.239 --> 01:41:54.679
blending happening and and you see um sabazius that's that's the home of

01:41:54.679 --> 01:42:00.199
sabazius and and even Clement of Alexander is saying uh sabazius is a

01:42:00.199 --> 01:42:05.440
counter sign because sa the way sabazius was worshiped it's like Zeus and dianis

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:11.239
rolled into one it's like a godhead like Jesus and the father right and Clement's

01:42:11.239 --> 01:42:16.800
looking at this and Clement's saying this is a counter sign of the mysteries of Christ right he's saying They're

01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:23.840
copying Jesus that's what he's saying and Justin Martyr uses the same apologetic crap where he tries to say oh

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:29.400
mithas uh he says what does he say he says um you know how Hermes is called

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:36.199
the logos all that stuff that looks like Jesus it's not they're cop They're copying us well you want to know why

01:42:36.199 --> 01:42:42.719
they have to say that because they don't have a choice because they know it's it's either one way or the other so they have to argue for that side because they

01:42:42.719 --> 01:42:47.840
don't have a choice they know that these these Son of God rights are being

01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:54.679
applied to Jesus it's the other way around so that's that's where you start you see apologetics starts off early

01:42:54.679 --> 01:43:01.400
apologetics is not a modern thing that you just see today where you see people AP have being called apologist online or

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:08.199
on Twitter no no no no Christian apologetics started from day one you don't see Pagan apologetics you

01:43:08.199 --> 01:43:15.119
don't see or they don't care they're not trying to win you like you either initiate it or not you know what I mean

01:43:15.119 --> 01:43:21.480
you're either you're either a baket or you're not no one really is not really like that you know

01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:28.159
you were talking a little bit earlier you mentioned a couple of points that I wanted to bring up that were um super

01:43:28.159 --> 01:43:33.760
strong areas of like gold you T you just mentioned macrobius and let me give a

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:41.000
plug to M macrobius you know get out there and take a look at them you want to see some of that real some of that

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:46.199
real cult stuff you know what I mean that's where it is beautiful marvelous

01:43:46.199 --> 01:43:52.360
Source there's one I want to send people to one dracona nobody reads

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:59.320
dantus um playright right playright um not he's not technically a playwright

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:05.599
he's a dude who's exercising himself by writing um very short little

01:44:05.599 --> 01:44:13.480
playlets um yeah think more of a Garian than anything else um you know anywh who

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:18.639
you've got to see some of the titles that he uses the people of Rome

01:44:18.639 --> 01:44:26.320
understood for example they call Media scua right what is what is that from

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:32.199
it's from the fact that she's working in that region as the queen right again

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:38.760
it's the thing you mentioned there that was so important that people um I think need to hear is the bakic Empire you can

01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:46.840
watch this thing how are they promoting and pushing the power of the bakic Empire it's with the oracles with the

01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:52.599
oracles this system of oracles is consistent throughout Europe throughout

01:44:52.599 --> 01:44:59.760
the Mediterranean right all over North Africa the Cil yeah they combine that's

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:05.920
what happens in Alexandria they're taking all these texts from these different symbols and putting them all into one book that's kind of where you

01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:11.520
get the judeo-christian religion from comes from the cilene tradition and that's why you see all these prophets

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:17.400
like Jeremiah and Isaiah they're all it's all destruction the God's going to come and destroy you that's what you get

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:22.719
in the cilene oracles you know the guy who wrote the

01:45:22.719 --> 01:45:31.199
guy who wrote um the Torah and other parts um in the thir Century um that guy

01:45:31.199 --> 01:45:36.800
is borrowing so heavily from everything around I didn't mention it tonight

01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:45.040
Gnostic but I want to ask you this I want to ask you this they've got how many how many of those gems do they

01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:50.520
carry how many of those Sacred Stones does do they carry do you know what the

01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:59.440
litha has it has the powers it has the powers of the stones from the Bronze Age

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:05.040
before there was Moses before there was a Abraham before there was anybody

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:11.760
proposed at WISE right this is ancient history to the people yeah that's that Zod zodiacal Perfection that's what they

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:17.080
call it zodiacal Perfection the 12 see that all across the board all AC and

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:23.320
it's just obvious you how many fruits was it oracles it's not even this is not even a

01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:30.320
secret because the Sian oracles are still continuing to be written by Christians all the way into the 15th

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:36.480
century where they talk about the fall of Constantinople gonna happen so so

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:43.280
like they don't even hide that the tradition comes from the cilene text they called the first Christian cilis

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:50.040
right followers that's what kelus was saying he called when he starts listing off the groups of Christians the first

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:57.159
thing he says they're called civilist they're called simonian marianites and he lists to civilist first like you know

01:46:57.159 --> 01:47:03.719
how you you read the back of a ingredients and it starts with the biggest ingredients first and it's it'll

01:47:03.719 --> 01:47:09.760
say like oh uh sugar citric acid blah blah blah and it's always whatever whatever the most of it is is always

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:16.760
listed first that's how you kind of that's how you do stuff he said cilus first before he said anything else what

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:23.719
that says something about the tradition of Christianity where where it comes out of comes out of that alexandrian middle

01:47:23.719 --> 01:47:30.760
platonist world stoics and platonist clashing that's what it is the theology

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:38.000
it's Greek you can't this is what amazes me I I met somebody who's a theology PhD

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:43.800
who even he said I'm surprised I even have a theology degree they should just call my degree something else because we

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:49.000
don't learn any Theology and we don't learn any Greek he I don't know anything about presocratic I don't know anything

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:54.159
about Plato but I'm theology PhD that's like that's like calling

01:47:54.159 --> 01:48:01.239
yourself a surgeon and not knowing how to use a scalpel like like like what's going on like how do you do

01:48:01.239 --> 01:48:07.679
that funny it's hilarious NE I can't believe that you're in that millu that

01:48:07.679 --> 01:48:12.960
you're able to smell that thunk I love that isn't that amazing I'm gonna smell

01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:19.679
it on any on any guests that ever come in the future on your show I'm gonna I'm going to smell them before they come in

01:48:19.679 --> 01:48:27.679
did you I want people I want the satanic congregation to recognize um the use of source work here

01:48:27.679 --> 01:48:33.320
see there's no ideas Neil didn't dream this up he didn't sit around and say hm

01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:40.360
what kind of book can I write to make myself some fraking money and Status he didn't do that he's he's just going look

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:46.560
look at the sources and he can give you an accurate picture right that other

01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:52.520
people who are so-called Scholars can't keep keep up with right let's give give

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:58.159
Neil the Kudos that he deserves he you know I'm going to say this Neil you told

01:48:58.159 --> 01:49:06.639
me this in confidence but I don't think you'd mind me saying it um some other hooa somewhere else with a degree

01:49:06.639 --> 01:49:14.520
and a professorship um said wow how is how is Gnostic informance so well informed in

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:22.360
the sources right as if it belong belongs to them as

01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:28.239
if they can take these materials and make whatever they want and put stupid

01:49:28.239 --> 01:49:36.280
ideas in your head when somebody who's roning from the outside comes in it's a huge threat look look what your audience

01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:41.320
is way bigger than theirs well because it ain't 100 years ago 100 years ago if

01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:47.719
you were living in the time of France kumat or you know whatever Kyle young or somebody you had to be you had to go to

01:49:47.719 --> 01:49:55.440
university to get books you're not going on Amazon you're not reading them online and now everybody has the power you can

01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:01.000
go online you can get a Greek tutor on Wiz you can learn Greek and Hebrew you can learn everything you want from your

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:07.840
computer and you can read the texts they're all translated you have people have no you don't need to pay

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:13.040
$40,000 to be to learn this stuff maybe if you want to be an expertise in one

01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:19.000
specific area then go ahead knock yourself out go in debt for the rest of your life but if you just want like you

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.119
don't have to do you don't have to go in debt to learn this stuff I'm just saying I'm not I don't call myself an expert in

01:50:25.119 --> 01:50:30.159
anything but I will say I'm pretty confident in like basic understanding of

01:50:30.159 --> 01:50:35.239
a lot of this a lot of these subjects you know yeah I you can tell

01:50:35.239 --> 01:50:40.560
them Neil next time you talk to anybody um that you want to flash your badge you

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:48.040
tell them you officially have a master's degree from satanic you there you go and

01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:53.760
if you want them to play with you and the sources you welcome them in and then

01:50:53.760 --> 01:51:00.440
Neil Neil you never you never lighten up when you go in you smash the hell out of

01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:06.119
them do you understand you take that ground and you show them this is my Dojo

01:51:06.119 --> 01:51:12.280
you know what I mean you show them show them the way and you can do that with the sources everybody sees that tonight

01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:18.440
look there are a lot of BS artists out there there are a lot of people with degrees and with

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:24.840
titles that you and I don't have and those people will tell you this is the

01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:29.920
way it was and all you got to do is watch look what look what Neil did with

01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:36.440
the sword tonight he slayed he totally slayed he gave a picture of antiquity

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:44.480
that was razor sharp and Neil I could taste it I was getting all riled up kind

01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:52.280
of kind of aroused by the whole situation you know intellectually speaking and um to see Paul site media

01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:58.320
is pretty pretty hilarious because you can't escape you there is no escaping if you're writing in

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:05.079
Greek and even even just not even just the quote that's from media even just writing words in Greek you're you're

01:52:05.079 --> 01:52:11.960
gonna start you're gonna run into the technical cultic terms like Eucharist or Baptist stuff that you find in the

01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:17.040
azinian Mysteries and the mythra Mysteries Sam thracian Mysteries all

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:23.280
this stuff comes from this how many times does Paul talk about mystery the word mystery itself comes from the

01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:29.800
ancient mystery rights it didn't mean it didn't mean like solve a riddle of a of a novel it

01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:37.320
meant mystery the religion that's what it meant that's what that word meant how many preachers out there do you think

01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:43.920
Neil how many priests and preachers know that Paul quoted media how how many do

01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:50.320
you think not many they think because they know about

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:57.119
EP amenities but they know EP amenities was citing media zero I'll bet you I'll bet you

01:52:57.119 --> 01:53:04.280
every I'll bet my degree against every degree at Dallas

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:09.800
Theological Seminary do you hear me I left Dallas Theological Seminary because

01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:17.239
their Creek program was so bad you were there yes I started I started I what

01:53:17.239 --> 01:53:23.079
year is this in their THD program oh I think it was 90s I enrolled in

01:53:23.079 --> 01:53:29.079
their THD program I'm trying to imagine you in Dallas Theological Seminary yeah

01:53:29.079 --> 01:53:35.800
yeah the first day I got there the first day I got there this guy who lived on

01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:42.360
the same floor Ryan came in and he was like can I sit down I was like sure

01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:51.199
brother go ahead and he said can you tell me your secret sins oh wow and I was like no man I got

01:53:51.199 --> 01:53:59.199
some Greek to study to get it I think that's one of the institutions where you have to sign I know does this but and I

01:53:59.199 --> 01:54:05.719
think uh I think they do it too where you have to sign a statement of faith well of course I the statement of faith

01:54:05.719 --> 01:54:13.159
is like you will you will preach Jesus Christ was crucified and Rose in the third day like that's that you're

01:54:13.159 --> 01:54:18.280
signing that for your degree yeah and we're they still do that in

01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:25.199
2023 yeah I didn't I didn't get that far so mindblowing I didn't get that far though

01:54:25.199 --> 01:54:30.440
I don't think you would have ever you would have agreed to that would you even back in the 90s you probably no but I

01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:35.679
was getting so you see I had had a bachelor's in classics by this point

01:54:35.679 --> 01:54:42.840
yeah so although I love Jesus Christ and wanted to continue my mission work um

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:50.440
and go through um Dallas the Seminary um I the classics was rooting it s in my

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:56.679
brain and um after a while I was like look their Greek sucks here um they they

01:54:56.679 --> 01:55:03.360
do weird stuff that's kind of touchy Fey weird is that they call it biblical

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:10.599
Greek what's that well you you learn biblical Greek you you're stuck in this box it's only Greek terms that are you

01:55:10.599 --> 01:55:16.599
found in the New Testament or septu right so you don't actually go outside

01:55:16.599 --> 01:55:23.199
and find out where these words mean and what theologies are where they come from do they come from Orpheus do they come from Plato do they come from Homer

01:55:23.199 --> 01:55:28.599
you're looking at it saying oh this word shows up in the septu agent and now it's being used in the New Testament so it

01:55:28.599 --> 01:55:36.040
only can It only could mean these certain things you're stuck in a box right biblical Greek what's that yeah I

01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:41.960
had a I had a bachelor's degree in Greek and Latin it was in a Classics

01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:48.000
Department right and it was in Greek and Latin I double majored right I did both

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:53.599
and um what was funny was going from that at a major university I went to the

01:55:53.599 --> 01:56:03.440
University of Arizona and go wild cats and um anyway um I after um getting that

01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:08.520
technical exposure um I was able to go to Seminary

01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:15.920
and see right away I mean the world that they live in with their language is so

01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:23.639
unscientific if you I have students come to me from um biblical uh classes they're taking

01:56:23.639 --> 01:56:29.280
you know they got to do so much biblical Greek right um and I get them and I have

01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:36.679
to sit them down I have to reprogram them and I have say look this is a science so you know you can you can stop

01:56:36.679 --> 01:56:44.920
messing around and you can learn the fundamentals right and I can take somebody like that and and train out the

01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:51.119
the bad that Seminary gives them but it all comes down down to acts again the

01:56:51.119 --> 01:56:57.840
book of The Acts of the Apostles when the people saw them talk when they saw Peter and John talk they

01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:04.760
said there two things number one they're illiterate and number two they're

01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:10.239
stupid right and they I went

01:57:10.239 --> 01:57:15.719
toal the one passage I that's what I found at Dallas Theological Seminary it

01:57:15.719 --> 01:57:21.599
reminds me of the page where where Paul where they walk up to Paul the stoics and uans are sitting in Athens I'm

01:57:21.599 --> 01:57:28.159
picturing them you know with their beards like like mine right now and they're wearing their togas and these are some strange Notions you bring to

01:57:28.159 --> 01:57:34.560
our ears tell us more and then and then it says he told them more and some of them were like oh

01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:40.159
I gotta go and only a few stayed behind and I'm laugh I'm laughing because I'm like this

01:57:40.159 --> 01:57:47.440
is probably true this sounds like a true Tech this is I think that part is historical that's a funny text it's like

01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:53.840
Paul's sitting there in Athens going I want to tell you about Jesus and they W they all walk up and say huh this is

01:57:53.840 --> 01:58:01.800
some strange Notions you bring to our ears go on go on Sir tell us well he resurrected oh I gotta

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:07.040
go I'm out of here and he's looking around at their statues and he sees one

01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:12.560
of them says to an unknown God you know uh and it's it's probably it's probably

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:19.840
Theos hipos right the unnamed God and there he's looking around saying that's that's him that's ours we yeah we have

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:25.599
the same one so funny I I don't know that's how I read that part and people

01:58:25.599 --> 01:58:32.119
think people than Neil that this guy Paul is a genius oh he's a this is the

01:58:32.119 --> 01:58:38.840
author of the Romans and they talk about him like who ha ho ha dude um I've read

01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:47.119
lots of classical authors lots of people before Paul and after Paul and I can tell you for a fact I wouldn't put Paul

01:58:47.119 --> 01:58:52.480
in the top 67 70 authors um that I know

01:58:52.480 --> 01:59:00.400
from Antiquity who could you know whose Works make his look kind of like

01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:05.480
brainwashing yeah he's crazy he's out of his mind talking about yeah you need the

01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:11.480
nosis you need to he says in Corinthians nosis speaking in tongues

01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:17.119
and prophecy if you don't have you you have to have all three but if you don't have all three you got to have faith too

01:59:17.119 --> 01:59:23.000
and if you don't have faith then you don't have all three but if you all three and you have faith then you're good like it sounds like he's going

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:29.920
crazy when you read you read Corinthians it sounds like someone going crazy you know he's being backed by the purple

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:36.239
right he's got Lydia and all the backing that he needs for that so okay I understand that's what's financing what

01:59:36.239 --> 01:59:41.480
he's doing um but I think I think he was bringing those good Eastern drugs to the

01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:47.280
Greeks and that's why they're like yeah all right we'll fund your project come on in come come to Corinthians and start

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:52.639
a church here bring some of that good Egyptian uh some good Arabian you know

01:59:52.639 --> 01:59:57.679
whatever you got he was pushing the Venom he was pushing the Viper Venom

01:59:57.679 --> 02:00:03.800
baby I mean if he's having visions of the seventh heaven he's you know he's done we know what that means you and I

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:10.639
know what that means yeah the yeah the angel came to him yeah the angel came to he fled up to the seventh heaven he said

02:00:10.639 --> 02:00:17.119
or the third heaven he said all right we know how you got there there's only one way to get there there's only one way to get to the

02:00:17.119 --> 02:00:22.560
third heaven to float up to the third heaven and what's funny is people who follow

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:29.239
the fairy tale I mean think about somebody trying to make just simple

02:00:29.239 --> 02:00:36.000
think of a very simpleminded person somebody who's really concrete really down to earth and just

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:42.400
straightforward right and Paul says I got boosted up to the soand so heaven

02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:49.119
and there I was and right and what is this person trying to what did you see him get struck by the snake that thing

02:00:49.119 --> 02:00:55.280
didn't hurt him he's got this guy's pushing the thorn that's what they call it this guy's pushing the

02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:01.639
thorn right so he's one of those freaking Pirates yeah remember we looked

02:01:01.639 --> 02:01:08.400
up the Buckthorn in Greek the aanta and then it said like ACAA Roots as as on

02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:15.360
the bottom on uh uh what we we call what's the website um uh percus tffs it

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:20.400
defined it defined that exact drug uh drug as

02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:27.719
like that's DMT right there that's crazy I didn't even know that until that's why I love that website but um Paul yeah oh

02:01:27.719 --> 02:01:33.560
and and I think whoever wrote James they say it's James or whoever someone else maybe that wrote James whatever whatever

02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:39.360
the case is I'll just say James James just says text says James I'm just gonna call it James anyways whoever wrote that

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:45.639
was responding to Paul talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and saying you don't know what you're talking about dude all your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about

02:01:45.639 --> 02:01:52.800
faith cares he goes even demons have faith who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about faith I

02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:58.639
love that text dude I mean was he the one one of those jameses got thrown off

02:01:58.639 --> 02:02:04.159
the Temple Mount yeah that's the one yeah was that what do you have to do at

02:02:04.159 --> 02:02:12.719
work to piss people off so much they throw you out of the building I don't know what any ideas probably super

02:02:12.719 --> 02:02:18.040
high probably probably just bothering everybody for being too high here we go here's the text right here I'm sharing

02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:25.440
my screen on the right if you can pull it up he says you believe that there's one God good even

02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:31.000
demons believe that like who it's basically like the way

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:38.040
it's supposed to be written the way it's supposed to be this is supposed to be um uh sarcastic the good part so tell me

02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:43.639
this Neil tell me because I really want to expand on this and then um I'm gonna

02:02:43.639 --> 02:02:49.599
call it um the bonic Empire is you're reading all of these sources

02:02:49.599 --> 02:02:57.280
um and you're finding out that there's all of this you kind of get the sense of what bonic worship is hits this area at

02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:03.360
this time hits thieves hits um Rome um

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:08.960
any oh Baptist too there's an organization yes and the Baptist is part

02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:16.480
of it it's all part of the same movement right there's an organization to this isn't it that um people are not I think

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:23.800
the oracular structure is what's keeping because those oracles are the ones you're giv orders to say go do this

02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:31.360
Colony yes you can go to war you know even when Athens is fighting with Sparta is as late as that right Classical

02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:38.800
Greece what what ha um what happens you know it's all oracles right the you know

02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:46.480
they they're General it's always women that perform the oracles yeah those generals are listening to is that funny

02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:52.079
how isn't that funny how in the ancient world it's we always talk about patriarchy and uh

02:03:52.079 --> 02:03:58.760
you know how women don't have roles in these religions these modern Islam and Christianity in the ancient world they

02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:03.880
had ordained women do in these high roles of high priestesses handling the

02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:11.719
snakes the serpents and handling the drugs and giving the oracles to these Kings and these generals telling them

02:04:11.719 --> 02:04:19.840
what to do they were way ahead of their time I'm telling you democracy all that stuff Athena the image of Athena nurva

02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:25.119
you see that you go to Independence Hall in Pennsylvania or in Washington DC and

02:04:25.119 --> 02:04:31.239
you see manura Lady Liberty that's all ancient democracy from

02:04:31.239 --> 02:04:36.760
Athens and like they had they were way ahead of their time you know what I mean

02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:42.440
you think we'll be able to keep that all in with this final question and thank

02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:49.520
you for coming tonight this has been absolutely wonderful final question for you I'll let you wrap with this this

02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:57.440
tell me now you've told us everything about the past tell me now about the present and the immediate future are we

02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:04.960
gonna be able to keep Liberty or is the government gonna be

02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:11.280
challenged and overthrown we're keeping

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:16.920
it because it all the Liberty always prevails look at history even if there's

02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:22.599
a dark time even there some dark that rise up eventually eventually Athena

02:05:22.599 --> 02:05:30.480
always wins so that's what I'll that's what I'll say that's my that's my Oracle as long as we recognize that we

02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:39.159
can go backwards that it is possible and funny thing is this happens when groups

02:05:39.159 --> 02:05:44.920
like oh I don't know who did it in the third and fourth Cent Oh

02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:52.679
Christians when the Christians challenge the government they were able to get a person to

02:05:52.679 --> 02:05:59.880
endorse them A desperate guy named Constantine I think he had orange hair

02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:09.280
and he said right I am now you know part of the whole key row Society right and

02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:15.599
what happened crumble crumble crumble and everybody's like what the Julian that you mentioned tonight the

02:06:15.599 --> 02:06:22.480
Christians you you have to understand people out there Julian the emperor that Neil mentioned tonight right who's one

02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:28.840
to save the world tried to save the world tried to save the world tried to save civilization and and and I gotta

02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:35.000
say this because the way the Christians treated the Jews for a, 1500 years was

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:41.000
real rough forcing them into ghettos basically treating secondhand CIT they weren't Roman citizens they had to be

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.360
treated like different like animals right Julian who wanted to bring the

02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:51.920
ancient riots back said is Jerusalem belongs to the Jews he wanted to build

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:58.599
the temple again that was that's in the set it's in the sources so he this guy really did want

02:06:58.599 --> 02:07:04.239
to keep the world back into its balance and where where it was supposed to be he said that Yahweh that's their that's

02:07:04.239 --> 02:07:11.360
that's Israel let them have their God let Alexandria be ruled by carapus let Athens be ruled by Athena he had this

02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:17.400
system that he was envisioned what it's supposed to be he that you got to give

02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:22.920
like that's true you know you got to give him credit especially since all of

02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:28.800
his male relatives were executed by the Christians when he was just a tiny kid

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:37.639
the only reason he was alive was it would look too bad if they killed a child right and sometimes we can walk

02:07:37.639 --> 02:07:44.000
over that line right but it all M it makes us all queasy okay so your vote is

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:51.280
we keep Lady Liberty here we follow Justice we we we shed the blood of

02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:58.679
tyrants onto the tree of Liberty to make our Republic stand you're cisero who who

02:07:58.679 --> 02:08:04.480
do I get to be uh who do I get to be I want to find out who I am but yeah I'm

02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:09.520
cister then are you coming with the opposite no I want to be with you no I'm

02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:14.840
I want to keep the Republic you know yeah you got your dagger you're

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:20.159
Brutus cisero and Brutus no I love glad you said that I I was hoping you would

02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:26.440
say that because that I think they were on the right I mean Caesar whatever Caesar is Caesar you know whatever he's

02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:33.159
great General and and the emperor but he was on the wrong side of history in my opinion ciso was on the right side of

02:08:33.159 --> 02:08:40.239
History that's just my opinion I've read a lot of this sources I'm a big fan of of Lucian Civil War and I'm big fan of

02:08:40.239 --> 02:08:47.599
Cicero I'm big fan of diodorus and oid and uh and Cassie is Doo and all these

02:08:47.599 --> 02:08:53.960
great uh Virgil and my my Come Away with that time period was sis will try to

02:08:53.960 --> 02:09:00.520
save the Republic and that was the way to go yeah who knows what could have happened if they kept that thing intact

02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:07.760
yeah he was trying he was trying he was he put himself um between their past

02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:14.480
Republic and this wave of imperialism that ultimately ultimately wiped them

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:20.400
out they couldn't as soon as the when you make your central power so power powerful that they can do anything soon

02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:27.719
as you get someone in there with no limits everything's going to crumble everything's the only way to maintain a

02:09:27.719 --> 02:09:33.079
a a a government like that is to keep fighting Wars right it's to keep get you

02:09:33.079 --> 02:09:39.480
got to get your Legions out there you got to take more land you got to take more resources that's the only way to keep that type of system going that's

02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:47.000
why throughout the that's why they call it the Dark Ages and the Middle Ages is all the ostrogoths the vandals the the

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:52.119
the Huns all war Warrior cultures trying to kill each other over kingdoms and

02:09:52.119 --> 02:09:58.719
land and when you have a republic with a with a with a um with a senate that

02:09:58.719 --> 02:10:04.119
represents the people at large with vote like you balance the power out more

02:10:04.119 --> 02:10:11.599
there's just a and the Thomas Jefferson and um Thomas Payne they realized this

02:10:11.599 --> 02:10:17.719
after the enlightenment they said those Greeks had it figured out nii was big into the Greeks they though we have to

02:10:17.719 --> 02:10:25.199
go back to they were doing this is the only way like all this other all this Holy Roman Empire crap that's got to go

02:10:25.199 --> 02:10:32.440
everyone's like you either you either are living as a surf or you're a billionaire living in a church like

02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:37.800
trillionaire I'm saying equated to today's money because that's what they were these these high Cardinals and

02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:43.599
Bishops living in they're the only ones that enjoyed life life was only good if you were one of those people to anyone

02:10:43.599 --> 02:10:49.159
else life sucked so one I hate this this new thing that historians do now well

02:10:49.159 --> 02:10:56.239
they'll say the Dark Ages W weren't as dark as we thought it was actually pretty good for who for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who I

02:10:56.239 --> 02:11:01.760
hate that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I push back against that I don't care I still call it the Dark Ages I'm gonna keep continuing to call

02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:08.400
it that yeah prove it prove me otherwise Scotland Edinburgh has a

02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:15.520
wonderful Museum um of the middle-age torture devices that are used to extract

02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:22.880
information from people or just you know if your group is into that if your Brotherhood is into you know beating and

02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:28.079
abusing people you know um this is a good place for it yeah know I thank you

02:11:28.079 --> 02:11:33.320
very much Middle Ages I think I think I'd rather you know fly with the people

02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:40.880
who talked about the Golden Age you know what they said the Romans gold said their golden age was it was the pox

02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:46.719
Romana it was that time when those doors are shut and there aren't there aren't

02:11:46.719 --> 02:11:52.360
Wars right do you cation that's what lukan gets at in

02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:58.960
his farsia where he emphasizes the ter it's the time of Peace when when when

02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:04.119
when people are happy during times of War it's just death and sadness and

02:12:04.119 --> 02:12:10.119
depression nothing good happen nothing good comes from war that's why I see these idiots on Twitter with their

02:12:10.119 --> 02:12:15.239
Alexander the Great um thumbnails and they'll they'll say like Christian

02:12:15.239 --> 02:12:20.880
Warrior and they're like look how based it was back in the back in ancient Rome and they they don't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:26.440
they're talking about none of these people ever had to Pi a spear or a or uh

02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:31.760
St like they have no idea what it was like like Homer Homer made made it clear

02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:38.199
war is not that great it sucks read The Iliad and Homer describes what happens

02:12:38.199 --> 02:12:43.480
when when when um Ajax throws a spear and it goes through somebody and they

02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:50.639
start to blank out and they lose their Consciousness and then they're gone Homer writes that out very vividly Homer

02:12:50.639 --> 02:12:56.920
is trying to tell you war is not fun and achilles was the the symbol of

02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:02.040
how War can really tear people apart

02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:08.079
when Achilles has to kill Hector and a father has to grieve for a son that's

02:13:08.079 --> 02:13:15.840
this is a really that's why they call this text Divine because it's so true yeah Mars Mars lays down with

02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:22.639
Venus right that's that's the thing that's that Roman ideal that's that

02:13:22.639 --> 02:13:29.360
Triad yeah to get to that to perfect civilization that was the

02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:35.280
dream of the Seven Hills right and that stuff was appropriated through time and

02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:41.559
used the Christians have used those images for centuries and distorted them

02:13:41.559 --> 02:13:49.480
just like Julian said he said they're going to distort everything it turns out they did so that the image that we get

02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:55.559
their their Bible times are just totally I mean come on who who believes any of

02:13:55.559 --> 02:14:03.079
