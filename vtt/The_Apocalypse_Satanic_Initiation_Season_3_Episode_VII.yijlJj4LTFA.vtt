to set for us for all of us in the satanic congregation they're going to be able to

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.720
set for us that original history that we're looking for

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.019
Pure evidence it's all we do here is we smoke that evidence

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.260
right that's what we do people are asking what are they doing with this in their

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.980

we can take today to our investigation right let me just remind our audience we're all here

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.580

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.360
you in the advanced core those of you from the Harvard folks I want you to

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.880
focus on like a front get back there see what's going on right we're not talking

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.940
swashbuckling here we're talking good old-fashioned child trade yes and all

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.220
the lamenting mothers in Lanka front who are lamenting their daughters having

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.100
been taken away I want to jump the first thing we're

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.740
going to do is we're going to necromance up an ancient source that nobody ever looks at and you guys this is why you

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.400
love this I know you do nobody nobody touches this guy not with

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:10.919
a 10 football not even the guys who study the field who study the medical side not even they like to touch this

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:18.840
guy I mean die scores is one thing right Galen is one thing my God are we gonna talk

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.020
are we going to talk about Venoms and antidotes and theriac yes

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.419
yes we are yes we are go ahead and bring us up bring us up our first passage for

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:35.819
the day please I just wanted to to take you to limnos

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:42.360
I just want to take you to Lemon Austin this was kind of a little invitation here you got a little Perseus a little

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.880
bit of a little bit of commentary we're talking about lemnos and lemny and Fire

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:55.500
right lemony and fire but let me in fire what is it that's something special living in fire what else is lebanos

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:03.780
known for known for that meal toss it's known for that cure-all it's known

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:09.120
for that antidote it's now for that antidote right why is

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.360
that well maybe maybe we need to look at the lemony and Fire

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:22.380
what is the lemony and Fire yeah it burns when you use it

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.419
but don't worry as our author tonight will explain to you that and there's a

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:34.080
whole bunch of sources this is one guy we don't have a date for right we don't have a date for him

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:41.160
um I'm gonna keep them kind of shrouded mystery a little bit but we don't have a date um orobasius is the one who's recording

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:48.599
this and who's oribasius he's that physician who works with Julian who we all know is

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:55.160
Julian the pot the apostate right so these guys are interested the the

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:01.979
Imperial lines are all interested in preserving the

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:09.419
craft around which they operate right um these Mysteries are performed

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:14.759
in places where the Emperors are the ones using the drugs and how do we know

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:21.840
that we know that from you can just dig up a Roman a physician a Medicus he was called

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.599
attached to the Roman army with Claudius you just grab this guy scribonius just

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:35.279
grab scribbonius and you look at him and you say scribonius tell me about the um tell me about the secret formula and all

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:43.740
the antidotes for them they're using in the rights okay tell me about Augustus what's Augustus using you thought Mark

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:49.019
serbalius was the only opium addict right no no they all were yeah and we've

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:56.339
got the recipe right that Augustus was fond of and these are not symbols these are not

00:08:56.339 --> 00:09:01.560
simples when the people who are finding the hair right who are out there in the field

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:09.720
doing their job when they find those chemicals thank you very much that's a service to humanity

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:16.680
when they find those chemicals in there and they want to know what's you know what's the biological activities yeah

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.980
why are these people why do these people have we cannot begin to understand this until

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:30.140
we think not in one dimension right but in

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:38.300
multi-dimensions what are they using these for they're using constellations of drugs yes drugs have constellations

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:46.320
and for those of you like Rich who are into such things into the the physics

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:52.220
the physics behind the kaldi and Magi right

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:57.480
anybody's interested in anything like that is going to appreciate the level of

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:04.740
expertise it takes right the reason people are surprised about the drugs in the hairs because you know this is not

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.440
an area that classicists have studied yeah I'm gonna go back to a text tonight

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:16.320
I'm gonna bring it to you it was edited in the early 20th century

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.200
right like 1906 1907. wait a minute that's the last time

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:28.560
anybody has serious yeah it is the dude's name was Max velmann

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.980
yeah and anyway there's a whole Corpus that the German classical Scholars of

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:41.940
the early 20th put together and we have all of these documents I'm going to be showing you and be showing

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:47.700
you one of and in these we can look at the constellations of drugs that are

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:53.040
being used this hair is much more than we think it

00:10:53.040 --> 00:11:00.120
is this hair is much more than we think it is it will tell us what they are

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:07.440
using it will tell us what rights are being propagated it will tell us

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:14.820
people said where's this it's a shaman put that smelly Shaman back in the closet we're talking colleges of Bronze

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:21.300
Age priestesses called a hidden eye they have a word for these people right

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:28.980
they have a word the EO baloy they call their God the cat the poor of the EOS

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:35.399
right yeah the one who has that the one who

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:40.579
has that EOS these are the people saying

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:50.880
yeah these are the bakkens these are the mean ads these the ones with staying hands the

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:57.180
purple those who are in in service to I Terny toss

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:04.860

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:38.100
Corpus medicorum gricorum here it is this is all online thank you very much thank you very much this is all the

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:44.700
stuff it comes out of Leipzig right and here's a little bit of the introduction right probably facio looks they wrote it

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:50.339
in Latin isn't that nice that way we don't have to uh know any

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:59.880
German anyway um max came across this Vatican copy of

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:06.959
pseudo diascores and it was so happy to get his hands on it you know what I mean it purports to

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:14.120
be a phyluminous right phylum is a little book and the title is and that's where you see the Greek there peritone

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:21.260
Zone oh isn't that nice kaiton in our toys

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:29.180

eobolic living creatures yes and their boy thematone

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.300
right the powers the things that they have you can say it's a Curative right

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:49.500
so look where you are I just want to stand back now for the people for the for the kids from

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:55.139
the ivy league right remember that we're dealing with a little more sophisticated

00:13:55.139 --> 00:14:02.220
we're dealing with very well established shipping of these ingredients right you

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.920
can find this stuff all over the Mediterranean don't think that you have to look for local plants right from the

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.519
any analysis you get of what chemicals were there don't immediately say oh we get if it's not growing here no no

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:19.620
that's not you're going to find that hair dye that you found that red ocher

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:25.380
you're going to find that lemony in Earth that lemon and Earth you know what lemon

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:31.680
and Earth is you can buy them in little what you and

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:39.300
I would call pills or suppositories or or uh lozenges yeah you can dissolve

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:45.480
these things and wine you can put them in your rectum it's the way people take medicine Antiquity and you know it's

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:51.300
down to a pretty exact science um you've got these things stamps you

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:58.620
know with the physician of who's pedaling them right so you know anyway galen's out dealing drugs right he's out

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:03.720
buying drugs on limnos he's like dude these guys have what it takes they've

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:09.440
got the crank right so he goes out to them and he's looking for this miltos

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.579
he's looking for it he wants to know about the fire he wants to know about

00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:19.920
the blood and he asked them about the blood of the goat and they laugh at him right the

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:27.360
locals do because he didn't know what he's doing right this is Galen and these are the locals on limnos yeah

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:34.560
laughing at him good good does everybody see what direction we're going let's go back to here let's go to this one Julie

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:41.279
thanks a lot yeah yeah I just want you to see at the end of his preface right he comes the

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:47.220
end of his preference but his preface there and he gives thanks to all those great people that you know helped him

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:52.260
out and humanitarian you know people or was he in the project of helping him in

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:59.459
this you know good for them yeah the ones who help them with this addition look at the names there okay these are

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:05.040
deals right villamovitz yeah okay so I

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.320
thought that was nice thank you MOX for giving us this text

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.959
um let's look at a little bit of phyluminous here I want to see give me that that nice title page again well

00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:24.060
that's okay here let's show the folks this um this is a list uh of the chapters right and this is the

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:31.519
later chapters I didn't I gave you I just want you to see um here you can just run down this list

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:40.680
hospitals those are all snakes

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:48.180
yeah those are all snakes shapes hudros Brewing do we know the species of these

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:54.600
snakes we have to go to people like this guy in order to identify them look under the

00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:00.899
Lambda right dracon well how does a dark on differ from a deep sauce

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:07.020
right and the president and you're not now as a classicist you have to kind of

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:14.520
step into a more scientific right world you know that and that's why you guys avoid these texts I mean am I

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:20.640
wrong no you know I'm not wrong um and now that you've now that you know

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:26.220
that people are using drugs and Antiquity maybe maybe all that Flack

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.679
that you gave everybody who said that they were um maybe you should shut up

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:37.380
yeah I just told Harvard and Yale and not Princeton because they cut their own

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:44.520
head off and killed their Greek program you bozos you incredible incredible

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:50.460
bozos flash something up here scary is there anything we put up here put a put a bit

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:59.160
face again give us a face right this is what yeah this is what you people deserve just flash something yeah come

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.919
on Chewie there we go well I'm saying my little thing here leave it up there this is for the people at Princeton who have

00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:11.220
just decided believe it or not this is incredible not just now but months ago maybe a year

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:18.120
um they decided to kill their Greek program they decided to kill it why because it's the language of the oppressor you know

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:24.140
why those people are committing suicide and doing you a disservice

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:29.340
because they're taking these texts away from you and doing so

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:34.620
um uh uh they're doing it because they're insane right they're insane this

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:40.980
is an insanity this is an insanity you are not there you people at Princeton

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:46.679
you are not there to do anything but guard the texts you are not there to do

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:53.520
anything but keep that museum open and the only

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.799
way to do that is through the Greek if you can't do it because it's too hard

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:04.860
you should admit it and you should say we're just gonna study this in Translation and have

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:11.400
ancient Mediterranean civilization courses now a lot of professors out there will know will know that what I'm

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:16.860
saying is correct and they will say good for you for doing it but they will do so

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:22.080
very quietly okay so what do we have to say to the rest of the kids that are here the ones

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:30.600
that aren't from the ones that aren't from Princeton let's look at the drugs and how they are used in order

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:36.660
to get a better idea of this profile

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:43.700
what these people are doing what these monarchans are doing right and not just them but everybody

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:49.020
across the Mediterranean this is not the only place in the world they've got

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:54.900
drugs remember you can buy this stuff you can buy North African Viper Venom in Rome

00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:00.660
yeah I can get up in the morning I can walk down to the market I can see the

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:08.460
Stalls they set up they have plaques for their for the type of stall they're using right Dr so and so and they sell

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:15.120
their drugs like medications they don't say dark Medicus and sell their drugs

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.820
all right they go all their different all they're different pills that are dissolved in wine or stuck in your

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:27.299
rectum they've got all the oils all right you can put on the skin did you know they've got stuff that you plaster

00:20:27.299 --> 00:20:32.340
your skin Oh this is good I'm I'm ruining that I'm ruining the show I

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:39.480
gotta keep going let's go to the next yeah here we go I just wanted you to see this is concerning those those EO boy

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:45.000
right this is those poisonous animals right at the top right those poisonous living things and what they're doing

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.100
okay look at this word right in the beginning of this Treatise we deal with

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:56.160
loose Lissa or lusao is the verb it's a contract nice contract

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:04.100
um and it means to Rave or be mad and it look at them Roman numeral number two of dogs to suffer from rabies right because

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:11.520
this is the context we see the Mad Dog in right okay and how what do we do with

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.980
the Mad Dog well we know that there are substances that can induce Madness and

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.980
can stifle Madness and now for those of you who are classists who are thinking oh wait a

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:28.860
minute didn't they give hell board to somebody that caused the daughters of somebody not to get not to stop going

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:34.919
crazy yes they did and do you know why because

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:44.220
these iracular priestesses and colleges are taking your sanity and balancing it

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:50.580
balancing it with the use of their chemicals yes yes right those drugs that

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:55.620
were in that Bronze Age find those drugs are not the good

00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:02.159
hallucinogens right those drugs are the scary hallucinogens so why would you want that in your system in the first

00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:08.460
place why would you want the lemny and Fire okay let's go to Heracles this is a

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:15.720
transl uh this is just a translation go to the um this is just the dips asses the

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:21.960
therion right and I just wanted you to see we're gonna we're gonna look at a description here this first paragraph is

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:29.820
just a description of the dips house and apparently he's short he's only about a length of your arm yeah and he's got

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:35.039
these black spots on them with a kind of a Tawny amberish Brown that kind of

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:41.400
thing color yeah okay anyway um this is how we start to get into okay

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.440
what well who's who's using this and what you know is are these about just

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:52.919
bites that people are picking up or what are are these things that no no these are part of compound recipes we do have

00:22:52.919 --> 00:22:59.159
bites right and you can include the bite of an arrow to be the very same

00:22:59.159 --> 00:23:05.340
the very same uh Administration right this is from like a Fraun I just want

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:11.940
you to look about halfway down the end of the line and would that my father had not spurned

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:17.280
the nightly Terrors of the Oracle of isakus and that for the sake of my

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:24.120
Fatherland he had made a way with two in one Doom ashing their bodies with lemony and fire

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:29.539
wait what ashing their bodies with liberty and Fire

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:36.419
uh yeah what what does that mean what does that mean hey look at here this

00:23:36.419 --> 00:23:43.980
just let's bring up Achilles uh excuse me Heracles a few a few a few lines later right what happened to him right

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:52.080
whom the hide of the lion made invulnerable by the bronze in battle and who possessed but one pass to Hades and

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:59.880
the dead wait wait he had a path to Hades and the dead okay you begin to see the resurrection

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:06.780
right right okay fellow necromancers here we are don't don't start to scare the kids they're just here to find out

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:11.820
what those drugs were doing right who possessed but one path to Hades and the

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:17.480
dead that which the scythian quiver covered

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:25.740
oh do you like that yeah the lemony and Thunderbolt the lemny and

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:32.700
Thunderbolt why am I picking on limnos and why am I picking you guys don't know it but Odysseus is a huge drug user

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:38.220
right Odysseus is a huge drug user you don't know it because you don't read authors

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:43.620
like the Candor the Candor is a poet who is a

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:51.299
priest who is a master of the theriac and the drugs that are used in Ritu

00:24:51.299 --> 00:24:57.360
within the ride itself so um that's some of the information we get through those sources that your typical

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:03.299
classes are not going to get right it's a it's a sad and a shameful thing but

00:25:03.299 --> 00:25:08.700
it's the way life is I want to look at a couple more of these tanks oh

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:15.059
um uh what do we have here something jumped in here I think I I'm feeling

00:25:15.059 --> 00:25:20.220
queasy or something what is this oh it's ax it's ax right it's the Acts of the

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:27.120
Apostles rightes oh no this is where Paul is

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.460
having his shipwreck yeah and he comes to melite

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:38.340
the island see that in the first line melite comes to Malta

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:44.940
perhaps there was some miltos involved all we're doing is are we

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:50.580
changing vowels yeah we're just tuning vowels don't worry about it it's all connected where is this place remember

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:57.779
those pirates that we talked about who were trading the drugs and trading the children this is on their way

00:25:57.779 --> 00:26:05.220
between Africa and Italy isn't that nice that's gorgeous I love this so it ends

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:11.340
up being a place where there are these bottle away and Paul ends up washing up on shore and

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:17.159
these barbaroy these locals are like hey let's give this guy a hand and they

00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:23.820
start doing nice things before I build them a fire right and and why because

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:30.480
it's cold and rainy right and so um Paul goes to get some wood right and he's

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:38.179
putting it on the fire when this is the one two three fourth line down about a third of the way in

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:46.679
fusa this Viper jumps out from the fire right and

00:26:46.679 --> 00:26:52.559
grabs on to his hair to his hand and the Barb bottle oil the next line

00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:58.200
Aden they saw it they saw it holding on to the thalion right we just saw in the

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:05.760
passage before we just saw the description of the thalian and what its venom does

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:12.600
okay so here's another Stadium grabbing on to Paul when he's in Malta right and

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:20.419
they said to each other pontos this is a beautiful line this guy there's no way this guy is not a murderer

00:27:20.419 --> 00:27:26.340
why why because after washing up from the sea DK

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:33.960
with a capital Delta DK look at it fourth line from the bottom near the end DK the goddess

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:39.960
right she's not gonna let him live after all that he's been through she's not going to let him live he must be some

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:46.260
kind of you know he's got some blood guilt on his hand or he's got something right if you're hearing a little

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:52.440
religion in this okay yes yes right remember the Christians

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:59.220
the Christians the monotheists are the atheists

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:06.960
right you can't be a monotheist without rejecting every other God but one

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:13.620
and if DK Justice is a pagan polytheist God

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:18.960
right you don't Eros you don't you don't accept Eros you don't accept DK how can

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:25.799
I trust you how can I trust you not to revolt and take over the government right how can we trust you if we're in

00:28:25.799 --> 00:28:31.980
the first century Rome we know what Nero is using you you classicists out there we have Nero's

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:37.919
Private Stock we have his recipe you are sitting you

00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:45.559
are sitting on the cure to cancer you're sitting let me let me say it again because it sounds like

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:51.140
it's out there you are sitting on the cure to cancer

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:56.460
you're sitting on the revolution in medicine you're sitting on the future

00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:03.960
of what you'll be doing as soon as I'm telling you as soon as the molecular scientists right can model this stuff

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:09.600
can do the computer modeling for what's going on with all these substances

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:15.299
yeah your time is done it's a new world it's a new world the London time instead

00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:22.620
of my work that it was the Last Frontier of Classics right that was after coming to hear a paper that I gave I can tell

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:29.039
you for a fact this will be your doom if you do not

00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:34.500
become Guardians of the text yes if you do not become Guardians of

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:40.559
the text let's get a little bit more I sound a little too preachy I don't mean to be preachy

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:47.340
um back to Paul's thing here though um I just want you to notice the guys that said hey he got he got bitten and

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:53.100
he's not you know um he's he must be you know not a not on

00:29:53.100 --> 00:30:00.899
the good side of Justice right um they said we're they're expecting him

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:06.779
to him they were expecting him to do this

00:30:06.779 --> 00:30:14.460
they were expecting him yeah let's bring down the there we go they were expecting him to want to burn up to blow up to

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:22.799
distend in most translations you'll see some kind of swelling going on here but when you were talking about the use of a

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:28.679
Venom when there is a Venom involved we are now squarely in the verb pratho

00:30:28.679 --> 00:30:34.320
which is the root P row town I know it's a Theta but it's

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:40.080
an aspirated Theta that's the P row Tau root and just like the sigma Tau row

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:49.080
root or the Str root that is the central Beating Heart of the orphic cult

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:57.600
um so is the P row Tau the P rotal plays the same root the Sotter does right so

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:04.260
tear uses that by the way so Taylor is the first right the sotela is the first

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:10.620
she who saves comes before he who says yeah and how do we know that look into

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:17.820
the firmament look into the stair look into the stairs

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:23.670
looking through the Stella oh man and you can see the virgin

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:31.919
[Music] every time every time yeah stata look at it classes my fellow

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:36.980
classes look at these texts look at these tags you need to

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:42.480
comprehend because people now I'm going to say this is

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:49.919
are you listening I'm gonna say this okay get ready get ready glasses

00:31:49.919 --> 00:31:57.360
they are using people as manufacturing devices

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:03.299
for drugs yes yes and they're doing it a very sophisticated way

00:32:03.299 --> 00:32:08.460
within colleges wow so when we find

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:15.440
the hair that is painted that we see those dimetrine priestesses

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:21.299
yes when we see that they've got the meal toss that they've got the meal toss

00:32:21.299 --> 00:32:26.399
in their hair and why is that it is it is for erusibe

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:33.659
it is for her it is for Demeter that gold those golden grains

00:32:33.659 --> 00:32:42.840
it's waving those fields of golden grains right yes that uh um is

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:49.500
the lingo of a whole bunch of sophisticated biochem it's a whole bunch of

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:54.600
sophisticated religion it's a whole bunch of cult and there's a good reason

00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:02.940
that they all use that burning purple right as their base there's a reason for that

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:08.220
now what is this what light does this shed on Jesus and that naked kid because

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:15.000
that's what it's all about you didn't come here you didn't come here to talk to Philomena find out how do you treat

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:23.279
your how do you treat your um your body who is now

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:28.620
um under the influence of too much Spanish fly right and is having a

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:33.840
problem um what do you do to bring that down what do you do to bring down the level

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:38.940
of mania right and somebody's somebody's mental

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:46.380
state how do you cause you guys from you guys from the ivy league did you know you didn't

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:52.820
did you know that women were able to control these these women at Cambridge

00:33:52.820 --> 00:34:01.080
says it from Athens and sat around in their homes and did nothing right regardless of the great Athena

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:06.840
hmm we find out that those women were able

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:12.240
to modulate their level of bleeding during menstruation

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:19.618
yeah that's sophisticated it sounds like something you would want to be able to do well it turns out

00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:26.158
they're on the religious side they're doing this very same thing remember these are all the oyster manias brought

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:32.580
about by a cult that is treating birth right that is heralding in birth they're

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:37.638
the ones who are that you call on right you can get their drugs to

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:42.960
induce birth to induce birth act like oxytocin

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:48.480
injection give somebody a bolus of oxytocin right get that contractions

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:55.760
going they know it too they're doing the same working the same Pathways right but it's this group of Highly skilled women

00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:04.460
that develops these rights so um when we see that the

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:11.460
Earth that fire that balances that serpent that Venom

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:16.400
yeah and we see the bronze foot

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:22.640
yeah and we see her with her lingerie on

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:30.660
bringing in the apocalypse that Morning Star yeah we gotta start thinking

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:39.240
Bronze Age we've got to start looking one of the things that I noticed I had the distinct pleasure in in my education

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:44.579
of working of working on Linear B

00:35:44.579 --> 00:35:50.900
yeah with none other than Emmett Bennett who you know is involved in cracking it

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:56.820
and I thought it was hilarious that the the more I looked

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:02.339
the less I could find that didn't have something to do with drugs

00:36:02.339 --> 00:36:09.599
yeah the shipment of The Ordering of the storing of different drugs

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:14.640
so that when I came to people and said they were using drugs and Antiquity and

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:19.820
they said Mr Hillman the Romans just wouldn't do such a thing

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:26.099
right that's the ignorance kitties from the Ivory Tower that you have been

00:36:26.099 --> 00:36:31.740
subjected to now it's time to pull your heads out

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:39.420
it's time to look at these texts and to see the sophistication for what it is when you see the multi-dimensional poly

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:44.460
pharmaceutical approach you might understand something about

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:50.040
those Medusa you might understand something about all that poison culture you might understand

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:56.099
something about urinating them ejaculating

00:36:56.099 --> 00:37:03.240
um drinking the sweat yes yes you might see eve even

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:10.440
you might even see Eve and understand you guys know that's not written in Hebrew you know that text is written in

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:15.720
Greek otherwise you wouldn't get centaurs that are

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:22.260
pulled out by the maserates you guys know that right you we have to be

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:30.920
careful with these texts the fact that classes is surrendered the biblical text is why we today have to ask the question

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:38.220
what was Jesus doing in a public park at 4am with a naked boy screaming at the

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:46.380
Roman Squad that had showed up to arrest him saying I am not a child trafficker

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:53.280
yeah yeah you will be surprised when you enter

00:37:53.280 --> 00:38:00.180
into the mystery you will be surprised yeah I love this I love this thank you

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:06.839
guys for coming tonight I've taken more time from the devil than I should have now I'm gonna have to pay for it

00:38:06.839 --> 00:38:14.540
um I encourage everybody with an earshot who wants to elucidate that mystery

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:20.640
I encourage you to get access to these materials I encourage you to pull them

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:27.720
out I will keep bringing you um the Mysteries and people have

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:34.619
requested that I show the Imperial side that we look at some of the cult use of

00:38:34.619 --> 00:38:43.140
drugs among Imperials this is fantastic from stuff that you will not have access to nobody nobody translates this stuff

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:48.660
remember Max Wellman right he's he's a Vatican archive he's like wait a minute

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:58.020

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:03.240
beast when you have seals I got news for you when you've got seals I'm talking to

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:10.619
the evangelicals now when you've got seals you don't even know what those are the classes you don't know what a seal is do you did you know that you stick a

00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:16.920
seal and you rectum stick a seal in your rectum shame on you people

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:22.079
the drugs look up the trojiscoi look at them those wheels that you guys are

00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:28.920
always confusing that the Christians cannot explain that's just words for

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:35.760
um a specific type of drug applicator yeah it's just the way that the drug is

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:42.839
dispensed you got didn't even know did we have I'm sorry I gotta show this there's one more maybe I didn't include

00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:48.040
it but I really know I really wanted you guys to see oh

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:55.380
[Music] no I forgot it take that down I forgot it shame on me

00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:01.500
um but I wanted you to see the Christ thing I wanted you to know infiluminous is the Christ thing and we

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:08.220
talk about it what do you do when you get christed right what do you do you know why if you get in trouble for if

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:15.300
you get exposed to a Venom that you don't have an immunity to that's your own fault you have not been christed

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:21.780
you have not been christed I guarantee you with as much water as they got out of his gut when they poked

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:28.380
it with a spear after he died prematurely on the cross and suddenly yelling I'm thirsty I'm thirsty and some

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:33.740
lines that are clearly from the papyri Greek I magikai

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:39.960
Thon yeah yeah I guarantee you if you were to have

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:45.359
Jesus's hair you would have drugs and you'd have a

00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:51.660
constellation of drugs that you could then say hey hey wait a minute wait a minute what fits this

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:59.339
constellation what are they using this for yeah it's like a fingerprint you can fit it like a fingerprint and when Jesus

00:40:59.339 --> 00:41:04.500
died prematurely on that cross he wasn't didn't die from the crucifixion he died

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:11.820
before yeah and they're like huh he's dead shouldn't be dead yet all right he's drinking that water

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:17.460
yeah fantastic I want to know why you guys we've we've been over this evidence

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:22.800
before so I don't wanna I don't want to rehash it but as this investigation is

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:28.079
going and let's admit it right we don't have Scotland Yard on our side right we

00:41:28.079 --> 00:41:35.040
need to we need to lay it out to lay out the case with the evidence without any

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:41.760
sort of bias or phony agenda without belonging to any schools or any groups

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:48.420
or any religions or any Cults or any covens

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:54.540
yeah because remember I'm gonna flip on y'all I'm flipping on y'all as soon as they

00:41:54.540 --> 00:42:01.140
come in quisition um well by the way you can open it up on

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:06.900
the witch's side too now I'm just I should stop I should stop no I apologize for taking up more of your time than I

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:12.180
and I'm worthy of I apologize um but we can also create this is a new

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:19.859
mechanism I show you this philological mechanism we can create because the language leaves a trace over time we can

00:42:19.859 --> 00:42:24.960
follow it through say the Middle Ages and we can look at the chemical profiles

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:33.300
in the Middle Ages that are being used and yes we do have them because we know what the witches are always arrested with we have an account of of Michel'le

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:40.079
that talks about in France it talks about that tripod and what the Oracle is doing on what the Sabbat is and what

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:45.839
Lucifer is right we have all of that so we can take those little periods of time

00:42:45.839 --> 00:42:54.359
as well and we can write out a history of how the drugs have been used over

00:42:54.359 --> 00:43:01.440
time we can watch and paint right an accurate portrait now because

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:06.720
we have tracers in these drugs everybody somebody asked me today somebody asked

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:12.720
me today how do you um keep from you know where do you start and how do you keep from getting lost

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:18.240
right you will get lost and you will perish

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:24.780
if you don't hold on in this cave to the line that runs through it and that line

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:31.319
is the science of the pharmacology remember we serve iternitas who stands

00:43:31.319 --> 00:43:39.420
with Nature Nature has left that fingerprint there for us to pull out as

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:44.819
long as we hold on to that reason and we hold on to that line through the cave

00:43:44.819 --> 00:43:49.980
um you know you're bound to get out you won't fall off you know there's places

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:55.920
here where you can fall off and drown right so okay fantastic fantastic I've talked

00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:01.200
