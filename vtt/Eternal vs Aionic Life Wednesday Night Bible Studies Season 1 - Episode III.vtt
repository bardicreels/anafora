1
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.440
<v 2>Welcome back to Lady Babylon. It's good to see you guys here tonight.</v>

2
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.570
We have a great, great short Bible study for you tonight,

3
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.070
and we're so privileged to have two guests, two special guests.

4
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.670
Now it takes a lot to bring them,

5
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.100
but tonight we're going to have,

6
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.910
I'm pointing over here because I've got 'em both tied up on the floor.

7
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.010
Tonight we're going to have Billy Graham. Yes,

8
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.960
welcome, welcome the ghost of Billy Graham. And of course, as usual, our friend,

9
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.820
Dr. Young,

10
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.140
who won't be saying anything due to his ball gag.

11
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.200
So without any further ado, in order to get to the ionic life,

12
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.970
let us now turn to Billy Graham. Billy,

13
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.840
bring it. Oh, come on, Billy. Oh,

14
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.315
I can feel you buddy. I can feel you. Bring me, bring me ionic life. Billy.

15
00:01:58.005 --> 00:01:58.838
Billy.

16
00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:04.595
<v 3>What must I do to have eternal life?</v>

17
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.500
The greatest problem in the world today is sin.

18
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.500
What causes people to hate and lust and have grieve? It's sin.

19
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.770
It's a disease that we all have. The Bible says,

20
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.250
all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

21
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.870
You've missed the mark.

22
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.160
You've broken the law on your way to spiritual death and eternal death

23
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.835
and the judgement . But Jesus said,

24
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.795
I can do something about that. I can change your life.

25
00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:41.280
I can make you a new person.

26
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.995
Jesus demanded that we make a choice. He says,

27
00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:49.770
there are two roads of life, the broad road and the marrow road,

28
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.430
and you must too. There are two destinies, heaven and hell.

29
00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:56.490
Which road are you on? Which master are you serving?

30
00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:03.430
I don't have to be judged. I don't have to go to hell. I don't have to be lost.

31
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.725
My soul has been redeemed. I'm going to heaven,

32
00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:13.060
got to first repent of my sin and receive Christ as my Lord

33
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.110
and my saviour. You have to repent of your sins.

34
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.920
That means to be willing to change your way of living.

35
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.850
You may have no power to do it, but if you surrender to Christ,

36
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.900
he'll give you the power.

37
00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:32.525
How many of you here tonight are broken fed up but you don't know what

38
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.573
to do?

39
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.280
You give your life to Christ tonight and you'll have supernatural help in

40
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.080
breaking those chains that bind you.

41
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.770
God's not waiting to judge you. God's not waiting to condemn you.

42
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.560
He's waiting to receive you with mercy, with love, with open arms,

43
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.810
and forgive all your sins.

44
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.840
There only comes a few times in our lives when Jesus and Nazareth passes by

45
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.870
and we have an opportunity like we have tonight to receive it.

46
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.770
You may never have a tomorrow as far as God is concerned.

47
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.580
There are people here tonight that may never be alive tomorrow.

48
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.380
You may never get gospel again like this.

49
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.470
Or your heart may not be this tender toward God.

50
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.400
Come while you can and don't put it off.

51
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.760
God is waiting to welcome you with open arms to receive you as you

52
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.500
come to him in repentance and faith

53
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.750
symbol and yet could be life-changing tonight.

54
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.270
And all of heaven will ritual us.

55
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.300
<v 0>And with such power.</v>

56
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.640
<v 2>Billy Graham brought you Eternal life.</v>

57
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.500
Eternal life.

58
00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:01.300
Can we see John three 16 please?

59
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.910
Can we see John three 16,

60
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.340
everybody together as our opening reading tonight in this Bible

61
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.430
study? Let's look at John three 16

62
00:05:39.285 --> 00:05:42.025
ion, ion,

63
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.830
what is eternal life? God so loved the world.

64
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.470
He gave his only son, his only born son

65
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.780
ness who had been of, he gave them

66
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.870
for the sake of what?

67
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.330
For the sake of ionic life translated

68
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.550
to you as eternal.

69
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.660
And tonight what I want to show you is

70
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.700
the world where eternal life doesn't exist.

71
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.360
It's nowhere in the Bible.

72
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.830
It is not a promise of eternal life.

73
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.570
It is a promise of ionic life.

74
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.090
What is this thing? Let's see.

75
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.170
Let's see an excellent false derivation of that

76
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.690
more eternal life. Bring us. Bring it on you. Ghosts of the dead.

77
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.730
Bring on more eternal life.

78
00:06:55.955 --> 00:06:58.085
<v 4>Eternal life is there for life</v>

79
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.700
to the food and they shall never perish.

80
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.180
Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. The Bible says burly,

81
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.390
I say he heareth my word and believeth on him.

82
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.010
That sent me half everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation,

83
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.430
but is past from death unto life. Jesus said,

84
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.750
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.

85
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.020
Believe it thou this. And if you believe on Christ, you'll.

86
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.853
<v 5>Never die.</v>

87
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.960
Some people think eternal life means life that goes on and on and on and on and

88
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.845
on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.

89
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.900
So the life they have now doesn't end.

90
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.180
They think life that just continues and doesn't stop.

91
00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:47.270
No eternal life is the rendering, the English rendering of

92
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.683
the Greek zoe.

93
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:57.110
Eternal life is used in the English

94
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.885
language to describe the life that

95
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.440
only belongs to the eternal.

96
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.540
<v 3>The truth is the way of eternal life. We need to be able to follow it.</v>

97
00:08:08.545 --> 00:08:09.965
Eternal life. Eternal life.

98
00:08:10.275 --> 00:08:11.605
<v 6>Eternal life. Eternal.</v>

99
00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:13.486
<v 4>Life. Eternal life. Eternal life. The.</v>

100
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.180
<v 6>Only son, whoever believes in him should not perish,</v>

101
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.990
but have eternal life. Do not keep that life-changing truth.

102
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.270
<v 0>To yourself. And remember, you are love.</v>

103
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.470
<v 2>You are indeed. Now, what is this thing?</v>

104
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.850
They're talking about this ionic life and does it mean

105
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.420
eternal? Let us just go to the ion.

106
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.920
The best place to go is back to the original. Go back to Alice.

107
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:44.510
And by the way,

108
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.360
does anybody notice how that preacher just snuck in a little

109
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.980
bit of Greek? And to you, it's believable, right?

110
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.420
To anybody who spends time reading Greek,

111
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.700
it's transparently bad yet Zoe,

112
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.360
what's eternal life, Zoe? Thank you.

113
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.500
Let's go to ion and see what is this thing? Onic life. What is it?

114
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.480
Let's go to ion. Okay, please. Beautiful. Back to Alice.

115
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:23.130
Alice, tell us, Alice Ion. Oh, lifetime, life,

116
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.210
age generation. Long space of time. Space of time.

117
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.470
Ion personified as the child of

118
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.280
Chronos. Oh, that's nice. That's nice.

119
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.990
I want you to look at just one word in Greek and

120
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.320
let's bring up the ion big ion. Show us with the, oh,

121
00:09:47.785 --> 00:09:51.870
okay. Okay. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Oh, this is gorgeous.

122
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.160
Look right in the middle here. Right here in space and time.

123
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.650
This way. Look right here. This is,

124
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.390
I won.

125
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.560
I won Alpha E Yoda.

126
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.940
And what is that F looking thing? That's a di gamma.

127
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:17.040
Can you say dma? Yes. You know what that di gamma is?

128
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.850
It is from the Ian Greek.

129
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.430
This is a very,

130
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.000
very old word.

131
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.290
I won. And where does it come from?

132
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.470
From 1600 bc.

133
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.353
<v 6>Yes.</v>

134
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.130
<v 2>Wow. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Oh,</v>

135
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:46.080
is that lovely? What is the I one?

136
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.770
What is the I one? Before we can show you the ion,

137
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:54.330
we have to step over the cadavers of the terrible,

138
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:59.160
terrible misconceptions and lies that you have been

139
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.140
fed by people who pretend to know Greek and tell

140
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.970
you, oh, it's from the Greek and it means this and they do not know it.

141
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.320
Can I get a hail, Satan?

142
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.410
Let's see it. Let's see them in there. Foolery.

143
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.610
Let's go. Please show us chewy,

144
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:28.140
show us the false derivation. The third clip that we've got. Yeah.

145
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.780
<v 7>If you know very much about the story of the Bible,</v>

146
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:35.640
you've probably heard that Jesus offers eternal life. Sounds nice,

147
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.030
but what does Jesus mean by eternal life?

148
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.710
<v 6>Well, Jesus adopted this phrase from the Hebrew scriptures in English,</v>

149
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.280
it's translated eternal life or sometimes everlasting life.

150
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.720
But the phrase literally translated from Hebrew is life unto the age.

151
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.540
<v 2>Yeah, yeah. Seriously?</v>

152
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.340
Did he just say that It's adopted from the Hebrew and you people

153
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.230
just sit there and it's adopted from the Hebrew.

154
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.465
I just showed you the my sonian.

155
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.020
They put proto Hebrew.

156
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.070
Is it earliest ninth century bc.

157
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.080
This is not Hebrew. This is not Semitic.

158
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.880
This is Greek in its oldest form,

159
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.560
at least the oldest recovery form we have.

160
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.930
So form right linear is going to go back, but

161
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.960
let them work on their end.

162
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.420
So the Preto Hebrew is to say that this is derived from Hebrew

163
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.160
is tantamount to taking you in a back alley

164
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:51.010
and having way with you. Yes. Very bad.

165
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.280
Shame on these people. Shame on these people.

166
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:58.360
And why do people believe this? Because we have to,

167
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.470
if it logically works out within the

168
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.870
Judeo-Christian mystery,

169
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.780
the languages have to follow each other and that original source has to

170
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.950
be Hebrew. They can't live their universe shatters without that.

171
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.810
The retic sect in the 10th century starts crying out from their graves,

172
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.720
oh, we created you a text

173
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.940
and that tradition has bound you

174
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.160
for a thousand years. Yes,

175
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.370
yes. It's time to wake up. What is the ion?

176
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:41.140
Where do we always go here at La Babylon. We go to the Mewa,

177
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.850
right? We go to the Aryans who call themselves the me.

178
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.830
Yes. All because of this one woman. Where else would we go?

179
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.600
Where else is interesting except Lady Babylon. Seriously,

180
00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.860
love it. Love it. Okay.

181
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.810
Tonight I'd like to bring you a text where we can see the eye on

182
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.910
and to show you that it has been poorly, poorly,

183
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:14.620
terribly mistranslated and criminally perhaps as eternal.

184
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.840
Yes, eternal. Seriously, guys.

185
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:25.180
Okay, let me pull up the me text. This is the fourth Pythian ode,

186
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.480
and it is a record of mades oracle,

187
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.310
of me's, Oracle. Beautiful. Thank you very much. Chewy.

188
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.120
Take it down for a second. What is Me's? Oracle. Me's Oracle as well.

189
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.710
It's one of the oracles of Madea that she handed down from Farrah

190
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:48.970
Santorini. Woo.

191
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.740
This was before the explosion. Yeah. Anyway,

192
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:03.380
she handed down this oracle of the future that

193
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.890
was kept by the That's awesome.

194
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.503
It was kept by the,

195
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.220
and Theia went ahead and released it

196
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:18.200
when the inquiry was there that was relevant to the Oracle.

197
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.690
It was about the founders of Sini and some Yeah.

198
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.050
Stuff in Northern Africa. Good stuff. Anyway,

199
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:32.240
so this is Pen's record of that

200
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.180
oracle and in it we have the word ion,

201
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.110
and I just wanted you guys to see what the ion is.

202
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.105
Ion is rah.

203
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.720
Rah is making sure.

204
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.400
Let's bring up the Greek rah is making sure that everybody is falling in

205
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.750
love with Jason's ship wants to go on the

206
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:58.520
Argo and what are they sailing to do? Right?

207
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.790
He doesn't want them to third line,

208
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:06.260
not third line down on this one. I just want to show you the aisle.

209
00:16:08.955 --> 00:16:12.350
Where'd we go? There we go. Second line.

210
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:16.250
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Word in. I know. Okay,

211
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.840
so there we are.

212
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.430
And he doesn't want them to be staying there with their mothers.

213
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.510
Herod doesn't want them to be staying there with their mothers having an ion.

214
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.190
Aon. What is Aon?

215
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.280
That's something that lacks any sort of danger,

216
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.920
lacks any sort of danger.

217
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.600
Harold wants you to go on the Argo

218
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.780
because she doesn't want you to sit at home with your mommy

219
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:54.530
living an ion that is without danger,

220
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.760
living an ion that is without danger.

221
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.090
Now what's funny is further down the line, Allah,

222
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.860
despite the death, even against death,

223
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.860
they should go to find what?

224
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.110
To find a C stone

225
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.410
to find the best, most beautiful drug.

226
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.550
Wait, the most beautiful drug. Yes, the most beautiful drug.

227
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:28.370
What kind of drug? A drug.

228
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.710
The most beautiful drug of

229
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.405
virtue of ate.

230
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.060
You can't get that. If you're sitting at home with your mommy says

231
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.230
it's good stuff. You got to love it.

232
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.130
People don't realise this stuff is written by women, right? They're like, oh,

233
00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:00.030
all the literature we have is, no, it's not. No, it's not. It's not all men,

234
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:05.040
right? There's great stuff out there, great stuff out there anyway, and yes.

235
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.680
Did you notice? What are they on the journey for?

236
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.390
They're on the journey for the pharmacon. They want that drug,

237
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.670
that drug that leads to virtue. So they go and kidnap Madea.

238
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.610
Logical, right? Right. She's the source.

239
00:18:25.385 --> 00:18:26.218
Okay,

240
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:31.080
so what I want to do next is I wanted you to see that within its

241
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.950
context, and now I want to go to, yes,

242
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:39.690
I guess we're going to pull up Yung now let's get Yung.

243
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.400
Before we do,

244
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.990
can you just show the folks Yung and I want you

245
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:50.880
to, I just want you to thank Red book or leave her know him

246
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.120
and what? Shut up. Yo,

247
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.520
read it. Just read it before he just, okay, put the text up.

248
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:06.330
Let's just do this. Here we go. Are you guys ready?

249
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.980
We're going to be transformed.

250
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:13.110
Why is Philemon a magician? Oh, look,

251
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:17.580
it's got the root of Amond in it. Yeah, that's nice.

252
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.280
Does he conjure up

253
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.670
in mortality for himself? Jung is listening. Do you see what happens?

254
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.780
Jung is listening to you. He's watching you. I told you.

255
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.790
Is he conjuring up immortality a life beyond?

256
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:41.100
He was probably only a magician by profession and he now appears to be a

257
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.640
pension magician. Speak you old fool speak.

258
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:51.780
Who has retired from service? Not that old.

259
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.380
His desirous and creative drive.

260
00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:02.250
Listen, do you know why I beat him now? Now you know why I beat you. I know.

261
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.550
Every once in a while it feels good. Yes,

262
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.130
his des desire and creative drive have expired and he now enjoys his well-earned

263
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.620
rest. Out of sheer incapacity.

264
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:18.510
Like every old man who can do nothing else than plant tulips and

265
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:23.130
water, his little garden, the mat. Okay, now here's where. Just give it to us.

266
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.670
Give it to us. You dirty old man. You dirty old man.

267
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:30.390
I'm going to tell him what you did to your patient. How old was she?

268
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.960
You creep young.

269
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.260
The magical rod. Now get ready for,

270
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.750
get ready for, this is the big stuff. Okay?

271
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.130
All of you, esoteric people,

272
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.770
anybody who's interested in the magic and the necromancy watch what's

273
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.510
going to happen. This is gorgeousness and Gios altogether.

274
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.280
Yeah, I love this.

275
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.900
The magical rod Wait, huh?

276
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.790
Lies in a cupboard together with the sixth and seventh

277
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.120
books of Moses. Wait,

278
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.290
Genesis axis, Leviticus numbers, Deuteronomy. That's five.

279
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.800
I thought it was called a pento. Guess what?

280
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.810
Your world that you thought was so normal there happened to

281
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.640
be other books of Moses.

282
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.420
They just weren't accepted in Elon.

283
00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:41.830
Love it. Okay, we have the eighth. Would you like me to show you?

284
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:47.050
It survives in Greek. Who wants to read the eighth book of Moses?

285
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.430
You know you do. You know, you do. Yeah.

286
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:59.080
Fima has become old and somewhat fever minded. Yes. Okay,

287
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.760
so tell us why is the rod,

288
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:08.740
the rod is laid upon the sixth and the seventh.

289
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:15.010
Perhaps it's the eighth. You could say what kind of rod?

290
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.420
The serpent rod.

291
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:21.190
The serpent wand that Jung brings to you and

292
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.570
profane to you. Remember, he wanted this buried with him, right?

293
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.710
And then released at a specific time. What a,

294
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.413
he's weird.

295
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:35.680
Now you know why restraints are so important with Carl,

296
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.690
with Dr. Jung. Sorry. Don't try to get personal.

297
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:46.720
Okay, fantastic. Let's go on to the eighth book of Moses,

298
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.120
then eighth book of Moses,

299
00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:54.130
and I'm going to read you a section of that and you are going to

300
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.460
perceive ionic life. Are you ready?

301
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.360
None of your people from Harvard are going to give this to you because they

302
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.650
don't use these sources.

303
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.730
Shame on you when you were needed. Harvard

304
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:16.960
Ivy League. Nothing about the ivy in that one. Yeah.

305
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.610
Yeah. Let's see. Okay, I'll read it to you. Let's see if we can find it.

306
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:26.200
Where I'm not quite sure which one. Nope, nope,

307
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.510
nope. Well that's okay. Take it down.

308
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:37.690
I'll read it to you. Please. Let me read it to you. It's from the PGM.

309
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:42.430
You can get it yourself. Hans Dieter bets.

310
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.400
Yeah, it's the edition that Dr.

311
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.260
John Scarborough was one of the many translators for who was the

312
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.520
gentleman that I worked with. Very nice,

313
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.593
very nice.

314
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.360
I call on you the creator of all

315
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.690
or greater than all.

316
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.540
Like that you the self begotten God

317
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.970
who see all and hear all and are not seen.

318
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.160
Okay? Do you have the mental image God that is telling you about

319
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:27.290
calling on that unseen one for you gave

320
00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:31.820
Helios all the glory and the powery the

321
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:36.290
privilege to wax and wane and you have fixed the

322
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.220
courses,

323
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:42.140
yet you took nothing from the earlier born

324
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.090
darkness, but

325
00:24:45.825 --> 00:24:50.540
assign them equality for when you appeared both order or

326
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.610
arose and light appeared.

327
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:57.620
I like that order and light appeared and all things were

328
00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.650
arranged by you. Therefore,

329
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.880
all things are also subject to you

330
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:10.100
whose true form None of the gods can see

331
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:15.350
who take different forms in different visions.

332
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:20.750
Ion of ion. Ion of ion.

333
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.910
Yeah. What ground are we treading here? We're treading here the mysteries

334
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:33.080
and we're looking at the top ion images of

335
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.640
ion images. Where are they? Bring them up. Love it.

336
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.140
Love it. Just keep bringing 'em up me,

337
00:25:40.265 --> 00:25:44.570
forget me and just keep whatever you can bring up of eye on. Yeah.

338
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.030
You'll notice the snake association.

339
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:52.340
You have the robot here for all of you cats who are interested in the

340
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.440
dark side of the esoteric,

341
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:59.780
you'll know the images that are there for those of you who've been somewhat

342
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.280
initiated. Yeah. You'll know. You'll recognise. Begin to recognise them.

343
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:06.380
Show 'em the serpent. Right?

344
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:10.605
The serpent around ion a k, a pH.

345
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:18.290
What is going on with the language? It's the same divinity,

346
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.650
right? phs, bring him up. Oh,

347
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:26.060
take feast your eyes on this guy, right? With the serpent around him.

348
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.110
He's got the wings. Oh, you got to love it.

349
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.290
Does anybody smell Saturn? Yes,

350
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:38.090
you should because this is Saturn hail Satan.

351
00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:45.210
Judaism and Christianity are the children of

352
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.700
satanism. Yeah,

353
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:53.130
the children of satanism. Yeah. Yeah.

354
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.080
There he is for you.

355
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.280
There is ion and if you go into the synagogues

356
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.805
in Israel from

357
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:09.900
the second and first bc, the first and second on Domini,

358
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.900
you're going to find ion.

359
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.330
You're going to find ion the worship of Saturn.

360
00:27:19.995 --> 00:27:24.180
Love it. Love it.

361
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.890
It's good stuff. It's good stuff. So

362
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.470
I just want to hit a couple more texts with you,

363
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:39.120
but as we wrap up then come full circle.

364
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:44.520
This ionic life is a part of the

365
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.353
mystery.

366
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.590
The initiate who enters death and

367
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:56.430
is brought back to life is born again.

368
00:27:58.650 --> 00:27:59.483
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

369
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.970
<v 2>Yeah. You're born again</v>

370
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.670
and that ionic life

371
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.350
is the state that the

372
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.990
initiate enters.

373
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:27.060
It is not the word eternal and the mistake comes through

374
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.343
Latin.

375
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:33.480
It's the church pushing it wo and what wom means and whether

376
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.520
it means eternity toss and it doesn't.

377
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:42.210
The ion Saturn is

378
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:45.000
outside of Chronos.

379
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:51.900
Wait, what? Yeah. Chronos time.

380
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.170
The Saturn,

381
00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.270
Satan is outside of that time.

382
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.910
Yeah. It is only by the castration of Anos that anything

383
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.270
proceeds he has set that time.

384
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.310
I'm first and last apocalypse.

385
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.020
Here we go. Are you ready? Here's the funny thing.

386
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.790
This phs ion is by gendered

387
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.920
is dual. Dual gendered. Yeah.

388
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:34.260
Yeah. Feast on that guys with your serpents on your poles,

389
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.450
feast on that, right? Oh, got to love it. Bring the apocalyptic chapter in here.

390
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:44.170
This is from the beginning of the apocalypse. We're going to go right there.

391
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.820
I'm going to bring it up on my screen here so it's easier on my old eyes.

392
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.060
Yes, fantastic.

393
00:29:58.595 --> 00:30:03.580
In the middle of these lamps was this dude

394
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.770
who was very much like the son of man and he's dressed all the way down to

395
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.180
his feet, right?

396
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:15.010
And he's got this girdle thing That's a

397
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:19.300
bra. Yeah, he's got a bra on.

398
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:24.490
Why I told you fan was the by June one.

399
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:28.810
Nobody ever believes me in that, but look, here is Jesus, right?

400
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.110
We're talking about Jesus and it says in that very time of that first line,

401
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.490
proto Mato, right zoning in, he's got the Z.

402
00:30:36.755 --> 00:30:41.350
He is got the bra and it's around his masto.

403
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:45.400
Right? It doesn't say it's around his stern, his chest.

404
00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:51.010
It says it's around his breasts. It's around his breasts,

405
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.320
and this Z is a very important thing.

406
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:58.810
It is a ceremonial thing worn by

407
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:04.060
priestesses who are collecting the serious

408
00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:08.830
exudate from their breasts for the sake of

409
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:12.100
ritual use. Yeah.

410
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:15.790
Jesus is wearing one in the apocalypse. Jesus is wearing one.

411
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.790
Can you believe that? Okay. Anyway,

412
00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:21.430
verse 14 and his head right?

413
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.850
He's got white hairs on his head and they're white like a lamb and yeah,

414
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:29.815
the snow and his eyes are the flocks fire.

415
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:35.770
That eruption of fire, the flocks.

416
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:40.300
Oh, it's got so much meaning.

417
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:46.000
He's the one that you can't see but appears. Oh, this is fantastic,

418
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.540
and his feet are like bronze. Why does he have the bronze feet?

419
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.850
Because she has the bronze feet.

420
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:57.340
If I show you the vampire text that I have,

421
00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.420
if I show you the vampire text from Mike,

422
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.900
who's the buddy of Vlad,

423
00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.260
the impaler in his perfect cult Latin,

424
00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:15.190
by the way, which in 1450 or whenever he wrote this,

425
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:16.720
maybe it was a little before then, but

426
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:23.560
for the time that was the most outstanding Latin and way too close to

427
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.940
the cult to not be right in the

428
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:33.190
big darn middle of it. But he will tell you and is him to eternity,

429
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:37.780
to he brings you the ion. Yeah. Why?

430
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.690
Because he's the guy who knows the purple,

431
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.880
right? And the use of the purple.

432
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.110
Remember the wings of purple right before in the oracle of Madea,

433
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:53.240
you guys have to read this stuff. You love it. Pinar pit nodes. Okay,

434
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.920
let's go on with the apocalypse and having in his right hand,

435
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.750
what did he have? He had the seven stars. Yeah.

436
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:07.730
And from his stoma toss from his mouth came What? A very sharp sword.

437
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.280
Yeah, very sharp. Yeah.

438
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.690
Des cutting Two ways that's

439
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.860
sometimes rendered is two edged or double-edged,

440
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:25.010
but it literally says cutting two ways

441
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:32.030
anyway and yeah, so he is got a stars and his face, his ups,

442
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.870
his expression, his glare with that light that comes out of your eyes,

443
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:40.220
these are all magic. This is magic physics, right? Yeah.

444
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:45.710
What is it? What is this glare? It's like the Helios. Oh, okay, wait a minute.

445
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:49.610
Now we're getting close to it. Can you smell the sorcery?

446
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.530
Can you smell the drugs?

447
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.700
Can you smell what's going on in the text?

448
00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.750
He's got the bronze feet and all that kind of stuff.

449
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.840
He's got all the witchy stuff there from the PGM,

450
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.480
from the magical papyri.

451
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.770
He's got it all and he's also got the power of the son

452
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:15.650
who is the granddaughter of the son who wears the breast band

453
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.820
that collects the glanine. Who is she? The mewa.

454
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:23.450
The Madea. The Madea.

455
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:28.845
Or when you look in the mirror and you face eddi,

456
00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.780
in order to be in paradise, you got to be facing the mirror.

457
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.940
You got to be facing a dem.

458
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.880
Oh yeah. You begin to see it. Can you taste it?

459
00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.380
Yeah. So yeah, he was dead and alive.

460
00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:52.850
He came back right and put his right hand on him saying Don't be

461
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:53.683
afraid.

462
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:58.940
Now look at how Jesus identifies himself here at verse 18,

463
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.010
17.5 Ego, Amy, I am.

464
00:35:06.265 --> 00:35:09.980
I'm the first and the boom accomplishment.

465
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.150
Finish the finishing. Love it.

466
00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.660
Es eschatology

467
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.850
and the living. He is the living.

468
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:26.210
He's not offering you the zoe,

469
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:30.200
it's the ionian zoe. He's offering you

470
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.760
and the living and I became dead.

471
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.430
Necro and behold am alive.

472
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.000
How do you translate that? It's in the plural.

473
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.930
It says into the ions of ions.

474
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:56.550
There has never yet been written a good English

475
00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:01.530
translation of that expression, and if I were to walk into your pastor's office,

476
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.850
if I kicked down his door and walked in and threw my Greek text in front of him

477
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:06.870
and said, listen,

478
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:11.430
you little braggart tell me what does this expression mean?

479
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.750
He wouldn't be able to. He wouldn't be able to.

480
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:22.350
No, no, yet why? Because they don't read.

481
00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:27.300
They just pretend to anybody who tells you they do Greek. Yeah.

482
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.163
Okay.

483
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.520
It's rich. It's deep. It's deep.

484
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:39.390
You say it with reverence and fear.

485
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:44.010
A classical philologist says that with reverence and fear because they've seen

486
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:44.880
the great,

487
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:49.650
wonderful depths of Greek and they've swam.

488
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.520
They know.

489
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:55.650
They know and respect its beauty and anybody who tells you they

490
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:59.430
know it probably doesn't. They just have had a couple of semesters.

491
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:04.770
I left Dallas Theological Seminary. I went to the president and I was like,

492
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:09.660
look, I just started my THM programme and I have a bachelor's in classics with a

493
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.520
double major in Greek and Latin,

494
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:16.710
so your programme is weak. And he was like,

495
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:20.430
yeah, bra. He didn't say bra or he may have said brother,

496
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.800
but he was like, yeah, bro, it is. He confessed.

497
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.860
It was weak. It wasn't what it used to be.

498
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.410
I had looked at some scholars who'd come there when they were all reading

499
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:32.670
Louis S. Barry Schaefer,

500
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:36.780
and so I knew and it was just weak.

501
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:41.400
Seminaries are weak. They are weak.

502
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:46.320
I went into a seminary and within a very short period of time, two years,

503
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.470
within a very short period of time, I had people saying,

504
00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:53.640
what are these students doing? Their Greek is suddenly fantastic.

505
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:55.980
They don't even have to know that anymore.

506
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.310
He should just been teaching 'em Latin. What's in the popes

507
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:06.150
decrees anyway?

508
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.980
Yeah. Look, he's into the ions of ions.

509
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:16.260
That's a prepositional phrase there into the ions of ions.

510
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:20.700
Yeah. What does it mean?

511
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.160
I'm engaging.

512
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.800
I am that ions of ions

513
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.823
now,

514
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:37.150
for God so loved the world that he gave his only

515
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.350
begotten son,

516
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:43.300
that whosoever believeth going to love the King James

517
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.270
on him should not perish, but have

518
00:38:51.605 --> 00:38:56.230
ion. Interesting.

519
00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:58.323
Yeah.

520
00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:02.530
You have just uncovered a new reality.

521
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:07.930
There is no eternal life that is such an

522
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:11.650
absurdity. It's a self contradicting statement

523
00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:17.170
because the ion is by definition,

524
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.090
especially if you're Pythagorean and you connection to 10, the deck A,

525
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:25.720
does anybody know the deck? A no. Nobody knows the deck ad.

526
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:32.080
Don't eat the kabbala on the way there. Right? Kabbala is later.

527
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.430
It's mediaeval, it's off. Anyway,

528
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:43.240
here we have the fruit and we're looking at it Here we have the ion.

529
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:48.010
The ion is outside. It's outside of the time,

530
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.660
so a definition of eternal for it is sad,

531
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:57.250
is sad, and I can talk about other Greek words used for eternal.

532
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:02.470
I can talk about simple adverb and its roots and the relation to the verb

533
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.303
io,

534
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:07.965
meaning to comprehend or to perceive an

535
00:40:08.555 --> 00:40:11.050
aase being Hades,

536
00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.690
who is the one who was invisible?

537
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:19.210
The perception of the invisibility, the funness,

538
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:23.620
the Saturn, you big. Does everybody see it?

539
00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.210
We're right back to Saturn. The verbs take us there.

540
00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:32.890
The language. The language absorbed. All this stuff, it's like a fingerprint.

541
00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:38.080
The Jews and the Christians worship a

542
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.770
satanic divinity. That's a.

543
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.910
<v 0>Profound moment.</v>

544
00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.490
Christians worship.

545
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:54.130
<v 2>A Satanic divinity.</v>

546
00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:53.900
That's so lovely. Thank you for coming tonight. We had a couple of questions,

547
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:58.430
but I've had so much fun and that's a lot to

548
00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:02.570
absorb and I think what we're going to do this time is just say,

549
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.660
Hey, all of you who are writing in with great questions,

550
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.795
I'm trying to get to them all. It

551
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.150
may take me some time,

552
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.290
and for those of you who have sent me email requests

553
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:20.540

I appreciate it and I will get to all of those

555
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.070
if I have time. I'm trying trying.

556
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:36.650
I love your comments and questions and I will return you a

557
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.230
response within a couple of days. I'll get on

558
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:45.110
find time to get on and take you guys extremely serious.

559
00:42:45.335 --> 00:42:49.640
I appreciate everything and I want you to

560
00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:54.800
have a great week. I'll see you at Satanic initiation. Hail Satan.
