oh if I could have one wish and know that it would come true I wish that God

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.360

going back and forth answering each other you guys are geniuses I know that and I appreciate your time I see your

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.379
comments and I really appreciate your time let's chew it let's pull up that first one but let's give our a shout out

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.480
to the people who are making the experience worthwhile I've heard you

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.640
speak this is from Renee Renee I've heard you speak highly of Medea but in

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.739
the Argonauts she murdered her children is there a different version of her story and then you know strangely enough

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:15.180
the next Comet gave a great response to that thank you user so-and-so he answers

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.400
this in one of the episodes and no she didn't actually kill her kids apparently

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.060
there's a source yeah take it down thanks thank you for doing that that's like you got my back I appreciate that I

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.019
appreciate that there is indeed there are several sources and one of them is alien if you want the controversy you

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:41.099
see it was euripides who was being bribed by the Corinthians because this was Corinthian propaganda

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.379
we have a description of her the monument that they set up once it was

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:52.920
declared right so let me step back Elian look in Alien for the one of the sources

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.019
that you'll be able to find this but um look what's going on you're in Corinth

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.840
and they've got a plague and they're like What's the what's the deal send the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.120
embassy out to the pythia right right always to the pythia this is the same

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.900
Priestess right this is the same group of oracles that dictate what goes on in

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.979
the world you and I wouldn't be sitting here knowing the name Socrates without them

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:28.919
talk about Empire gorgeous the oracles what are the oracles tell the Corinthians

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:35.400
hey you got a plague bozos because you falsely claimed that Medea killed her on

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.720
children when you know there was a mob of people once she burned the palace down who cornered her

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.840
kids they cornered her kids they beat them to death and then threw them into a

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:56.580
well and then to add impiety to their crime

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.240
they blame Medea for having killed her own children a smear of her personality

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.240
the smear it was um and uh the ancient source that we

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.639
have is talking about you know it's the we all know the monument they're talking about because once the embassy got back

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.400
with that with that message they built a monument there at the site where they

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.759
threw the bodies of her children said hey

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:33.060
mayor Cooper right many of you talk about Medea we're not talking about myth

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.960

into the Gospel of John I want to warn you this is dirty stuff dirty stuff let's just look at it you know this

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:55.380
Maria he says now what is this by the way one more time because I know we said it a few times I know people getting it

00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:04.260
this is the paraphrase of John's gospel by the incredible scholar known as fifth

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.360
century who's doing um who's who's working with

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:16.380
um the most cult bakic mystery over 48 books I mean this

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:21.899
guy's genius right this guy has all that's hidden has all that esoteric

00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:27.660
stuff that we need and he paraphrased he rewrites John he rewrites John and when

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:33.420
he does so he exposes Jesus for what's going on it's gonna get graphic it's

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:40.260
going to get really graphic but what's Happening Here Maria yeah Mary what's

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:48.540
going on this is the Mary which Mary are we talking about we're talking about the one who carries the goddess for Jesus

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:54.860
the one who carries the goddess for Jesus take a look at this Greek people

00:11:54.860 --> 00:12:00.540
right that's an alternative um uh

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.940
uh most of what you're about to see is Alternatives Greek students is because

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:11.700
uh he's got a fit meter right and these are typical

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:18.899
um things that notice does right this this work is got his fingerprints all over it right it's definitely you could

00:12:18.899 --> 00:12:24.120
not have tried to imitate him more closely um but he says what's happening this is

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:30.600
the Maria that is that one who Bears the Goddess that beautiful-haired one and

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:36.600
that is a title that we use in the mystery that we use in the mystery who

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:43.160
is she who Bears the goddess I bet you want to know this don't you

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:49.740
who is she who Bears the goddess it's a title cult title and Mary is given the

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:56.339
cult title just like we had the Cristos juanax yeah

00:12:56.339 --> 00:13:02.459
yeah now here we are um what is she doing for Jesus you're

00:13:02.459 --> 00:13:07.680
about to see her bring the goddess you're brought to see her bring the goddess and

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:14.519
um look at the next line what does she do she she oils up his feet she oils up

00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:22.800
both of his feet with the Dew with the what with the do

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:30.899
with the Dew I want you to keep that little word in mind for a second and I just want you to realize that

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:37.560
um we're getting into a technical language now fantastic with the Dew of what I'm

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:44.820
expecting drugs do I see drugs of course I do with with respect to the do

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:50.720
you know of the myrrh the muron

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:57.079
that we are using in the

00:13:57.079 --> 00:14:04.680
sacrifices that fumigate us to the seventh heaven

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:10.860
fantastic fantastic so

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:17.459
don't be mistaken don't be mistaken is there more I think there was more there in that one sorry

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:06.959
seminarians don't know this write your Bible scholars you people don't have access to this stuff I'm

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:14.060
giving it to you look at number two to wipe clean especially in Magic ceremonies

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:19.920
especially in Magic ceremonies look at the very last line of that of a serpent

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.820
of that paragraph of a serpent right to apomas

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:33.000

typical not only a priestess but a goddess or goddess and look you can see

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:25.500
it's in the orphic hymns but who is the Goddess that it talks about in the

she put Jesus's body fluid how are their body fluids involved at this point with

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.660
all of this drug terminology starting to get to me let's keep reading

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:56.160
those of you who aren't intellectual adults you're going to want to leave the room

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.559
you're going to want to leave the room because we're we're going to look at the text

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:09.600
we're going to look at the text from Antiquity that is going to explain it this is gorgeous I love it okay let's uh

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.240
put that one up again yeah oh and uh okay yeah so

um while all of this is going on um Maria's brother right her sungunos

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.760
right the person who's in the same Clan her brother it's another way of poetic

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:34.679
way of saying brother um and he is what kind of brother he's a barugunos he's um not too good on his

00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:40.740
feet he's not too good on his feet he's kind of weighed down he's got heavy knees

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:48.200
right he's got heavy knees and why does he got heavy knees

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:57.059
because he is himaseto he's struck it's the idea think about

00:19:57.059 --> 00:20:02.520
the person with the whip the person with the whip the mystics

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:08.220

you see it this is an alabastran I want you to notice it can both contain

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:03.899
fluid and be used as a medical applicator for which Aristophanes made

00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:12.059
fun of it yes it is an ancient dildo

00:33:12.059 --> 00:33:18.720
and that's precise terminology this history that we're doing

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:24.120
contains the dildos and the use of those dildos

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:30.960
yeah the marble now in Antiquity dildos were made of

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:38.279
several materials dildos were made of leather the actors on the stage employed large

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:48.620
leather dildos they were made of polished Stone

00:33:50.299 --> 00:33:57.659
the marble is particularly uh user friendly when it comes to the

00:33:57.659 --> 00:34:04.500
applications of drugs to the rectum in Antiquity this is history

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:11.940
about Jesus yeah remember the naked boy that was with

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:22.280
Jesus when he got arrested and I was keep putting this in the context that we can if he and Mary are

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:28.580
openly engaged in a mystery that involves drugs and sex

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:35.280

the Dew and um she did what she anointed

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:37.500

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:50.640
has to be consuming her he has to be consuming her yes and if you look up if

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:56.760
you look it up you'll see that it's used with respect to specific drugs

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:02.820
and what specific drugs are there oh well it's the EOS are you surprised

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:08.760
no you shouldn't be this is a circus where we can track the drugs perfectly

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:14.760
we always know what's going on if we're watching the drugs and what is she doing

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:22.380
she is producing this drug she's producing it she brings the Dew

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:28.980
she brings the Dew okay so bring it up again let's see let's see

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:35.160
that last okay and what happens well it's an orgy people so

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:42.660
um ultimately everybody's gonna get involved Ryan look at what she's doing now you know why Gregory pardoned her

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:50.820
right for using if this is the same the same one for using the sex drugs Gregory

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:57.660
was talking about it anyway so on the next line what does it says [Music]

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:03.300
yeah look at the next line 15 ikmada what is she doing

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:09.200
harvesting that ikmada spread wide

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:17.119
and what kind of ikma that is it it's

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:25.980
you know that some fluids can be clear like water

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:32.040
can behave like water some fluids from Antiquity we're talking like

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:38.520
the docks did an Antiquity and some some fluids can be sticky

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:44.520
they can stick together so as Galen says you could take your finger and you can

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:51.780
take the fluid and you can stretch your fingers in the fluid makes it a little string because

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:57.119
it's viscous yeah it's kind of thick kind of like Slim

00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:02.579
yes right right well we've got that here

00:40:02.579 --> 00:40:07.740
we've got that here in Mary's Hair

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:13.260

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:22.099
in the vapors they're being made drunk

00:46:22.099 --> 00:46:29.160
with the vapors and I just want to bring up that last Greek slide Chewie that we

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:36.300

what's Mary doing you can see her on the floor right and what is she doing spread over Jesus

00:46:44.359 --> 00:46:49.920
and what is she doing with her marble she is swimming

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:55.578

00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:21.540
stoned it intoxicated do you remember Medea intoxicating people against their

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:27.440
will with the fumigations that is exactly what is going on here

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:32.640
do we know what happened to the rest of the disciples that were with him who

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:37.980
became intoxicated we do not but I can tell you this for a

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:43.500
fact a Seder is a Seder and a Seder will just as soon

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:48.660

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:54.319

00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:22.920
and I'm afraid following Mary's pardon for the sex

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:29.099
drugs I'm afraid this went downhill

00:48:29.099 --> 00:48:36.119
yeah it went downhill now we're gonna watch that we're gonna

00:48:36.119 --> 00:48:43.680
track that because when we bring the case to court it's a trans-dimensional court and we've got Jesus and we've got

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:49.319
his naked boy from Mark 14 51 52. we have everything built up with his child

00:48:49.319 --> 00:48:54.900

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:08.819
the ikmas I want that on display when Jesus is sitting in the witness stand

00:49:08.819 --> 00:49:14.640
because you know he's he's gonna go ahead and try to take he's going to be dumb enough to think he can take the

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:20.060
witness down you know when we hold up that body fluid from

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:27.359
dude genetic test is genetic test right evidence is evidence is this your bodily

00:49:27.359 --> 00:49:35.640
fluids Jesus in the hair of Mary is this your is this your bodily fluid is this your

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:44.220
do you Jesus Christ sit there with Mary with a marble Alabaster that is built to

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:49.560
drug You by plugging your portals Jesus

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:54.900

that is covered on the medicated dildo

00:50:00.119 --> 00:50:06.240
