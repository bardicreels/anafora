get out of their cars nice production meaningless

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:57.720
what is that tuning it's the movement from alpha to Omega there are three words in that in that opening paragraph

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:03.440
that are directly pulled from Biblical mystery

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.600

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:21.900
is the one Paul doesn't want you to read this is the one where that dude comes

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:28.559
into town he's yelling at the pythia we're all like what and he said you got to take those magic

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:35.720
books and you gotta throw them out you got to throw them out and I gotta redo the baptism of John

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.440
and everybody's like that's a good idea book burning is always the way to start

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.700
no they didn't do that they didn't say that they just did it because they

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:53.940
didn't have enough brains to say what are we doing by destroying

00:21:53.940 --> 00:22:00.179
one thing we're supposed to generate another what kind of world is this that we live

00:22:00.179 --> 00:22:06.539
in no no shame on them all for throwing away their books thankfully somebody

00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:14.280
found the trash Heap and that's where we get the thing that the scholars call the mythrak liturgy

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:21.299
the mithric Liturgy fantastic you can find the vocabulary that Paul is using

00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:27.480
in the PGM in the papyri greca magikai you can find

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:34.380
the language Paul is using you can hone down so that when Jesus says I am the alpha in the Omega that it is not a

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:41.120
surprise it's not a surprise to you we are

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.440
practicing rights that have been established since the Bronze Age that's

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:51.480
why they have the drugs in their hair is why they have the trucks in their

00:22:51.480 --> 00:23:00.059

and you look into the performance of the mystery you're going to see

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.340
the mirror image of the vocalizations

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:02.640
the tutelage of a virgin goddess

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:08.640
yeah yeah fantastic if you have strayed from the

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.859
Virgin goddess and you have people walking around in bags

00:40:13.859 --> 00:40:20.820
who don't have the same ability to be educated don't have the same freedoms that you do if you don't have that

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:27.119
statue on the hill of the virgin anymore oh goodness how can you expect to Shield

democracy how can you expect you can't look at this right and what is doing to

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:41.880
the person who is going to be entering this place where they see everything functioning

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:56.400
yeah when you hear the unheard

00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:02.040
when you are there and able to chemically open up this space

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:08.400
when you are able to thanks to the Renaissance to be able to do so

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:13.619
um you enter that space that petrarch narrates in his secret

00:41:13.619 --> 00:41:20.940
yes the reason that petrarch could open a book at random and have a conversation with his beloved

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:29.480
right the entire secret is about their conversation yeah guiding you through no different

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:34.859

but ended up being her son how did she come out of it

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:08.099
she came out of it by looking up and when the sky cleared

00:43:08.099 --> 00:43:14.040
she came back to her senses and she saw what she had done

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:23.280
and she knew that Bacchus was just yeah why because she had called his

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:28.859
mother a liar she had called his mother a liar

00:43:28.859 --> 00:43:35.160

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:16.560
moves through the initiation yes

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:23.880

Victory right brings us freedom yes yes

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:57.920
when you change the paradigm when you take the mystery and you alter

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.359
the physics so as to reduce the version

00:45:03.359 --> 00:45:07.400
and to exalt

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:13.700
the jackass and I say that

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:22.440
straight up donkey the donkey who carries that right

00:45:53.040 --> 00:46:00.420
framework very comfortably this is the profanation of the mystery you will find

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:09.180
out that in the temple of Jerusalem in the temple of Jerusalem is the dote

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:16.640
and the antidote you will find that they were performing the rights to take them

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:25.859
into the Wilderness and you will find that Judaism Christianity are built upon

00:46:25.859 --> 00:46:35.220
practice that was created in the Bronze Age and that this practice will come to

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:44.520
