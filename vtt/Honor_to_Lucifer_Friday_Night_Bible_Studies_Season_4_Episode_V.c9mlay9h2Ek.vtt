00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:05.280
see did somebody as they open the door you didn't see who it hit right um we're gonna go to Docker Lane pagles

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.620
let's go to the the very first uh yep there you go

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:17.460
um look this is uh etymologic definition right we're trying to find out what is

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.340
who what is Satan what it's a proper name right of the Supreme evil spirit

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:30.060
I'll take that with a sour cream please and great adversary humanity and Christianity

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.460
okay right away um uh okay I thought it was just a Greek

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:42.180
word I'm just looking for that area Old English say well you guys are not going back far enough right late Latin Satan

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.400
right and Vulgate in the Old Testament only from Greek satanas

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:54.300
from Hebrew Satan adversary wait wait wait minute wait

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:02.940
what did we do we skip from Hebrew into Greek into Latin into English and

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:09.900
into what you and I are talking about right now how do we get on this pathway guys I'm sorry I didn't talk to the tour

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.479
guide this is a I'm gonna write this down because I don't like being here any more than you do

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:21.240
okay um from the Hebrew really give me that chord up again and maybe we can find out

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.840
who's behind this tour oh look it's Elaine pagels on the origin of Satan let me guess

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.940
there's book there's an article there's something something bring me back something that

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.460
involves the exchange of currency whether it's money

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:46.199
or whether it's fame or whether it's academic bragging rights

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:53.940
yes some kind of currency is being exchanged give us the lanes wisdom

00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:00.000
in biblical sources the Hebrew term the Satan describes an

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.180
adversarial role it is not the name of a particular character although Hebrew storytellers

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:14.580
as early as the 6th Century BCE occasionally introduces supernatural character whom they call Satan

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:21.960
okay now wait a minute um you're oh so Elaine you have sixth Century Hebrew sources

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:29.460
wait wait wait what's that wait where's can you feel this

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:34.680
Ryan can you feel that tell me your sources right

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.919
um I'd love to see them oh you don't have any wait what you mean everything

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:45.680
that you're gonna refer to is gonna be coming through the Septuagint and

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:52.140
alexandrian source an alexandrian source that is our oldest

00:08:52.140 --> 00:09:00.600
Source the the maserates yeah diverted the River from when they made

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:06.120
their version Oh over a thousand years later

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.279
so where the heck are we we need to stick to the science remember

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:19.320
I told you the cave is dark let's stick to the science let's just look at the name look at the name this name was

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.200
existing before long before there's any written Hebrew

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:31.800
um you're not you're really not getting anything from the Hebrew until the second Century A.D

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:38.940
right I mean by then it's over the classical era is over right so what

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:47.100
we're talking about is we're talking about the originals we want to go back we want to see who is Satan who is Satan

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.440

to kill you all now what's funny is they play it against each other right because the Christians

00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:21.500
you're like you know the Muslims and the Jews are getting it right right

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:29.220
Muslims are like other Christians and Jews are wrong they're getting it right he's gonna show up whoever he is I

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:36.900
guarantee you he's got testicles though he's gonna show up and there's gonna be blood up to the horse right we all know

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:44.220
that look I'm not gonna let me not waste any of your time let's go right back let's go right back to some texts should

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:50.160

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:56.700
there for you guys you know if you want to see that commission just so you know I'm not making it up they say if they

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:04.380
drink any deadly thing this is King James um but what King James translators didn't do was read ancient medicine and

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:10.440
if they had they would know that word there is used for a drug that induces a

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:18.600
death State it's a whole class of drugs you can induce a death State I can give you something and walk back in in 15

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:27.419
minutes and you will appear to be a corpse isn't that nice deaf inducing drugs

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:34.860
death inducing drugs some of them they use in surgery yeah makes sense doesn't it wake up you

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:40.380
know catch up come on man we're way behind our people are way behind on this one

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.659
right Watchers are like I don't know you may be able to make it but you know it's closing quick get those people over

00:21:45.659 --> 00:21:53.039
there right oh God reason reason we got to push the reason okay so here we are here we are with

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:58.380
Celsius now I want to get us our next text yeah

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.659
um Satan we're looking at Satan there was a day when sons of God came to present themselves everybody everybody

00:22:03.659 --> 00:22:10.200
knows what this is It's job one six they came to present themselves before Lord and Satan also came among them take it

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:15.380
down that's not there you say

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:22.260
oh it is in the version that was made in the 10th Century it is there

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:27.360
but in the original that everybody's quoting it's not there

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.640
is Satan's not there nope not there

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.980
Okay so um let's keep looking for Satan then

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:43.039
okay his um here's where you see you want to see Satan I give you Satan

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:50.520
people say the only place we have this is the Septuagint right the Old Testament I am a Bible

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:58.260
scholar right yes um watch what happens to the name just

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:04.860
let's do some philology shall we um here's a Septuagint this is I think

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:10.799
it's First Kings 11 and this is verse 14 that I'm looking at and I just want you

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:15.779
to see in verse 14 Kai again Satan

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:24.720
yeah and the Lord curios you can take it down the Lord which is curious which the

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:30.780
10th Century translators who were back translating this Greek

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:36.299
turned into Yahweh

00:23:36.299 --> 00:23:43.620
wait you telling me Yahweh is a linguistic invention I'm telling you

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:50.700
hang on let me get it Yahweh is just another way of saying

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:56.940
yeehaw it's an invention

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:04.860
they're using the word curios which is a very very old pre-hebrew Greek term

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.960
it goes back 800 years before the very

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.179
first scratches of Hebrew show up

00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:21.840
so when you tell me Satan is from a Hebrew word that's over 800 years after

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:28.860
the fact I'm gonna tell you you've been reading that Bible that is based on a translation that is over a thousand

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:36.600
years after the fact good job could you not do one thing right

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:43.799
linguistics is that right get it right so where is Satan coming from we bring

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:50.220
up Satan and all his minions here um we don't need that one here I want you to give me uh I want you to give me

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:56.220
this one now okay yeah here we've got so you ask yourself is this

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:02.700
Satan is a Greek translation of something surely its root

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:11.720
can't be found anywhere else oh no oh no look at this list

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:26.299
that's a good one that's my personal favorite I'm gonna show you what that's a drug

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:34.980
that's an antidote see the one on the top this is an antidote

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:40.740
okay um and let's come back to this but I want to show you I want to just take a

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:48.059
break and I want to tell you all my students let's get that get that down all of my

00:25:48.059 --> 00:25:53.220
students you know in unit seven of the Intensive Greek course you find in the

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:59.340
notes on the book yeah vocabulary the vocabulary notes you

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:07.919
find a little section on rhetor right on their word for rhetorician right speaker

00:26:07.919 --> 00:26:14.880
what does he tell us that word speaker is cognate with the English word

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:21.299
and you say really the word are from the same

00:26:21.299 --> 00:26:27.840
word they develop from the same similar the the very same root yes they did and

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:34.200
you say wait a minute where's the W come from in word it's a Dye gamma

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:41.340
Thai camera oh my goodness it's a dive gamma and it's hiding in the row

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:46.740
you hear there's a there's an aspiration the beginning of the word

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:52.799
it really is wur that's really how you say it but by the

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:58.200
time we get it not a Greek it's represented by just an aspirate right an

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:04.980
aspiration rough breathing so what does all that mean

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:11.179
I want to show you a little bit of grammar I know you people love this because you're like you're very nerdy

00:27:11.179 --> 00:27:17.100
and like sexy nerdy you know what I mean so I like that I like that

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:22.679
um can you bring up this one this is from a Greek grammar this is from a Greek grammar and I just want you

00:27:22.679 --> 00:27:30.179
to notice blow that up big Joy um I just want you to notice under section 129 under dissimulation that's

00:27:30.179 --> 00:27:36.720
how right right don't get too like don't get too wound up right show you show us some

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:45.120
self-control here because we're going in right we're going in deep look at look at the a consonant usually rho

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:52.039
usually sometimes disappears okay just stop there take it down

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:59.220
you mean you can have a consonant which is almost always row

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:05.520
disappear yes you can so saturnus

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:11.220
and satanus are the same word yes they are

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:18.600
and we even have proof these words are linked because the dye

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:24.900
gamma stays on the Roman side you see the diagram in the U

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:31.220
saturnus yes isn't that nice

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:41.059
in its oldest form became saturnus right became satanas

00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:51.539
and that is the origin of Satan that has not been proposed you will not

00:28:51.539 --> 00:29:00.240
find that in any peer-reviewed Journal article perhaps in 10 years

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:06.779
they might get wise and throw it together yeah that's what happened with the chemical

00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:12.120
Muse Professor from Brown told me it's going

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:18.299
to take him 10 years to catch up with you I was like I don't have the time bro

00:29:18.299 --> 00:29:23.640
yeah I'm going ahead so I got a good head start here

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:28.640
and I'm bringing to you the Revelation tonight

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:35.820
that Judaism and Christianity are mystery religions

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:41.279
that were originally based in the worship of Satan

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:47.340
thank you yeah yeah fantastic

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:54.600
fantastic now what about this name what does it mean we're only halfway there right I mean

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:00.679
um we're more than halfway there but we're only halfway there on the name okay I see how it's Greek older

00:30:00.679 --> 00:30:06.720
Mycenaean predating the Hebrew by nearly a thousand years

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:13.020
love it now you know why the Greeks have the name Adam and it doesn't surprise you

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:20.460
and it doesn't mean what you've been told it means because you have been lied to for a thousand years

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:28.260
a thousand years one splinter in the museum boom everything's corrupt

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:34.679
wow it's like you know people ask me what about magic what about magic what about

00:30:34.679 --> 00:30:41.399
this if you want real magic go back to the source right yeah what do you mean go back to the

00:30:41.399 --> 00:30:49.820
source well as We Know we Sons and Daughters of Venus know

00:30:49.820 --> 00:31:00.360
these languages came to us through the hands of the witches

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:08.760
yeah isn't that neat and then you say wait a minute wait a minute I'm starting to smell Rome

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:15.440
in lady Babylon I'm starting to smell Rome in lady Babylon does anybody else

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:20.880
smell rum for those of you who've been so patient

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:27.840
while I've beaten Paul the apostles ghost I want to say thank you and for those of

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:33.840
you who've asked I'll give him one more I'll find one more example to give him to give him a good one but I don't know

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:39.960
why people like why people like that one so much is it I don't know it kind of feels good it's cathartic

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:46.460
you know yeah yeah my drugs

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:52.340
if you could be that Roman soldier would you

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:58.260
right right excellent okay let's keep going um I want to go back to the text let's

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:06.600
uh so we have our word here um I just want you to see this one satoros so here it is with the row and

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:12.919
bring it down to the definition and Alice and I just want you to guys to see here this is

00:32:12.919 --> 00:32:19.919
a lewd goddess fellow what I'd lewd godish fellow I don't use the

00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:24.960
word lewd anymore at least nobody's been lewd as anybody's

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:30.840
Jewish anybody been lewd to you no I don't think anybody's ever been lured to me at least lately

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:37.919
right so um what is a lewd go back to that definition watch these people never

00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:45.779
abandon the science don't don't believe me because I'm wearing something on my head maybe I've got a beard maybe I've

00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:52.080
got some staff of magic power you know maybe I've got I'm bald you know with a

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:59.880
bunch of other bald guys who wearing the same color I don't know fuchsia I don't know is that a color maybe we're all

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:06.840
wearing that don't believe me for those reasons go down to the science right we're not here because we're gullible

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:15.919
look at number four on saturos is do you know what entasis is

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:26.519
tension a stretching a straining a force of compulsion

00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:35.600
it is what is in Zeus's that cause him to become erect

00:33:36.299 --> 00:33:43.159
okay I think I'm getting it it makes sense why satorian

00:33:43.159 --> 00:33:50.100
that is used by those who follow saturnas or satanas

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:58.260
that turian is used to get me into the state where I am tense with respect to

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:04.260
Aphrodite and sure enough we have ancient depictions of this

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:09.960
right we have ancient depictions of this apparently it's quite it's quite a it's

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:15.540
quite the deal but in order to be a Seder now you're going to recognize the seders

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:23.460
in order to be a Seder you have to have you have to have that Son of God power

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:28.520
you have to yeah it doesn't matter if your

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:35.339
initiation involves a boy or a girl you still have to have that power

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:42.020
that is the sign that you are following in the Kingdom of Satan

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:48.540
you're on that throne a few months ago everybody here we all

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:54.419
had the privilege of looking at a recipe parts of a recipe by a physician of

00:34:54.419 --> 00:34:59.780
neroes and it was a net it was a recipe for atheriac one of these religious

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:08.280
antidotes compound antidotes that they're using and cult right in Ritu in right and we

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:14.160
had the privilege of seeing that a part of something called the orphic Vox

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.579
is which is this language it's a coded language written on the back of a text

00:35:19.579 --> 00:35:25.859
using words like mini throne to represent many drugged

00:35:25.859 --> 00:35:32.579
we saw that many throned was used for the steriac it was a way of

00:35:32.579 --> 00:35:40.500
referring to the communion substance it is also a way of referring if the

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:45.180
title is used again Cersei

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:53.700
who yeah who enters into Union

00:35:53.700 --> 00:36:00.359
with crony and Zeus yeah of the waters the Waters of

00:36:00.359 --> 00:36:07.020
creation yeah you like that you thought that Waters of creation you thought that was

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.920
yeah

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:21.300
Alaskan for any Egyptian anything appeared pulaskians were doing

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:27.540
it we get the rich are coming through them people and Prometheus was an idiot

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:34.200
wait what that's what they thought yeah he was the bad example yeah welcome to

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:40.980
your own stupidity it said know yourself on the door when you came in

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:46.920
oh my goodness don't you love it don't you love it we can route we can just

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:54.960
roll in this stuff I love it I love it okay I want to see if we have any more uh on the text the last text there right

00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:02.400
there give me that one here here we have um citarian right the plant that excited

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:08.880
lust yeah there you go or a drink prepared from it

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:16.020
right because that's what they'll do they'll call the drink the same thing as the plant right give me some Hemlock did

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:24.420
you know they drank hemlock for recreation yeah puts you into a psychotic State

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:29.960
before it kills you isn't that nice

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:38.940
so these death-bringing drugs are pretty important it's a whole class it's a whole class of drugs and when

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:44.060
Jesus says that his people should be entering into this right

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:51.839
whereby they are able to be immune to serpents and to drink

00:37:51.839 --> 00:38:00.540
Death Bringers and not die why people scientifically why how can

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:07.560
this possibly be unless people like Paul are immune to these venoms

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:12.780
have built up an immunity to these Venoms and again don't think right this

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:18.780
is all being administered in sex rights so this isn't you know your person

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:24.780
taking a little Venom every once in a while exposing themselves to it this is a right where you're gonna have the

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:29.940
stuff um boosted up your backside right you're

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:35.760
gonna get a sudden big bolus of it right this is fraternity

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:41.280
right type ecstasy yeah so fantastic

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:48.140
fantastic okay I want to just end with um if I can get one more time this list

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:53.760
I just want people to notice that on this list we have the goat

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:59.339
and we have saturnus do you know what saturnus does he gives

00:38:59.339 --> 00:39:05.099
you the ability to enter into that sexual

00:39:05.099 --> 00:39:11.880
right he gives you that ability so that when you are sitting imagine that woman

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:18.900
sitting she was sitting there thinking there are little boys and there are little girls

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:25.380
in their rooms with pimply faces and where does she go you can tie their
