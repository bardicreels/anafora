view that we haven't had before and I'm going to bring these texts out to you and cause you to slip into the state of

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.920
reality I love this stuff I love this stuff don't listen don't listen to them

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.920
right that's what I told them don't listen to them but they always

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.719
do wax you got to either tie yourself down you got to put wax in your ears

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.560
right it's one of the two tonight what I'd like to bring you as usual we look

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.200
at a couple of Hebrew texts that took the Greek original and just slammed it

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.879
into the ground just cut off every

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:26.200
pedal all the buds sipped them off all you got a all you got is a stem left and

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.200
it's got thorns on it um tonight we're going to look at a couple more of those

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.760
examples because what we're doing and I I kind of want to give the congregation the big picture tonight what has

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.159
wrinkled people is the revelation of

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.519
what a Christ is and the revelation of the naked boy

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.280
with Jesus and the Revelation that Moses and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.599
Yahoo were born in the 3r century those are the three things that really

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:10.480
are getting to people so I am doing the best job that I can to show you and to

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.159
be honest it's easy it's easy not just because it's the

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:24.440
Muse but because the translation into Hebrew from the creek is taking a step

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.040
from 1.7 million 1.5 million

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.760
down to 7,000 unique words and that's not a that's not a step down that's a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.120
plummet Scholars Scholars can look at the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.959
texts you can look at the text it's the evidence that we have right and the

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:58.239
evidence shows us that we are living a lie and I am here to free you I'm here

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:06.640
to free you from that Li to the reality which is not always so

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.200
bright it's difficult to tell

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.479
Muslims Jews Christians did you know that your

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:26.000

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:52.759
the other thing we're doing and I just want to remind you this so everybody here at satanic congregation

great leaders intellectual leaders thinkers yeah I don't know if you could

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.160
call them that um but it turns out that these people are unwilling to

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.520
engage because they are out of their depth and they know it very wisely they

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.280

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.199
the Muse we honor those texts and that evidence we use the reason that we've

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:04.039

injunction not to harm my Christ's

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:08.280
who am I I'm Yahoo I'm Yahoo and you cannot touch my

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:17.600
Christ yeah you can't do anything bad to my people who are in prophetic

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:25.080
trance wait a minute what that is from the Psalms the Psalms

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:30.400
kitties Psalm is a great Greek

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:37.840
word did you think it was Hebrew music isn't that funny it's not look at the courses they even talk

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:44.280
about the courses the instruments they're using and everything it's all Greek there is no

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:50.480
Hebrew oh my god let's see let's see what happens in Translation then because

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:58.280
this is going to be funny right we have to if we are thir Century um if we are third Century

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:06.080
people people trying to uh create a world to

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.440
describe religious experience and we're creating these

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:19.400
characters like Moses and whatnot it only makes sense that they have very bakic attributes right that they have

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.480
the attributes of the culture around them during the time which this is being

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:31.840
written right you can't let Fashions modern fashion slip into your historical

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:37.960
fiction right did anybody see in the last episode the bug on the

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:43.760
thumbnail right the guy in the corner the prophet had a

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:51.559
watch right the fact is you're being given that which is

00:21:51.559 --> 00:22:01.480
fake you're being sold that which is fake it's fake history it's fake history

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:08.480
and how do we know the real history from the text man look at the text bring that Psalm up again what is that Psalms say

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:14.240
bring up the Greek perfect yeah it's talking about protecting my Christ and

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:21.000
my prophets huh that's weird now for you Evangelical Christians out there I

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.400
thought there was only one Christ apparently there's not apparently there were christs in ureides polius

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:36.000
when the really really horny fedra came up and said look I got to

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000
have this young guy I gotta have this young guy right it's just it's got to happen do you have any drugs and her

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.520
nurse was like which one do you want I got a Christ and I got a pable Christ or

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:56.720
pable which one you want to rub it into your eyes fedra you want to rub it into your eyes in other

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:02.480
places right do you want to drink it do you want to put it in your they also put

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:07.640
it in their rectum there's another way of Drug Administration right the point is

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:16.320
they're on drugs let's watch them on drugs I'm gonna show you right now Paul literally dripping in

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:23.480
drugs do you know what they drank in Antiquity I'm going to tell you now and then I'm going to show you you dirty

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:29.600
dirty dirty people you know what they drank in antiquity

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.039
they drank Paul's testicular

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:42.919
sweat Paul's testicular sweat no wonder that dude got mad and flipped out that

00:23:42.919 --> 00:23:49.120
dude flipped out during the right chewy they were having the riot with Paul and the dude flipped out and he was like no

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:56.240
no no no this is not how it's going to work right no it was seven other dudes he already did it with Paul oh and it

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:01.760
was seven let's bring him up let's bring him up this you guys are going to love this are you ready people didn't know

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:08.720
that Paul was involved Paul's the biggest junkie on the planet is that the one we just did yeah yeah yeah that's it

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:15.520
go to the next one there's just just for people to see some English you know translations of it right is it your

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:21.799
anointed ones is it is it your chosen people you know what I mean what is it

00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:29.320
what is it it's not any of that right um because it's in the Greek because that is going to be a translation of the down

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:34.880
translation that is the Hebrew okay the English is going to be a

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:41.360
translation of that Hebrew not of the Greek original give me that that's why it's so important for us to get to get

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:48.640
it yeah so the kings of the Earth this is end of the psalm got together the

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:56.600
rulers they got together to fight against this cuos and against his

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.360
Christos and against his

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.840
Christos you mean this drug guy is all

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:13.120
over the the uh Old Testament the Jewish

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:19.480
scriptures soall you mean this dude is all yeah and there's a whole bunch of

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:27.880
them because you see that's the whole part of getting high and seeing visions that is prophetic

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:34.960
it's the whole time people ask me people ask me Dr Hillman why why is

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.039
this um the information you're bringing is compelling but why is it that nobody

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:46.919
else has seen this before I'll tell you why I'll tell you why you lazy

00:25:46.919 --> 00:25:52.720
bastards it's because nobody was reading any of these documents nobody was

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:59.600
reading the medical side yeah yeah and I'm just fortunate to have

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:05.480
stumbled on to it you know what I mean and that that's metal finding that for

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:13.399
me has been metal it's been better than better than getting blacklisted better than getting kicked out of a

00:26:13.399 --> 00:26:20.960
university better than being involved in legal this and legal that in order to

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:27.000
restore those rights of free speech

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:33.799
it turns out you can teach the Bible but you have to teach it like they want you

00:26:33.799 --> 00:26:40.720
to teach it which is funny because here is our conundrum again why doesn't

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:46.159
Jordan Peterson debate me why doesn't he talk

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:53.880
to me about Jesus he doesn't we don't have to debate I hate debate we can just talk about Jesus we

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:59.640
can talk about Christ we can talk about ancient Greek

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:05.720
we can talk about the Old Testament being a document given to us

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:11.399
by the Tongue ancient Greek yes it's too bad don't worry it wasn't just Hebrew

00:27:11.399 --> 00:27:17.440
they stomped they also stomped all this Aramaic people like yeah

00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:25.760
Aramaic yeah Aramaic was the fly that was going around oh God I can't get it mother GRE

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:32.880
was stomping everybody everybody she even put Latin the Imperial language she

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:39.279
even put Latin in her place can you believe that God those people were

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:46.480
powerful too when you and what's the proof you say what's the proof F you want the proof go to the library that

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:52.039
they just opened up in herculanum and scan those scan those Papyrus rolls

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:58.679
those Scrolls go look at those yeah yeah

00:27:58.679 --> 00:28:06.519
you're going to be surprised you're going to be surprised it's Greek overwhelming majority is Greek why

00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:13.519
in Rome right or in Pompei herculanum really yeah

00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:21.039
really right what language books do you purchase in Antiquity you

00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:28.559
purchase Greek books you purchase Greek books nobody buys Latin books right Oh

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:33.600
They'll have a few in the library overwhelming majority will be Greek why

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:40.000
because Greek did that to everyone when you can

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.360
express a concept like erotic

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:54.840
Mania that leads to Vision when you can put that into a

00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:00.480
word um your language is a monster your language will devour everybody

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:06.960
that's an Amazonian woman that's who it is where is she where is she did you have an

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:13.720
Amazonian let's get back to the evidence go ahead get back to the evidence people they're like look give me something

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:19.600
impressive okay you want to see something impressive yeah yeah

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:26.039
ex you see the Salvation again right right you came for the

00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:32.240
Salvation La of the people of your people

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:39.039
right and to save your Christ right and everybody says on the

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:46.039
Christian side says we this is one of the Minor Prophets talking about the Christ look it's a reference to the

00:29:46.039 --> 00:29:52.080
Christ like there was only one in the ancient world because you

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:58.200
listen to that fairy tale garbage too much and I'm not talking about the Bible you need to read the Bible you're

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.320
listening to the Theology and The Narrative of

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:10.840
control yeah it's exactly what it is you're listening to that not what the text is say give me that text back give

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:15.919
me that text back yeah so it's come for the Salvation of the PE of your people

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:21.080
and for the saving of your Christ now watch this

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:26.240
watch what the Hebrew does with this this is habach

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:32.919
3:13 right you went forth okay for what for the

00:30:32.919 --> 00:30:39.519
Salvation right which is Lea okay Tove is that Tove or no to I

00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:44.799
don't think it's Tove anymore um and for where's the other salvation the

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:53.960
salvation of your people and the salvation of your what it's salvation again do you

00:30:53.960 --> 00:31:00.080
see something strange the same word is repeated twice salvation

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:07.320
Salvation why why would you have to use the same word twice now if this is the original

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:13.159
which they want you to believe and which all of your English translators are stupid enough to

00:31:13.159 --> 00:31:21.760
believe um you're gonna have a Greek translation that's going to put the same word twice why is it the Greek version

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:28.360
doesn't use the same word twice I'll tell you why because Greek

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:37.159
after reading it for 35 years Greek is elegant Greek is elegant and Greek wants

00:31:37.159 --> 00:31:44.279
to present you with a root concept and then show off how it can flexibly bend

00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:50.840
it around and it does that in the Greek it's very natural to the Greek it uses a

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:56.600
form of the noun and the verb from which this one concept is derived they do it

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:02.440
all the time I've got another text of it coming up so for the Hebrew to have to

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:07.480
just say twice salvation um they're trying to

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:15.200
compensate because of course they're not their language cannot do cannot take be that flexible artistically they only

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:22.080
have 7,000 words bro there's nothing you can do with 7,000 words okay it's I'm

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:27.480
sorry I'm sorry you can't throw 7,000 words into a blender and have it end up

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:33.799
with a Banana Split it's not going to happen you can't do it give me the next one

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:39.880
that was a terrible example I must be hungry get uh give me the next one boom

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:46.000
okay um here's an example of exactly what I was just talking about

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:53.960
right right now you don't have to have Greek to understand look at the first

00:32:53.960 --> 00:33:01.360
word and you'll see Kos does every see Kos starting from the beginning good and

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:09.120
the ne next word what do you get there you get if you don't start with the Epsilon on the front you start with a Campa you get Kos again and then

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.639
something added on the end right on on the end of it what are they doing here

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:21.240
they are shifting between the main verb and a

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:29.799
participle that is going to be circumstantial in other words they're setting a stage for for you now every

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:37.080
time they do this the Hebrew misses it it misses it completely and you're going

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:46.120
to end up with something that is is uh nonsensical right they surrounded me yes

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:52.720
right where's the yes come from by the way because the Greek doesn't get there that's no there's no not even a hint of

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:59.880
that in the Greek where does it come from yeah let me let me just make sure let me just make sure that is there him

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:07.840
NOP no there isn't no not at all so they just use the same verb twice why because

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:15.599
of the pity of Hebrew words now I know it's typical for world renowned Hebrew

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:24.560
Scholars like Captain Kip I know it's popular for them to not know things like

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.679
Hebrew has vows by the way Kip um look at the vows they represent them as

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:34.919
points right look at the vows right so he was trying to I'm sorry but he was

00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:40.919
trying to professionally answer um why it is that um Greek has such an

00:34:40.919 --> 00:34:47.320
advantage why it's so much more expressive and has such a verbal capacity that's so far beyond ancient

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:53.358
Hebrew and um he said it's because ancient Hebrew doesn't have

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:58.720
fouls okay people people okay verify ly

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:07.960
ridiculous things told to you by experts right let them criticize the

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:14.599
kitchen but they they are not artists I would not I wouldn't once

00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:20.079
somebody tell me something like that I wouldn't listen I wouldn't listen to another word that they said about

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:25.960
anything historically Hebrew especially and that's how I recognized it was when

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:32.839
he stepped up and started talking about Greek and you can tell when somebody has been in the field you can tell and what

00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:39.599
their strength is and again people it's just the reason that Classics has traditionally left the Bible alone for

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:45.800
the theologians do you think if the Bible was

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:53.400
studied by scientists that you would have same output now of course you wouldn't of course you wouldn't right um

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:58.800
this is our chance right classicists have those tools it's just linguistic

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:04.960
tools that's all evidence that's all baby give me the next one give me the next one and what's going to happen look

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:10.960
at this this is another verse it's another Psalm and um the psalmist

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:16.440
says teach me the things that are most

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:22.920
useful both pidea and nosis pidea

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:28.200
enosis okay do you hear this this is right out of the thir Century there's no

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:33.240
way that this is not from the third or second even late second century give me

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:39.280
the next one how what did the Hebrew do it the Hebrew says good judgment to like

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:45.839
that like that to right up front B to right good judgment and what knowledge

00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:52.280
well what kind of what kind of knowledge is that it's kind of you know again you're asking a third grader after

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:59.160
explaining to him something from the University you want able to strain through um to know

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:04.960
knowledge okay knowledge it's a little bit General skill

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:11.000
truth yeah a little bit it's a little bit General let's see what the Greek

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.680
does let's see what the Greek actually does I want you to notice that when they say pidea you're talking about something

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:23.319
that is hugely Central to the ancient world hugely Central that it's the

00:37:23.319 --> 00:37:31.280
result of Greek language and it is that educ ation it is the education of a

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:37.640
child right education of a child look look at the anything taught or learned

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:43.480
an art or a science isn't that nice learning

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.880
education this isn't just knowledge do you hear how knowledge is the refined

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:55.280
kind of you know just generalized all have a hamburger you know what I mean

00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:01.119
right it's not you know we don't know all the ingredients we don't know did you get bacon with it you get extra

00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:08.560
cheese there buddy what's going on right um so but remember if you were to whisper these verses from the Greek into

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:14.040
the ear of a third grader this is the exact equivalent that you get out the

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:19.200
Hebrew translation it's a good thing they have Scholars who don't know that

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:27.040
Hebrew even has H has uh vowels are you serious are you serious their Scholars

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:33.280
don't even know that Hebrews ancient Hebrews restricted to a 7,000 78,000

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:40.040
word vocabulary right they reported 10 times that their their greatest Minds who read

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:47.200
all the books and do everything that they can do do you understand why they won't come and talk to me because it's a

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:54.160
circus it's a circus it's a show and it's disingenuine what I'm giving you

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:59.240
here is my kitchen and my crappy internet interet that's what I'm giving

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:04.520
you and I'm giving you the texts I'm showing them to you it's a

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:09.960
whole new world out there give it to me Chewy give the next one um I wanted you

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:15.000
to see what the nosis is too right just so you can kind of reach in yourself

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.680
into your soul um Gnostic informant will love this look at I like definition

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:25.760
number three recognizing right it's from ginoso right

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:33.760
or gnos and it's really it really is that acquiring of knowledge notice in

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:39.000
the very first definition they give you it has to do with inquiry right

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.880
investigation nosis is investigation nosis is investigation now

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:51.160
you see how complex that is and you have to start with good you know basic terms

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:59.400
in the Hebrew to kind of filter that down into something you that you know is manageable okay okay okay um but it's

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:06.000
clear people all of this is clear evidence clear evidence that Greek is

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.880
the primary language I'm going to show you let me show you a little term that they use little colloquial expression

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:18.920
they use in Greek um yeah he makes his

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:25.880
angels Spirits right and those who exercise his

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:32.640
rights he makes makes that poor flag on do you guys remember the

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:38.319
flux right flocks do you remember what that was give me the next one give me

00:40:38.319 --> 00:40:46.319
the next one um what is um by the way what did the Hebrew do with that they use the word fire okay and then another

00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:53.440
word give me the next one another word here's the regular word for fire that's fine because Po in the Greek is it's the

00:40:53.440 --> 00:41:01.000
same thing that's okay give me the next one right like you can imagine a third grayer fire daddy right okay good and

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.760
what is the verb that they use lot to Flame or to blaze so the flaming fire

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:16.200
the flaming fire only there's one problem um that's not the Greek term

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:21.680
that says when you put these two things together watch this um look at the

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:28.040
here's the flocks right flame fire is an element right and similar in metaphor

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:33.599
light radiating from jesus' hand like he's doing something he's putting some kind of energy in him or something I

prophesying okay and that's exactly what they're doing look that's exactly what

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:49.359

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:18.480
here are the text and what they're saying let's get let's continue on so and what kind of men are these they

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:24.040
happen to be 12 [Music] dudes and now you got to ask yourself

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:29.680
you got to say wait a minute Jesus is with 12 12 teenage kids one of whom is

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:35.319
sitting on his lap they never show that dude in the Last Supper they all look like they're 40 how about the one

00:48:35.319 --> 00:48:40.559
sitting on his lap that comes up to his mid chest

00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:46.640
right he's sitting there with his 12 why do you think these Magi are always

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:52.920
getting the 12 apostles why do you think they're always

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.318
doing that

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:05.640
boom God was creating a great work through the hands of

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:13.839
Paul okay Paul's hands are causing these people to enter

00:49:13.839 --> 00:49:19.280
into ecstasy to be able to communicate with

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:26.440
the Angulo okay I see him I see him right they see

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:33.000
him when when they see him Peter saw him he there's two dudes there with him right out of they're all both dead

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.040
too ghosts right there right and what does he what does he do God works with

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:44.160
the hands of Paul but wait here watch it happen watch it happens what

00:49:44.359 --> 00:49:52.000
happens he put his hands right on him but he also gave him his

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:59.200
sudaria his sudaria what is that it's a napkin or a handkerchief some kind of

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:05.839
cloth that you wipe your face with in your armpits when you're sweaty when

00:50:05.839 --> 00:50:13.079
you're out in the sun you wipe that stuff off Paul gave them that the people

00:50:13.079 --> 00:50:22.079
who were sick and he gave them his SE oh my God what it sounds bad what is

00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:31.000
that it's a girdle and if you don't understand what I mean by girdle if you are out walking

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:37.040
around and you take off all your clothes and you dance around it's going to become

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:44.520
apparent that you need girdling girdling you mean that was the

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:52.480
wrap of his testicles and penis and he was giving that to people

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:57.599
to lick are you kidding me yeah but but

00:50:57.599 --> 00:51:02.720
there's more there's more watch this Jesus does the same thing I'm about to show you you're going to you're going to

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:08.079
be shocked give it to me give it to me look he's back right so here's

00:51:08.079 --> 00:51:13.240
Jesus and there's a dude who's been in a

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:22.040
tomb there's a dude in a tomb once again and this dude is bound by his hands and

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:29.119
his feet I mean there's some funny stuff going on here right dude laying in a tomb and he gets up and he walks out

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:34.880
right he walks out but when he walks out of the Tomb and everybody's like oh man

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:41.680
what has he got he's got a sudario covering his

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:49.280
eyes covering his eyes why why are you going to have this what are they doing

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:54.440
because wiping that skin it's the same reason that Jesus made that old woman

00:51:54.440 --> 00:52:01.920
high from just touching him right just touching his clothing right the Magus is

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:07.720
a drug user extraordinaire Paul is so good at drugs

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:13.599
he's immune to Viper Venom right and Jesus is telling them all oh all these

00:52:13.599 --> 00:52:18.640
poisons don't worry they aren't going to hurt you right he's a drug man what does

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:24.799
the guy get up out of the Tomb and come to do from the Bible he's got that covering over his face the same thing

00:52:24.799 --> 00:52:31.200
Paul is giving people as Paul is laying on

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:38.480
hands yeah do you know what the Cure is for your demon do you know what the Cure

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:43.520
is yeah it's in Paul's nut

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:50.280
sweat in Paul's nut sweat yeah I don't know I don't know it is the Apostle Paul

00:52:50.280 --> 00:53:00.400
after all right right I don't know maybe maybe you know if was like collected

00:53:02.359 --> 00:53:08.720
earlier I think my faith would only take me so far with Paul's testicular sweat

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:17.920
but remember people so when Paul is with his his people is 12 when he's with them

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:24.680
and they're passing around the the taint juice you know whatever

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:30.119
that is the the by the way Crusaders I say that with all seriousness the

00:53:30.119 --> 00:53:37.000
Crusaders um had initiates lick new newbies had them lick that Tain because

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:45.119
that's where the purple cross was in their gings okay so this is a very practical

00:53:45.119 --> 00:53:54.440
thing that I'm talking about I'm just talking about drug transmission that's all right remember Christos is

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:59.880
drugged it's what it means right good fantastic and not just with

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:06.680
any drug but with ones that cause you to go nuts give me the next one we're going to go nuts here at these last sources

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:13.240
are you ready um okay now who else is doing it you think okay right like every

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:19.280
Jew in the room who's religious Jew right not secular Jew right but a

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:24.880
religious Jew monest Jew every monest Jew is going to say aha look at the

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:30.200
pagans and the dirty stuff they're doing now you be quiet because we've got your

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:35.839
magic writings that talk about homosexual love affairs

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:43.839
specifically between men and how Jehovah sponsors that what did it and

00:54:43.839 --> 00:54:51.160
here what it what's going on here look this what do you think the seven sons of the high priest skwa this his name what

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:56.920
do you think the seven sons of that high priest he's the Jewish high priest right

00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:05.000
see the word yudu what do you think they're doing remember her fingers are purple

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.680
Mary's fingers are purple what do you think they're doing they're doing the same thing with

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:18.920
the drugs and they try it with a dude and he gets mad and this is what he says to him watch this it's like a it's a

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:26.280
terrible um it's it's like a sad incident he um he says look um oh it's

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:32.319
it's coming through by the way the Bible author whoever wrote this is probably Luke but whoever wrote this the author

00:55:32.319 --> 00:55:40.280
who put this here says you know um this guy happened to have a PMA

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:46.559
Pon a spirit that was harmful okay so if you

00:55:46.559 --> 00:55:53.480
don't understand that within the cult you know all the casting out of demons right you can meet someone and you can

00:55:53.480 --> 00:56:00.599
figure out what their demons are and what the write drugs you can cast them out may require some some christing and

00:56:00.599 --> 00:56:09.160
it may require um sexual Congress of some sort or another um and what happens

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:14.240
uh this dude has a evil spirit he says he's got this evil spirit and what does

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:22.280
the evil spirit say it says I know right I'm aware of Jesus

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:29.720
right I'm aware of what Jesus you know what his act was right and I have

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:38.359
personal experience I have an understanding of Paul right I know it is but you

00:56:38.359 --> 00:56:46.000
seven this is something else like we don't know what happened they went into a house and you and I are going to NOW

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.599
Watch What Happens from the outside of the house but these seven sons of the high priest take this one dude into a

00:56:52.599 --> 00:57:00.119
house and he says look I know how Jesus does this and I've seen how Paul does this you guys are not doing it the same

00:57:00.119 --> 00:57:06.640
way and what happens you and I sitting inside the house we hear a commotion

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:11.760
from the inside as the dude jumps on him and it uses the same

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:18.640
word for jumping there that a predatory snake uses for for grabbing and holding

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:24.319
on with its fangs so what does he do this dude jumps on them both right with

00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:30.720
his bad spirit and he overpowers them right he overpowers them and you and I

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:36.720
sitting outside and watching watch them all run out and they are

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:45.720
naked do you know why they are naked because you end up naked when you have your eyes opened yeah it's the

00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:54.599
mystery yeah and and uh they're running out of his house and it says they're also beaten up he beat them he beat them

00:57:54.599 --> 00:58:01.000
up right so can you see how the cult Works can

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:09.920
you see how the cult Works do you understand now why Jesus is able to calm down people who are in tombs raving and

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:18.400
mad do you understand why because that's part of the freaking cult right Paul's doing the same thing it's not miraculous

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:25.280
oh right you were it's not even intended to be miraculous oh it's not it's the

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:31.720
reality that you can't read because you don't read the language right good

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:38.760
that's why that's why ad and you were trying to get people trained so they can read it and last but not least and then

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:44.599
we're going to go I just have a couple hymns to finish off what happened right after this with Paul so you and I are

00:58:44.599 --> 00:58:50.359
sitting in this Village and we see these seven sons of the high priest the Jewish

00:58:50.359 --> 00:58:55.440
High priests go into this house with this dude next thing you know we hear all this commotion and they're running

00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:01.559
out nude and beaten up right um what is the community

00:59:01.559 --> 00:59:10.039
response to this incident it's here in Acts 19:19 people came together took their

00:59:10.039 --> 00:59:16.960
magic books and burned them it was so much the cost the value it says they

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:26.960
estimated the value of the books to be around Morad pente a myriad is 10,000

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:34.640
coin right so five of those so 50,000 coin

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:41.760
worth of Magic books now I'm going to tell you something you have been told

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:48.760
for years by biblical Scholars by Scholars of biblical

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:56.599
theology you've been told that only the very few people read in antiquity oh

00:59:56.599 --> 01:00:04.240
these this is a land a fairy tale land where nobody reads it's only the extremely rich it's only the extremely

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:10.520
rich dude in this one location this is asiia minor in this one

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:16.960
location they've got more than 50,000 bucks worth of magic Scrolls you know

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:22.280
what that says says people are reading a lot more people than you think are

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:27.880
reading and it turns out that's true look at the library that we find the

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:35.680
Romans are complaining the giant Public Library those Christians they burned it down it was their Public

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:42.280
Library God they're burning them down all over Rome there's not just one library in Rome this was the big famous

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:34.880
last breath that he had Jesus Christ did Jesus Christ

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:41.160
did sabak Thor right he did exactly what somebody

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:48.279
who was in The Cult would do and remember Jesus Christ in the first century is technically since Judaism

01:02:48.279 --> 01:02:54.039
only goes back to the third Jesus Christ is technically I mean the monist Judaism

01:02:54.039 --> 01:03:00.359
not the Jewish people right not the ethnic group I'm talking about the manism that is

01:03:00.359 --> 01:03:06.520
Judaism that thing only goes back to the 3 Century so technically Jesus is a

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:12.000
founder of Judaism isn't that odd no it's not odd that somebody who's going

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.400
to cause a contention or you know take over the territory from the holy

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:25.960
priesthood right it's just because he could do it better than the priests could right remember the Magi those drug

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:31.680
headed drug dealers right they're the ones who brought the whole hey here's the drugs

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:40.440
and the money bruh right so Jesus could do it better he got his education down in Egypt the people in Jerusalem

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:47.200
involved with the temple they were sending their people out down there to learn Greek Jesus had to go down and do

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:54.240
that right so it's no wonder that they're all the rabbis are all saying dude this guy is brilliant right and not

01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:00.960
only that he can put you into a state right he can put you into a state give me the next one give me the next one um

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:02.000
sense that we would return to her as the Muse you know they called her the Muse

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:11.000
right who is it who's with who' the Jews worship again before they worshiped Yahoo the misogynous God they worshiped

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.960
Aphrodite you're kidding me who did they they did it through bacus the worship of

bakas yes because you can't have Aphrodite without bacas they go hand in hand thank you

01:05:24.359 --> 01:05:29.720
plutar now for the Jewish ethnic Community who can who wants to see their

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:34.799
Origins imagine your Creon ancestors right before they had

01:05:34.799 --> 01:05:41.760
immigrated to the Levant imagine your Creon ancestors worshiping this Divine

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:48.799
pair Aphrodite and bacus Aphrodite and bacus isn't that

01:05:48.799 --> 01:05:56.200
something you thought Adonis was some crusty crusty Desert god no no no he's

01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:02.760
not he's not he's the lover he's the lover of

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:09.279
urania isn't that nice the lover of urania that's the culture that you come

01:06:09.279 --> 01:06:15.440
from now um on the Muslim side you come

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:20.480
from the bakic adherence of a right that was

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:27.440
perpetuated that made it all the way to Arabia what we call what they called

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:32.640
Arabia and that's where you come from that's why you've got that Big Stone

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:39.160
right um that's why that your original devotions were to that goddess of

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:44.559
intercourse I know things have changed I know things have changed but that's how

01:06:44.559 --> 01:06:51.640
it started out and it seemed to be because at the time they didn't have jihads the followers of Aphrodite never

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:56.760
had jihads on anyone it's a it's a phenomenon of theism right if you think

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:02.839
about it what is a Jihad right that action is against it's exclusive of One

01:07:02.839 --> 01:07:10.319
Core monest group right you've got to perform that action against those who are on the outside of the fence right

01:07:10.319 --> 01:07:18.240
put your burka on right um you're in the fence everybody else yeah terrible

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:23.680
idolators call them ever what whatever you want right but those polytheists

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:28.960
were your ancestors give me the next one um I wanted to go give me the next one

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:34.839
go ahead I wanted to show you here at the top I just want you to see that this is

01:07:34.839 --> 01:07:40.279
Aphrodite who is called Lucina the end of the first line Lucina um Lucina is

01:07:40.279 --> 01:07:46.920
like a draina the draina is the Priestess of the dragon and the Lucina

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:52.440
is the Priestess of the wolf of the wolf and what is this wolf

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:57.440
Priestess used look at the fourth line down last

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:04.960
[Music] words you know that filtron is a drug

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:11.880
right it's a concoction right a filter you can call it and they're usually sexual that one's

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:18.318
called aom Mania drug right the one that causes you

01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:24.080
to enter into erotic Mania now I want to say this and I know I know Neil is

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:31.480
waiting in the wings so I'm going to finish up here but I want to say this the erotic Mania if you have never in

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:39.798
your life entered into erotic Mania I'm sorry that you haven't had

01:08:39.799 --> 01:08:45.719
that religious experience I'm

01:08:45.719 --> 01:08:52.560
sorry but they made that religious experience the

01:08:52.560 --> 01:09:04.080
centrality of their salvation coming to grips with that climax is part

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:11.400
of the death process and rebirth yeah if you think about it it's

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:20.238
sort of makes sense it sort of makes sense we don't send a person to the Moon we put them into a state where they

01:09:20.239 --> 01:09:26.480
can go beyond death and be brought back on a tether and with they come back

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:32.560
they're full of that Knowledge full of that knowledge and if we guide them properly we can tell them when you see

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:38.600
this do this do this right from our people who have already been going back and forth and who are the people who go

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:44.278
back and forth on a regular basis the oracles why do you think they always

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:51.400
know the future because when you're detached according to their physics when you're detached from this existence that

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:57.800
is material you become aware I don't know why they said this but you become

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:02.840
aware of all time right it's like ghosts in the

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:08.040
Underworld somehow know or watching us they get some

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:13.920
absorbed you know uh Vision right that's why your ancestors

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:21.960
um either hate you or love you right you you you didn't realize it but you're living this specifically for their

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:28.000
benefit right it's weird it's a strange way to look at the world I think it's quite Noble though I think it's quite

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.920
Noble um and I think it Bears you know we need to look at it give me the next one and we're done and I want to give

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:40.480
you one more one more hymn here I want you to see this is milleni and I want

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:50.159
you to see that she is that konian nymph who wears that hectic gown atic

01:10:50.159 --> 01:10:56.960
gown this is we're on the witch side now you didn't know Aphrodite was actually a witch did you you didn't know Aphrodite

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:03.719
was actually a witch what does this one do what does meleno do she

01:11:03.719 --> 01:11:11.000
myus and this is the perfect way to end because that means she causes people to

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:19.360
enter insanity and if you look at the very if you look at the um um second to last

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:26.920
line the third word in oyon what do we want from her we want oy

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:36.080
right this is the same cult person that you and I have been looking at that we call Media this is the same cult person

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:41.520
she has to be performing that right right she has to be she is the source

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:47.440
it's her body and blood that is the source of our Salvation right that's how

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:54.159
we manage these jumps to death and back right now we can do this in tombs we can

01:11:54.159 --> 01:11:59.280
do it with the right drug we can do it with people walking around oh God there's another one revive that one

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:06.159
right this is the world that produced Christianity If

01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:15.600
This Modern Age is to produce another Christianity it will not come out of any

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:22.920
churches it'll come out of movements mass movements of people who enter into

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:31.639

um projects working on and collaborations and stuff like that um I do want to I so you said a lot there

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:17.520
that I want to complement I got some sources first of all I have a source

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.880
from herius now real quick before you before you bring up my screen I just want to say something real quick there's

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:28.520
a story about Pythagoras and his life is pretty fascinating you

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:35.400
know he grew up in Ionia he travels to Athens and he becomes part of this old

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:42.480
presocratic Academy whatever it is pre PL platonic Academy and um he travels to

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:47.560
Egypt and learns the mysteries of the Egyptians he travels to Babylon learns the trips of the B and then when he

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:54.600
comes back he sets up a school in Croton Italy which is Magna Gracia at the time

01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:01.080
greater greater Greece they call it Greeks were inhabiting most of Italy at that time Latins are just a little tiny

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:07.280
little baby at that time they don't they're not ruling [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but the Greeks are spreading you know so everyone

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:13.560
thinks of Hellenism as like this post 330 ad or BC phenomena it's like once

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:20.280
you actually start reading the history helenismo Ander it's taken over the

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:26.520
world just culturally so Pythagoras goes to croon Italy and he sets up a school

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:32.239
there and the school the first thing he says to the people out there is the first thing we're going to build is a

01:14:32.239 --> 01:14:39.639
temple to the mes so he builds the first thing they build is a giant beautiful temple with

01:14:39.639 --> 01:14:47.400
probably Corinthian or ionic columns Doric columns whatever beautiful Temple to the nine Muses which is what I want

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:53.880
to focus on people always ask me Neil you want to tear down the abrahamic religions what are you going to replace

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:59.159
it with and it's very simple it's the religion of the M of the

01:14:59.159 --> 01:15:05.639
Muse that's it it's the religion of inspiration it's the religion of art it's the religion of poetry it's the

01:15:05.639 --> 01:15:11.520
religion of theater it's a religion of divine Madness that anybody can attain

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:19.120
that you don't need to go through a priesthood of Elders to get to anybody can get to it

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:25.560
all right so we're going to touch on that but first of all pull up my uh source that I have here this is

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:32.360
I just pulled this up because in 450 BCE Herodotus goes on and travels the world

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:38.440
sort of like Pythagoras did but he was inspired by Cleo the Muse of History

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:45.400
he's the first historian they call him the father of History so he travels to Egypt he travels to he travels to the

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:51.440
cians he meets with the cians and talks about their learns about their history he learns about Indian history he learns

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:58.400
about Babylonian history he learns about Persian history the med median history uh what else he learns about Anatolian

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:03.440
history he learns about you know Libyan history he's talking about you know he's

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:10.960
talking to the elders in Libya he's talking to Phoenicians about their history he's learning about all these

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:17.920
histories and then he goes to this little area that we call Sin he doesn't mention Israel or

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:24.639
Jerusalem or or Jews or or is or Judaism but he does say something that I think I

01:16:24.639 --> 01:16:31.880
think we can tie to judeans he says they deem none other to

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:39.239
be Gods except for dionisis and Heavenly Aphrodite that's Uranian Aphrodite

01:16:39.239 --> 01:16:45.440
Aphrodite Ur uranos that's title of this video and they say that the cropping of the hair

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:51.800
is like the cropping of the hair of dionis cutting it around the head shaving the temples they call dionisis

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:57.400
oral tot and Aphrodite alot all all right interesting they only have two

01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:04.480
gods that they honor it's Aphrodite and dianis now why did he do that he's doing some Greco interpret asio here he's

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:09.719
saying that he's looking at these rights and he's comparing them and he's saying there's definitely a dianis and

01:17:09.719 --> 01:17:15.159
Aphrodite cult set up here in this desert so I'm going to compare that to

01:17:15.159 --> 01:17:21.239
what we got in the CH the caldan oracles where they say the dionisis or bakus was

01:17:21.239 --> 01:17:28.320
called by the calans yaho we you know we always always bring this verse up this is just relative to what I'm talking

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:36.000
about in The Phoenician tongue he is frequently called Sab o who is above the seven poles the Demi

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:42.040
ergus and then we find in the oldest manuscripts that we have of the of the

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:49.239
Greek septu agent the name yaho is present all right I got some sto some

01:17:49.239 --> 01:17:56.440
sources that I want to run through that have that are related to this the first one I got

01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:04.000
is about dianis and Apollo and the muses and where do they come from

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.440
so let me find my source real quick here it

01:18:11.719 --> 01:18:17.560
is um actually that's not it

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:25.760
it's this one what did I do with it

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:30.079
okay hold on one second let me pull this

01:18:32.199 --> 01:18:38.000
up chewy wants me to take some heat off you while you do that um I'll make notes

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:47.000
by the the way for people I'll just say this quick for people who are taking the Greek whether it's at amenu or um at in

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:53.320
my studio uh the class lab is on

01:18:53.320 --> 01:19:00.800
Saturday and full steam ahead for those of you who want to go in and say hey can we talk about this sentence from chapter

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:06.239
two or chapter one Whatever whatever you happen to be the mood for what oh it's

01:19:06.239 --> 01:19:13.480
sorry um unit two or unit one sorry about that um so yeah please feel free

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:21.120
to attend and we've got that um link uh chewy says uh we'll put up that link so

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:27.600
did that give you enough time there oh yeah I got it I'm ready to go okay you so and before I even touch on this I

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:33.840
want to say something about the last source that I had there is that um during the time that Herodotus is

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:42.239
traveling the world in 450 remember what's going on at that time there is no Torah yet nobody knows about Judaism yet

01:19:42.239 --> 01:19:48.080
doesn't exist yet it's just not there simply the gods that are the main Gods

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:53.800
and this is this is actually the reason why I think that source is relevant because the main Gods that are worshiped

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:58.880
in Jerusalem at that time is Asher and

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:06.159
Yahweh they're the head of the pantheon and they were side by side at that time period even as late as 450 BCE you would

01:20:06.159 --> 01:20:12.480
go there and they would have coins minted of of Athena they would have coins mitted with

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:18.280
Zeus on them they were just part of the Mediterranean world like everyone else that's why herst just went there and

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:23.679
thought this is business as usual nothing nothing nothing to see here nothing crazy out of the ordinary just

01:20:23.679 --> 01:20:30.080
regular Mediterranean life happening in Judea which is fascinating now I think

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:35.440
who is this dionis that's the question who is this Eastern dionisis I think

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:43.400
it's Osiris and I I'm I'm gonna get into that right now all right this Source right

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:48.880
here I'm going to share I'm gonna make this a little bit bigger so people can see it and read

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:56.760
it he said this is from diodorus of sicy he says Osiris by the way the the old uh

01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:02.280
pronunciation is yo yos Cirus yo

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:09.360
yoa Osiris and then it relates to yaho too that we find in cre so there's this

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:16.840
older ancient yaho presence going on in the Eastern Mediterranean over in cre

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:22.639
Egypt Judea that's my that's what I think right now let's keep going Osiris

01:21:22.639 --> 01:21:27.840
was the first they record to make mankind give up cannibalism for after

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:35.080
Isis had discovered the fruit of both wheat and barley which grew wild over the land along other plants which was

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:42.600
still unknown to mankind basically we got this god Osiris and Isis and they're taking Humanity out

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:48.760
of the Stone Age and civilizing them that's what's going on here so we got

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:55.560
the some cities during the Festival of Isis as well as stocks of Wheat by the way think about what he's doing here

01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:01.840
Deiter Deiter and Osiris are being equated with each other the demer and Isis I mean and then

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:06.920
Osiris and diis so you got the Festival of Isis stocks of Wheat and barley

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:13.639
carried among the objects in procession me Memorial of what the goddess in geniously discovered in the beginning

01:22:13.639 --> 01:22:22.239
Isis establishes laws in accordance with people regularly and uh for this reason the

01:22:22.239 --> 01:22:28.920
early Greek grave Deiter he see how he just switches up from Isis demer just quickly boom that's what that's daor for

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:34.320
you you gota be you got to be paying attention to what he's talking about he does this with dionisis and Osiris as

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:41.800
well for that reason the early Greeks gave deer the name thorus which means lawbringer law Bearer

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:49.440
by the way thesmophoria in uh in Greece in Athens was celebrated in the same week as the

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:55.199
judeans later on celebrate the Sak Festival in PL of the elders geniusly

01:22:55.199 --> 01:23:01.080
points this out in his moralia where he's worked comparing dionisis to Yahweh

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:07.679
they have a they have a festival in the same week they do this they do very similar things they carry palm trees and

01:23:07.679 --> 01:23:14.000
and uh Myrtle into the temple and I I think there's something going on there and I think he's right he says Osiris

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.679
they say founded the Egyptian thian city with a hundred gates with the men of this day after his mother the later

01:23:19.679 --> 01:23:27.280
generations called it deos diospolis and it says right here Osiris they add

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:34.480
built a temple to his parents Zeus and Hera which was famous for its size and its costess in general and two golden

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:40.159
chapels to Zeus the larger one to him as God Of Heaven the smaller one to him as

01:23:40.159 --> 01:23:46.960
former King and father of the Egyptians in the role as he is called by some

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:53.600
Ammon he also made golden chapels for the rest of the Gods mentioned above allotting honors to each of them and

01:23:53.600 --> 01:24:00.719
appointing priests to have charge over these special esteem at the court of Osiris and Isis was also accorded to

01:24:00.719 --> 01:24:06.920
these which should invent any of the Arts or device of any useful

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:14.960
process here's where here's where we get into the muses ready I'm getting there Osiris they say was also interested in

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:22.800
agriculture and was reared in Nissa a city of Arabia huh Felix near

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:28.760
Egypt being a son of Zeus and the name which he Bears among

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:33.920
the Greeks is derived from both his father and from his birthplace and he is

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:40.719
called dionisis mention is also made of Nissa and by The Poets in in in his by the

01:24:40.719 --> 01:24:46.000
poet in his hymns he's talking about Homer to the effect of this vicinity of

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:52.400
Egypt so this is old homeric from the 8th Century BC he says there is a certain

01:24:52.400 --> 01:25:00.560
Nissa Mountain High with forests thick in Phoenicia afar close to Egypt

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:08.119
streams and the discovery of the vine they say was made by him near Nissa and that by having further despi

01:25:08.119 --> 01:25:14.719
devised the proper treatment of its fruit he was the first to drink wine and taught mankind at the larger uh culture

01:25:14.719 --> 01:25:22.560
of the vine Blah Blah Blah by the way the word for wine in Hebrew is yahan and uh that comes from the it

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:28.639
comes from the Greek wos wos so there's obviously some sort of boring happening

01:25:28.639 --> 01:25:33.960
um even the oldest cities that Yahweh was worshiped in the the minites are the

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:39.760
the midianites are are Mo most Scholars would say Yahweh gets bored from because

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.840
in remember in the north the ugaritic attack there's no Yahweh just L and Bale

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:50.440
and Ashera and then down in the south in these midianite cities you get Yahweh

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:55.679
and then the archaeology says that midianite cities are using

01:25:55.679 --> 01:26:03.360
uh aan Pottery so they're culturally connected with the Ean something to think about this is my

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:11.880
this is sort of my theory that I'm building here so here we go here's where we get to the

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:18.840
muses Osiris established the Affairs of Egypt and turned the supreme power over to his wife Isis and they say that he

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:24.800
placed Hermes at her side as counselor because of his Prudence raised him above the king's other friends and general of

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:29.960
all the land and sway he left Hercules who was both his Kinsman and renowned

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:36.560
for his Valor and physical strength while as Governors he appointed buus over these parts of Egypt which lie

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:41.639
toward Phoenicia and it was Apollo they say who

01:26:41.639 --> 01:26:47.040
discovered the Laurel a Garland of which all men place about the head of his God

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:52.119
above all others the discovery of Ivy is also attributed to Osiris by the

01:26:52.119 --> 01:26:57.280
Egyptians and made sacred to this God just as the Greeks do in

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:03.800
dianis and in the Egyptian language they say that Ivy is called the plant of

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:09.080
Osiris and for purposes dedication is preferred to the vine since the ladder

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:15.080
sheds its leaves while the former ever remains green the same rule more

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:21.440
moreover and ancients have followed in the case of other plants also which are perennially green describing for

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:26.679
instance the Myrtle of Aphrodite and the Laurel to Apollo this is very

01:27:26.679 --> 01:27:33.600
important for the religion of the Muse you got to know these that the Myrtle is dedicated to Aphrodite when people get

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:39.119
married they wear Myrtle that's the symbol of love dianis is the vine symbol

01:27:39.119 --> 01:27:47.560
of Madness divine inspiration of the madness that we get from the vine Apollo wears the Laurel the symbol

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:53.800
of Triumph and glory and and uh when there's a Triumph the Caesars would wear

01:27:53.800 --> 01:28:00.159
low up they're following this ancient ritual Osiris was accompanied on his

01:28:00.159 --> 01:28:06.600
campaign as the Egyptian account goes by his two sons Anubis and Macedon who were distinguished in their Valor both of

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:12.119
them carried most notable accortt of War taken from certain animals whose

01:28:12.119 --> 01:28:17.560
character was not unlike the boldness of the men Anubis wearing a dog skin and

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:24.520
Macedon the four parts of a wolf and for this reason these animals are held in honor of the Egyptians he also o took

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:30.520
pan Along on his campaign who was held in special Honor by the Egyptians for the inhabitants of the land not only set

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:38.239
up statues of him at every Temple but have also named a city after him in thead called after the natives kmno

01:28:38.239 --> 01:28:45.520
which is translated mean city of pan talking about canis there that's kind of crazy in his company there were

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:51.360
also who were experienced in agriculture such as Mar the cultivation of the vine and tripus and the sewing of the Grain

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:58.000
in every step apart of it and he says uh this is where this is where the mus comes in while they were

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.159
in Ethiopia their account continues the SAT people were brought to him who they

01:29:03.159 --> 01:29:08.920
say have hair upon their loins for Osiris was laughter-loving now remember

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:15.600
last time I was here we talked about the Byzantine law codes that banned laughter

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:22.360
if you were a agricultural Vine um Vineyard worker he worked in

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:29.600
Vineyards it was actually forbidden for you to laugh while you were producing the while you were cultivating the vine

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:36.639
and producing wine because that would mean that you were following the rights of the ancient dionan religion isn't

01:29:36.639 --> 01:29:44.320
that crazy so this is actually very important laughter-loving God fond of Music and Dance consequently he took

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:51.199
with him a multitude of musicians among whom were nine maidens who could sing and were trained

01:29:51.199 --> 01:29:57.159
in other Arts these maidens being those among the Greeks were called the muses

01:29:57.159 --> 01:30:03.639
and their leader musagetes as the count goes was Apollo who was for that reason

01:30:03.639 --> 01:30:09.040
also given the name mettus as for the SATs they were taken

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:15.920
along in the campaign because they were proficient in dancing and singing and every kind of relaxation of Pastime for

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:23.119
Osiris was not warlike nor did he have to organize pitch battles or engagements since every people received him as God

01:30:23.119 --> 01:30:31.360
because of his benefit factions now this is where this is where I wanted to um I

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:37.800
wanted to take a step back from this screen right now and pull up who these n Muses actually

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:43.880
are so I got my other screen ready to go it is over

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:51.960
here it won't take me long at all here it is so we got the nine Muses ready to go

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:58.239
who are they remember there's nine of them three of them

01:30:58.239 --> 01:31:04.760
are inspired by dionis Madness three of them are inspired by

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:11.719
Aphrodite love three of them are inspired by Apollo the leader of the muses right so

01:31:11.719 --> 01:31:17.400
you have different kinds of inspiration people are inspired by love people are

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:26.119
inspired by Madness and people are inspired by Randomness from the gods themselves so you have hel ope she's the

01:31:26.119 --> 01:31:31.600
goddess of epic poetry right Cleo we talked about

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:38.320
already The Muse of history and Lear playing

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:43.639
polymnia the goddess of hymns means many hymns in Greek

01:31:43.639 --> 01:31:49.119
P elpe the lyric poetry

01:31:49.119 --> 01:31:55.840

of astronomy right and then there there you have Apollo standing amongst the nine

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:30.199
muses and so we have a really interesting passage that I want to read real quick

01:32:30.199 --> 01:32:37.760
I'm almost getting towards the end of it this is gonna you're gonna like this where Socrates and um you know I we talk about

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:46.320
Plato we talk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about Plato a lot as his monism sort of corrupted the world I think but he did have a muse he and

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:51.600
there are some there are some dialogues by Plato that are very important especially the one that I'm about to

01:32:51.600 --> 01:33:01.440
read right now this is from fith pis and so let me pull up my screen

01:33:02.679 --> 01:33:08.280
again so okay this is from fedis from 244

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:14.520
fedis he says this former discourse was by fedis the son of

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:22.920
Pyles of mirus but which I shall speak of storus Son of euphemus Man of speech

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:28.600
all right and this is now this is Socrates speaking this is one of the

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:36.239
few dialogues about Socrates that I actually think he said something similar to this so remember Plato's writing this

01:33:36.239 --> 01:33:42.280
down after Socrates is dead and he's looking he's thinking back of the past and he's writing these dialogues go what

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:49.400
would Socrates have said about this here I'm gonna write this down I think he's I think Plato is spot on here I think this

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:55.600
is one of the few dialogues that play Socrates might have said something like this so let's let's what it says and I

01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:02.760
must say this things saying is not true which teaches when a lover is at hand

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:09.719
the non-lover should be more favored because the lover is insane and the other is

01:34:09.719 --> 01:34:15.600
sane for it would be a simple fact that insanity is an evil the saying would be

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:22.600
true but in reality the greatest of blessings come to us through Madness

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:28.560
what this is the this is the religion that I I want to bring back right here I'm

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:34.920
serious when it was sent as a gift of the Gods for the propheus at Deli now

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:41.159
remember what is dely Delphie is where the ancient Oracle was the most famous famous Oracle of the ancient world

01:34:41.159 --> 01:34:46.400
people would travel all the way from India to go visit the Oracle and they

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:52.880
would get the oracles about the future and at dely is the dedicated a shrine to

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:59.080
the nine muses of course Apollo was on the top of the mountain and on the bottom of the mountain guess what you

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:04.520
had there you had a tomb a tomb of the burial of

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:12.159
dionis wait why is dianis in a tomb because dianis is is the god of resurrection and death you know Apollo

01:35:12.159 --> 01:35:18.760
stands on top of the mountain because he's the Heavenly he's the Heavenly Son of God right and Aphrodite is the

01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:23.800
goddess is the is the is the third of the Triad she brings the love all right

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:28.840
what what happens here the Priestess at daona it's one of the ancient seven

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:34.679
wonders of the world where the palas Zeus I'm not kidding it's called the plastic Zeus was set up and they don't

01:35:34.679 --> 01:35:40.800
even know how old it was goes back to like who knows it was just it's just there when history starts getting

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:45.920
written Dona is there already we don't know when Dona was built it's the oldest

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:52.119
Oracle of Zeus that exists when they have been made conferred by many Splendid benefits upon

01:35:52.119 --> 01:35:57.280
Greece both in private and public affairs but few are none when they have

01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:04.679
been in their right minds and if we should speak of the cibil and all others who are who by

01:36:04.679 --> 01:36:10.880
prophetic inspiration have foretold many things to many persons and thereby made them

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:16.159
fortunate afterwards anyone can see that we should speak a long time and it is

01:36:16.159 --> 01:36:23.119
worthwhile to induce also the fact that those men of old who invented names thought that Madness was neither

01:36:23.119 --> 01:36:30.960
shameful nor disgraceful otherwise they would not have connected the very word Mania with

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:38.080
the noblest of Arts Which F which foretells the future by calling it manic

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:44.600
art no they gave this name thinking Mania which it comes by the gift of the

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:51.239
Gods is a noble thing but nowadays people call prophecy the Mantic art

01:36:51.239 --> 01:36:57.639
tastelessly inserting the te in the word so also when they give a name to the

01:36:57.639 --> 01:37:03.719
investigation of the future which rational persons conduct through observation of

01:37:03.719 --> 01:37:10.080
birds and but that's um that's the uh Roman art of

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:16.320
uh augury and by other signs they furnished the Mind

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:24.119
noose and information is Storia to human thought ois from intellect

01:37:24.119 --> 01:37:31.360
dioa they call it ooti art which modern folk Now call O

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:36.480
otic making it more High sounding by introducing the long o notice how they

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:41.560
they pay so much attention to the vowels and the way words are spelled it's crazy

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:47.679
how crazy this they take this so seriously but I love it the Ancients then testify that in proportion as

01:37:47.679 --> 01:37:54.320
prophecy man is superior to augury both in name and in fact in the

01:37:54.320 --> 01:38:02.719
same proportion Madness which comes from God is superior to sanity what wow this

01:38:02.719 --> 01:38:08.159
is mind-blowing which is of human origin moreover when diseases and the greatest

01:38:08.159 --> 01:38:13.320
troubles have been visited upon certain families through some ancient guilt

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:20.840
madness has entered in and by oracular power has found a way of release for

01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:27.239
those in need taking refuge in prayers and the service of the Gods and so by

01:38:27.239 --> 01:38:33.440
purifications and sacred rights he who has this madness is made safe for the

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:40.719
present and after time for him who is rightly possessed of Madness or release from

01:38:40.719 --> 01:38:47.360
present ills is found and a third kind of possession Madness comes from the

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:54.320
muses so we got dionan madness appolloni madness now a third kind of Madness from

01:38:54.320 --> 01:39:01.520
the mes this takes hold upon a gentle and pure Soul arouses it and inspires it to

01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:08.119
songs and other poetry and thus by adorning countless Deeds of the ancient Ed of the Ancients educates later

01:39:08.119 --> 01:39:13.960
generations but he without the Divine Madness comes to the doors of the muses

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:21.040
confident that will he will be a good Poet by Art meets with no success and the Poetry of some man vanishes into

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:28.159
nothingness before that of inspiring I got one more thing I want to look

01:39:31.119 --> 01:39:37.840
at and um all right so yeah he's basically explaining here I don't have to I can um go to the next one he's

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:42.920
basically explaining here that um you have different kinds of Madness

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:48.080
different kinds of divine inspiration and uh you get mat you get

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.840
the the nine Muses that can be either sent by Aphrodite which is love Dian

01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:59.280
which is De Mania and apollonian inspiration of the

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:07.560
song so so it's sent for three things now last thing I want to

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:13.639
show is um there's a passage from Plutarch about

01:40:13.639 --> 01:40:20.360
dianis and and um and Osiris if you want to pull this up I have it ready to go so

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:29.480
he says he says this is fascinating stuff now we're talking Herodotus was writing in 450 this is 500 years later

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:38.480
and plutar comes along and this is what he has to say Osiris is identical with OS with

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:43.679
dianis who could be more fitting to Know Than yourself Cleo for you are the head

01:40:43.679 --> 01:40:49.920
of the inspired maidens of Deli huh and have been consecrated by

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:57.440
your father and mother in the Holy rights of Osiris what is going on if however for the

01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:04.840
benefit of others is needful to aduce proofs of this identity let us have undisturbed what may not be told but in

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:10.920
the public ceremonies which the priests perform and the barrial of apus that's

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:19.400
the bull this is very important for the Mysteries the bull is slain and the bull is buried and They

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:24.440
Mourn it's agricultural but it's also has it that's also

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:29.840
spiritual and when they convey his body on improvised beer do not in any way

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:35.159
come sort of a bakic pression for they fasten skins of fawns about themselves

01:41:35.159 --> 01:41:40.719
and carry bakic wands and indulge in shoutings and movements exactly as those

01:41:40.719 --> 01:41:47.840
do who are under the spell of dionesia ecstasies for the same reason many of

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:53.320
the Greeks make statues of dionisis in the form of a bow and the women at Ellis

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:59.360
invoke him praying that the god may come with the hoof of a bowl and the epithet

01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:05.000
applied to dionisis among the argives is son of a bull they call upon him by the

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:12.440
water of the sound of trumpets out of the water they call upon him out of the water so out of this baptism they have

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:19.280
the sound of the voice of God what do that reminds you of at the same time casting Into the

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:27.320
Depths a lamb you that's not a that's not a Miss typ not typo a lamb as an offering to

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:34.000
The Keeper of the gate The Trumpets They conceal in Bak wands as Sac Socrates has

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.599
stated in his Treatise the holy ones now you're probably

01:42:39.599 --> 01:42:45.199
wondering what the hell is this treaties that Socrates wrote we lost it but we do

01:42:45.199 --> 01:42:53.760
know what it's called the word oion the holy ones that Socrates wrote

01:42:53.760 --> 01:43:00.440
is the word oion huh oion what is that word I thought I thought the word for

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:06.599
Holy is either seba sabba or Hira or um

01:43:06.599 --> 01:43:13.760
hagio this the Greek has nine words for every everything this is just one of the few words one of the many words for holy

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:20.800
ones but let's see what Alice has to say about this this is very important let me pull up my

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:28.480
screen and let's go to this oos ready for this this is crazy so

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:36.480
Socrates wrote a text called on the holy ones called on the oon that's where the word Osiris comes from so yes the word

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.520
Osiris does have connection to Greek believe it or not as ancient as Osiris

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:48.000
is so is Greek this is one of those one of those weird things that make you think how old is

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.880
Greek so what does this word mean it means hollow Divine Law or to make holy

01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:59.040
ready for this let's see what the lsj says hollowed sanctioned or Allowed by

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:05.000
the law of gods of nature DK sanctioned by Divine

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:10.880
Law what you telling me Osiris's name is is is Greek and it means to be

01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:17.320
sanctioned by Divine Law that's what it says here look at this permitted or not

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:24.440
forbidden by Divine Law of person's Pious devout religious

01:44:25.639 --> 01:44:32.040
oos all right check this out right so the bowl

01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:38.199
the bll which is represented by dionis and apis

01:44:38.199 --> 01:44:45.760
is the bow that is slain now if you know if you know anything about the mysteries of Addis

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:50.880
they washed their initiates in the blood of a of a blood of a bow just like

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:58.960
Christ just like when you're initiated in Christ in the Bible it says wash I think it's first John first John is the

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:04.080
is the chapter where it says that you are washed in the blood of the Lamb your

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:12.239
initiates in Christianity are washed in the blood of the Lamb so um look at

01:45:12.719 --> 01:45:19.400
this so if you actually you look really closely in this it's very hard to see it

01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:25.119
but right right here I can see it right now you might not be able to see it but if you can look this up if you want check

01:45:25.119 --> 01:45:32.040
fact check me right here it actually says seaso s e b s i o there's the S

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:38.599
right there there's the E right there there's the B there's the E there's the S there's the I there's the O it's very

01:45:38.599 --> 01:45:47.560
hard to see but if you look it up it's France Kuma is the first one to spot this out seaso is the name of dianis sa

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:54.400
sabazius it also means holy sa sabba means holy so Osiris down

01:45:54.400 --> 01:46:01.239
in Egypt means holy sabazius up in friia means holy it's the same exact it's

01:46:01.239 --> 01:46:09.560
they're literally translations of each other they're both Vine Gods they're both gods of the the of the vine of the

01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:15.000
uh of Ivy they both wear Ivy um they both die and resurrect and

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.560
they're both both both of them are represented by a bull whether it's the apis bull or this ter Tauros and their

01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:28.719
their blood washes new initiates you're saved by the blood of the bull

01:46:29.159 --> 01:46:37.639
right look at this all right um I don't know why it's

01:46:37.639 --> 01:46:44.639
taking so long from this for this thing the load oh here it is okay ready for

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:51.679
this Revelation 7:14 sir thou knowest these

01:46:51.679 --> 01:46:57.599
are them that came out of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the

01:46:57.599 --> 01:47:04.719
Lamb that's mystery religion language guys they're taking the lamb from the

01:47:04.719 --> 01:47:11.760
bowl the bowl represents veril and strength and power the lamb is meekness so they're flipping the mystery

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:17.719
into a different this is what they want their their followers to be meek this is what they want to This Is How They want

01:47:17.719 --> 01:47:23.040
to run their civilization into this what the Mystic priests are doing it's

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:29.080
actually kind of fascinating if you think about it all right lastly I want to show one more thing from

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:36.040
Lucian I love Lucian by the way um Lucian Lucian has some

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:41.239
interesting things to say he's the last I want to say the last

01:47:41.239 --> 01:47:46.960
great um the last great Pagan Roman to

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:53.599
ever live and he says some crazy stuff um

01:47:53.599 --> 01:47:59.560
that's the wrong page let me just pull up this last page real quick and then I I this is this

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:04.280
will tie everything together I promise he

01:48:04.599 --> 01:48:12.040
says what did I do with it oh I got it actually I got it it's

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:17.159
over here Lucian let me go to Lucian real

01:48:17.159 --> 01:48:24.760
quick all right here it is so Lu here it is right here so this is from

01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:29.960
Lucian him to the mother of the Gods he's talking about the mithraic

01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:35.199
religion this is the last strata of paganism that ever existed and he says

01:48:35.199 --> 01:48:40.800
something very interesting down here a little

01:48:41.679 --> 01:48:48.679
bit he says Perhaps it is worth to raise the following question there are two

01:48:48.679 --> 01:48:53.800
equinoxes but men pay more honor to the Equinox in the sign of Capricorn than is

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:59.199
the sign of Cancer surely the reason for this is evident since the sun begins to

01:48:59.199 --> 01:49:04.639
approach us immediately after the Spring Equinox for I need not to say that the

01:49:04.639 --> 01:49:10.239
days begin to lengthen this seemed to be more agreeable season for aart the

01:49:10.239 --> 01:49:15.560
explanation which says that light accompanies the gods you must believe

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:23.520
that the uplifting rays of the sun are nearly akin to those who yearn to be set free from generation

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:30.760
down here he says for when with our eyes we perceive

01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:37.239
the Sun's light not only is it welcome and useful for our lives but also the Divine Plato said when he sang its

01:49:37.239 --> 01:49:43.159
Praises it is our guide to wisdom and if I should also touch on the secret

01:49:43.159 --> 01:49:51.000
teachings of the Mysteries in which the caldan divinely frenzy celebrated the god of the seven

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.920
rays that God through whom he lifts up The Souls of

01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:02.400
men I should be saying what is intelligible yeah wholly unintelligible

01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:10.840
to the common heard but familiar to the Happy theorist he's basically say those who have ears to hear right

01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:18.040
now the seven raised God we know in just in many depictions is Soul Invictus or

01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:23.800
mythus but there is another seven raid God who comes a lot later in history

01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:32.280
recently to us and that's this God so somebody the architect of the

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:38.000
great of the great Statue of Liberty who holds up that that that torch the light

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:44.760
bear Lucifer that architect I looked I looked into this person a lot this person was a

01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:50.320
Freemason very Mystic um very into the Mysteries and I would not be surprised

01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:57.679
if this was inspired by the raised God of Julian the the goddess libertas

01:50:57.679 --> 01:51:03.400
that's who that is that's Libera so that's the mystery and that's

01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:09.480
that's the muses right there it's about so so to to sum it all up to what I'm just what I'm getting at the religion

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:14.880
that I want to replace Christianity Judaism in Abra and um in um Islam with

01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:21.480
is the religion that's not dogmatic doesn't require you to believe anything doesn't require you to say something

01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:28.199
happened in the past that you have to know about you don't nobody's requiring you to know any of that stuff it's all

01:51:28.199 --> 01:51:34.440
is saying is that you can have divine inspiration too anyone can it's the religion of the Muse it's a religion of

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:40.960
inspiration it's a religion of poetry it's a religion of music religion of film theater

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:47.119
love Madness and that has no dog dogmatism at all

01:51:47.119 --> 01:51:52.199
required and that means that what Christianity came along and did was it

01:51:52.199 --> 01:51:58.920
took way divine inspiration this was the last debate between the gnostics and the and the Orthodoxy what were they

01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:05.119
debating what were they trying to fight over divine inspiration the most important thing in the world the those

01:52:05.119 --> 01:52:11.639
gnostics were saying divine inspiration can come to anybody and the church was saying no no no no no only the Bishops

01:52:11.639 --> 01:52:16.920
can have divine inspiration we're the only ones that can have it no one else is allowed to have it they took all that

01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:21.960
power to themselves they pretty much ended religion as we know it they pretty

01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:27.639
much killed the gods there's a reason why Plutarch got the Oracle that the

01:52:27.639 --> 01:52:34.280
great God pan was dead as Christianity was Rising that's what it

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:41.360
is that's it gorgeous the death of inspiration

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:48.520
such a somber note to end that gorgeous chorus that was

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:55.119
fantastic um I was looking through some of your some of your Source work is in

01:52:55.119 --> 01:53:01.400
my mind as you were going through it and uh I just wanted to say um very well

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:09.040
done it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of sources and people there's nothing that you can argue against just sources right because

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:16.239
it means you're not really putting anything forward but what's the actuality right like you doing court or

01:53:16.239 --> 01:53:21.960
something I think it's I think it's brilliant I want to ask you a question though I get first question and um

01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:31.320
anybody questions go ahead and put them in the comments and let's see um if we can get some answered but um I want to

01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:37.760
ask you what do you think the scholarly and

01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:46.400
Theological professional opinion will be of you talking about

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:54.639
this history um from these sources that shows things that are very different about Christianity and Juda ISM well how

01:53:54.639 --> 01:54:01.440
do you think this kind of stuff will be received how do you think a theologian or a pastor or somebody just watching

01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:07.800
who's been exposed to Christianity how do you think people will receive this I think whether they know it or not they

01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:13.400
might not know this but a lot of these Scholars of of Juda of of the

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:18.760
Bible are pawns that are being used to protect

01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:25.199
sacred history to protect the Bible to make sure that these two pillars stand up the

01:54:25.199 --> 01:54:30.840
two pillars are one that the Old Testament is very ancient it goes all the way back to the early Iron Age

01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:37.920
Bronze Age that's got to be there it's got that's got to be the oldest it's got to predate Homer they have to have that

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:43.840
happen because they want everything else to be inspired by it it can't be the other way around you can't you can't say

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:50.480
that the Bible starts around it gets finished you can't say the Bible's a product of the third Century BC because that's no that would kill the whole

01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:55.760
religion that would take the root out of the tree the second pillar is that Jesus

01:54:55.760 --> 01:55:01.119
is special and that Christianity is special and unique and inspired by God

01:55:01.119 --> 01:55:06.639
and that no paganism has any influence over it those two pillars have to stand

01:55:06.639 --> 01:55:12.920
so if anybody tries to encroach that they will be met they will be met with

01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:20.560
problems yeah what do you think our chances are because you know we've got the Bible and we can teach people the

01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:26.719
Bible what do you think our chances are if we just take it to them with the Bible and just show them everything

01:55:26.719 --> 01:55:31.800
that's in there or do you think ultimately there's going to be movements

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:39.480
against you know okay you can't say something bad about X Y or Z right

01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:45.079
because you're discriminating against us religiously do you think that the day is

01:55:45.079 --> 01:55:51.000
coming when there are laws that will be made that will make it illegal for us to

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:57.840
talk about such things so freely it's amazing how anybody's allow you can go

01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:03.159
ahead and you can say agam didn't exist and the Trojan War didn't happen that's

01:56:03.159 --> 01:56:09.280
all non you could say that if you wanted to right and people would say oh cool yeah but if you if you doubt Hebrew

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:16.840
Bible History all of a sudden you get slapped with this oh you're profaning Jewish

01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:23.079
history and that's anti-semitic wait I didn't say anything about Jewish people I'm talking about a

01:56:23.079 --> 01:56:29.480
taex that I don't think happened oh that's really that's really uh rude oh do you know that's anti you

01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:38.040
can't that's the people the people actually believe that and that that's it's like I don't care I don't care I can if if you're if

01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:44.159
I'm allowed to criticize other ancient mythologies and say those didn't happen

01:56:44.159 --> 01:56:49.480
then I can criticize this one too and I it's amazing how quick people will throw

01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:54.920
that word at you the as word the anti-semitic word just for pointing out

01:56:54.920 --> 01:57:00.960
things that are true right right and what's what's such a crime I think about

01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:06.960
that is that the actual history of the Jewish people is way more interesting

01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:14.119
right the very fact that they're part of these migrations through the aan you know and how does that influence their

01:57:14.119 --> 01:57:19.599
cultural development that's why wouldn't you want to know the reality why

01:57:19.599 --> 01:57:25.560
wouldn't you want to know uh I just don't get it what you showed with crazy

01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:31.040
it's crazy how this one area of of study has the special honors and it has this

01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:38.040
this little protection thing going on where to criticize it all of a sudden makes you evil or something it's it's

01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:44.199
like there's a lot I can say about that but that's we'll leave it at that for now it's um when you bring out the

01:57:44.199 --> 01:57:51.560
linguistic evidence you kind of show one of the things you said that I really liked was um nobody knows how old Greek

01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:57.800
is right and it you start pulling out the plasan into the equation and you're

01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:03.000
getting way before there's nothing in Egypt right yeah you got these you these

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.960
Scholars that I can't stand well there one of them on the top of my head right now who won't even say the word

01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:14.040
Yahweh they say Adonai because I don't want to be rude and say Yahweh it's a

01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:19.079
Divine name I can't say it but like then you have actual Jewish people saying

01:58:19.079 --> 01:58:26.880
Yahweh not caring it's like why are you look silly you look stupid right now and I I think you're fake as hell sorry I

01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:33.320
just think that's fake as hell yeah like why should I listen to you if you have this laws that you have to follow you

01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:40.199
can't even say Yahweh but you're I'm supposed to take you as as the as the scholar of this relig no you're showing

01:58:40.199 --> 01:58:46.320
me your bias right then and there it and I know and I know you're gonna protect this thing at all costs whatever there

01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:53.000
whenever there's a wash when it could go either way you're picking Jud you're picking sacred history over the TR over

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:58.560
over facts that's what it looks like yeah yeah yeah yeah totally totally we

01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:04.360
have to just work with the evidence so obvious it's so obvious that there if

01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:10.920
you can't even say the word Yahweh and you want me to think that you're uh you're a middle a middle a mediator

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:16.199
between the truth and no you're working for a you're playing on a team it's so

01:59:16.199 --> 01:59:25.960
obvious you know who you sound like you know who you sound like Neil you sound like Tuton Almon complaining about that

01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:32.800
monest worship of a 10 and how it overthrew Ammon you're talking like him

01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:39.360
um that's the that's the whole it's that totally repressive monest bent right

01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:47.840
like Judaism and Christianity Islam are not the only manifestations of um monest religions

01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:53.480
they're not and we know that when you know when when you have this phenomenon

01:59:53.480 --> 02:00:00.480
take place that you have immediately sensation look at where your creative stuff goes right look at where the what

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:06.079
you and I would call Freedom in the culture goes all of a sudden you've got groups that can be

02:00:06.079 --> 02:00:12.400
persecuted right all of that that is a monest tendency and if you read the

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:19.360
history going on around you you can take the temperature of the patient and sayoh look what you know what I think we're

02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:24.440
going to have persecutions now and we'll say it'll begin this way you can just

02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:30.040
replay that record of History you were doing some work with dark ages stuff

02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:35.800
tell me tell me did you ever get off and debate on the Dark Ages so I thought he

02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:42.280
was bailing out which I thought I didn't know if he was GNA actually do it we had a set up I was going to debate somebody

02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:48.159
an actual Christian very prominent Conservative Christian on the topic of

02:00:48.159 --> 02:00:54.679
was the Dark Ages actually dark of course I'm taking the opinion taking side of yes this person is giving G

02:00:54.679 --> 02:01:02.560
getting the side of no and which they actually have scholarship on their side so that I thought I'm giving you an easy

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:09.560
position to to fight me on he bailed out however before I before you talk crap

02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:14.679
about him he does he did agree to reschedule it to the 22nd so let's hold

02:01:14.679 --> 02:01:22.199
off on see if he actually shows up or not okay my guess that he won't but hey I might be wrong I hope I hope um that

02:01:22.199 --> 02:01:28.280
he will because uh this is a problem that I've been having is nobody wants to

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:34.040
step into the ring right I think it's I think it's cowardly I think it's really

02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:40.040
cowardly if you're willing to go out there on YouTube and and say anything

02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:46.599
about these texts and these religions um why why won't you talk to

02:01:46.599 --> 02:01:52.880
somebody uh who's got maybe some

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:58.400
evidence that you should look at right it's just SCI slam dunks they want the

02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:04.360
easy slam dunks they go on Tik Tok and they find that one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who wants to do

02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:10.360
like the make the dumbest claims in the world and then like slam dunk on this person the easiest loow hanging fruit in

02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:16.719
the world and then get all this praise for being this great public facing scholar that's refuting misinformation

02:02:16.719 --> 02:02:23.040
out there that nobody actually believes anyway so you're not it's like what do we do you're just what what's going this

02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:33.480
is this is what phds are doing in this day and age what what's going on yeah exactly and so their response to

02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:39.560
you I think I predict is going to be silence yeah that's another thing that's

02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:46.199
another thing if you want to actually engage in a real discussion bring with somebody who's actually serious about

02:02:46.199 --> 02:02:53.560
this who's actually going to the primary sources who's actually trying to be careful nope don't want to talk to you I

02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:59.400
can't that's like that's like the most mindblowing thing in the world supposed to be a public facing scholar and you

02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:04.480
actually have somebody with real criticisms of some of this stuff and here's your here's your opportunity to

02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:10.920
be to be the expert prove me wrong nope don't want to do it what does that tell

02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:16.520
you it's some there's some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on here there a lot of fake [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on with the scholars yeah yeah it

02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:23.400
makes me think that spreading the sources like you're doing is way more important important historically right

02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:29.159
now isn't that what a scholar supposed to do yeah yeah like a hundred years ago

02:03:29.159 --> 02:03:35.679
before the internet or even 50 years ago let's say the scholar was the the place you had to go to to find out about the

02:03:35.679 --> 02:03:41.639
ancient sources you couldn't there was no internet and you're not printing out books like they do today there's no

02:03:41.639 --> 02:03:48.920
Amazon you had to go to a library or you had to go to to a university and learn from an expert now now with the internet

02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:55.280
Scholars are almost being replaced because they're just off in their own little world writing academic papers for

02:03:55.280 --> 02:04:01.040
a few people not the general Public's not reading these really

02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:07.480
um specific topics of discussion and they're very Pol politicized it's very

02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:13.040
politically driven you can tell very politically driven there's no more it's

02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:20.159
it's not the same as it used to be and I'm only saying this as somebody who's who reads modern scholarship and reads

02:04:20.159 --> 02:04:25.239
older Scholars I read both I read James Frasier and you're like oh my God the

02:04:25.239 --> 02:04:32.679
wealth of knowledge this guy has Ricky he's like an encyclopedia of the ancient world just going into Syria going into

02:04:32.679 --> 02:04:37.960
Phoenicia going into Egypt and writing about all these different gods in their in their Cults and then today it's like

02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:44.639
every scholar you talk to is sort of relegated into this one little specific area and there's not a lot of big

02:04:44.639 --> 02:04:53.000
anthropologic anthropology uh driven um I mean

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:58.239
books I guess I don't know there are some I'm not saying there isn't like you know obviously there's there's some

02:04:58.239 --> 02:05:05.400
really good textbooks out there but I'm just saying for the most part that's what it seems to be the the Mania is bad

02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:12.040
enough in modern Academia and I can only speak for Classics but the Mania is bad

02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:19.639
enough um that they aren't doing their job they're not really guarding the

02:05:19.639 --> 02:05:26.360
reason you're guarding those sources is for um the bigger uh benefit to

02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:32.800
society right that's what you you they're not just nerds who are sitting around looking at books they're supposed

02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:38.960
to be nerds who are making sure the public has access to this information so

02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:47.159
that we can maintain without filtering it without filtering it through their own biases but that doesn't make careers

02:05:47.159 --> 02:05:53.559
it you got to go through the biases you gotta go through the silly articles you got to go and I'm telling you from

02:05:53.559 --> 02:05:58.719
experience in hundreds hundreds of meetings through my 20

02:05:58.719 --> 02:06:06.599
years uh of Education alone I can tell you right I can tell you that this

02:06:06.599 --> 02:06:13.040
process is meant to prop people up and it does and you have to become political

02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:20.360
and you have to say x y z and if you say the wrong thing you can get fired I'm I'm the perfect example of that right

02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:26.199
and once you're out you're outout so all of the academics Neil that you will

02:06:26.199 --> 02:06:32.079
encounter at heart are scared right they're SC they're scared of losing

02:06:32.079 --> 02:06:37.599
their jobs noticed that's what I've noticed yeah so they can't come out and

02:06:37.599 --> 02:06:45.800
say such you know um such stuff you know uh I was I wanted to ask you um as you

02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:51.239
open up this Gateway because what it is is a gateway to the to the past that we

02:06:51.239 --> 02:06:56.480
have haven't been privy to up to this point um as you open up this Gateway are

02:06:56.480 --> 02:07:02.920
you in uh in are you finding like an even more interesting history isn't it

02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:09.800
cool when you look back at what the people are actually doing and you're like wow that's you know it's way more

02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:15.520
interesting than this monest fairy tale I got growing up you know in

02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:21.840
America yeah like I said before I'll say it again the world before the church was

02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:28.480
colorful and three-dimensional and and then all of a sudden it just became dark and

02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:33.559
two-dimensional that's what that's I think it's the best way to describe it and then people want to talk about oh

02:07:33.559 --> 02:07:40.520
the Dark Ages wasn't really so dark you know the ostrogoths were actually pretty cool they built these great churches

02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:46.480
they and they they struck look at this golden Monument they built I don't care about none of that I don't even care if

02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:51.880
the economy was great which it wasn't by the way I'm finding that out right now it actually wasn't that great it was

02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:57.239
only good if you were like living in the top 1% and you like a royal whatever but

02:07:57.239 --> 02:08:04.719
anyways let's not even talk about the E economy or whatever I'm talking about text talking about literature talking

02:08:04.719 --> 02:08:11.400
about things that make the world fun things that make you want to get up in the in the morning architect or yeah

02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:20.079
architecture being one uh theater play writers poetry books about history where

02:08:20.079 --> 02:08:25.360
what happened to all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it goes away it it gets killed because

02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:32.440
everything's directed at this one purpose the church the Trinity Mother

02:08:33.159 --> 02:08:38.520
Mary and that's the world you're forced into the the the fact that people are

02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:44.239
studying this stuff and still want to slap that label on themselves is

02:08:44.239 --> 02:08:51.239
mindblowing it speaks volumes about a person that you know this history and you still want to slap that label on you

02:08:51.239 --> 02:08:56.440
that you're and then and then like try to act like some sort of progressive

02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:01.639
version of that no no no there's some fake [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on there I can see right through

02:09:01.639 --> 02:09:09.599
it fake I love that I'm gonna I'm gonna quote you on that somay there's some fake [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on there right right all

02:09:09.599 --> 02:09:14.920
right and um the more you peel back the more you look at those sources isn't it

02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:21.800
amazing how the stuff just kind of fills in and you begin to see this picture

02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:27.760
when you've read so of these voices of antiquity you

02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:33.679
start to get a real kind of authentic feel every once in a while just to

02:09:33.679 --> 02:09:40.239
inspire my audience who is going through the process of learning these sources

02:09:40.239 --> 02:09:48.320
Neil tell us um it gets to a point where you you can see it so well that it it

02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:54.480
kind of makes you high doesn't it yeah you're right there's a buzz that

02:09:54.480 --> 02:10:00.159
you get from digging into these text and uh and trying to understand what was the

02:10:00.159 --> 02:10:05.280
mindset like of people in those days compared to recently or in the Middle

02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:10.480
Ages or something like that and you're right there's a buzz that you get from reading these people it's a different

02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:16.840
world totally totally different world back then yeah and you can bring that to people you can bring that to them

02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:23.520
through the language and through the sources so I think we're doing essentially what the Moder what the

02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:30.280
ancient Museum would be doing right you're you're like a librarian if you're living in Alexandria you'd be working

02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:35.520
for the library you know what I mean cataloging or something getting that

02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:41.040
preserving that stuff I love it I love it you know it's preservation real quick

02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:46.199
I just want to say something on that it's amazing how many texts that are

02:10:46.199 --> 02:10:51.800
cited and quoted by ancient ancients like plutar or diodorus or or whatever

02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:57.280
uh appus uh Lucian cites all these texts and they're all citing the same sources

02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:03.280
like Lucian knows a lot of the same sources that plutar knows yeah uh penius knows a lot of the same sources heus

02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:09.280
Vere is one of them right they're all talking about this heus Vere guy but then all of a sudden they lose all these

02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:14.880
texts after the fourth Century it almost makes you wonder like what what how do

02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:22.000
how did they just lose the what was going on in these libraries that they lost all these precious materials

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:29.480
that we now don't even know what they said we have to go through through um we have to go through fragments of other

02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:34.559
taxs to find these find these TXS it's it's it's terrible it's almost like they

02:11:34.559 --> 02:11:41.079
history was is almost lost G gayen was complaining about

02:11:41.079 --> 02:11:47.840
Christians burning down libraries so I think it's I think it was intentional I

02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:53.079
think that loss of information was monks who were us using classical text to wipe

02:11:53.079 --> 02:11:59.559
their backsides with um and you can see only the most famous

02:11:59.559 --> 02:12:05.199
survived and it's it's just Byzantine Scholars you know for everything that we

02:12:05.199 --> 02:12:13.920
say those Byzantine Scholars oh God the commentators like ts's oh God Michael

02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:20.719
CIS those guys they really did fight to preserve that they saved Humanity they

02:12:20.719 --> 02:12:27.280
saved they really did and the um yeah like you said like you got to

02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:33.159
think heus of ABA what did he say because we're talking about the oldest

02:12:33.159 --> 02:12:38.320
person to ever talk about Moses and Abraham and and I know he was welln

02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:46.199
because he's cited so often by plutar by Lucian by whoever panus mentions him so

02:12:46.199 --> 02:12:51.719
he's obviously wellknown he wasn't like some rare text they obvious could have

02:12:51.719 --> 02:12:57.520
preserved him he was obviously that volumous at the time what did he say that the church didn't want to preserve

02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:03.679
what was he saying I bet you there's some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in there that they didn't want to keep and not only do they do they do

02:13:03.679 --> 02:13:10.599
they get did they lose txt that they didn't want to preserve they messed with text that they wanted to change like

02:13:10.599 --> 02:13:17.079
Josephus interpolating Josephus to put Jesus in there like that's they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

02:13:17.079 --> 02:13:22.280
with our history and people just people just think it's okay yeah it's not

02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:27.960
normal C for us you couldn't do that for us today you can't fake those I mean you

02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:35.400
can't like like you know fake digital you'll lose your career you're done that would be that's horrible to do

02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:41.199
that but um we have all of those sources

02:13:41.199 --> 02:13:47.639
all we need to do all we need to do is go back to those sources and when you start reading that stuff you're doesn't

02:13:47.639 --> 02:13:56.599
it I'm telling you it's a drug it's a complete drug when they we talked about inspiration tonight um those forms of

02:13:56.599 --> 02:14:02.880
inspiration or Mania the doctors on the side of gayen were talking about those

02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:10.159
types of mania and how they can be controlled with drugs part of your psychological well-being is your

02:14:10.159 --> 02:14:15.760
balancing and that balancing comes through drugs as if the you know

02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:21.920
Humanity was meant to have a constant supply of this natural stuff

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:28.679
um and it's all in Galen so when we talk about Madness and The Madness of the poet and all that kind of stuff that

02:14:28.679 --> 02:14:35.239
gift that gift is just an adjustment of your interaction with nature right they

02:14:35.239 --> 02:14:40.639
can breathe those mephitic vapers they can chew those leaves they can have

02:14:40.639 --> 02:14:46.199
those snakes that they're milking they can use all of these chemicals but it

02:14:46.199 --> 02:14:54.119
comes down to a process of very physical you know you know um real process and

02:14:54.119 --> 02:14:59.159
that process was called the mystery and that's all we're doing is showing using

02:14:59.159 --> 02:15:04.440
these sources to show you I thought what you did tonight you know with Yao I thought that was gorgeous thank you for

02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:12.040
bringing in the little the manuscript that had the little EO and it's like dude seriously look at it there it is

02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:18.280
you cannot deny that right there's no Miracle there you're just working with

02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:23.599
evidence hardcore evidence so I love that and I hope that it doesn't cause

02:15:23.599 --> 02:15:30.520
you problems to be associated with what did you think about the Osiris thing no

02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:36.280
I think it's yeah I think it's because the name the name o o o oion in Greek is

02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:42.960
Holy One and then sasus has the same name in Fran there's even there's even a

02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:51.159
goddess called HOSA and she ultimately it comes into Greek ultimately as AA did

02:15:51.159 --> 02:15:57.199
something with the vowels so yeah it is this holy Divinity and what I like about

02:15:57.199 --> 02:16:04.599
Aisa is that she is um like supposed to be old old old like before Olympian

02:16:04.599 --> 02:16:12.880
before anything you're seeing in in he see it she's supposed to come back from then so she's this like goddess of

02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:18.719
Justice right she turns out to be very much like um themus very like and thank

02:16:18.719 --> 02:16:25.520
you for mentioning thesmophoria and all that kind of stuff like that people think the laws were given you know

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:31.239
here's Western Civilization law was given by Moses he's looking into the burning bush he's getting all high and

02:16:31.239 --> 02:16:38.359
he's bringing down stone tablets and saying don't do this that's where the law comes from bull that's a third

02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:46.319
Century story right you already have legal precedent already in Greece just through

02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:53.040
this agency right of oracles all that kind of stuff um their God is the God of

02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:59.478
Justice right hello right the oric him to Misa because there's a there's a

02:16:59.479 --> 02:17:08.478
female version of dionis in the orphic hymns called Misa and the orphic hymn to Misa calls her dionis the lawgiver and

02:17:08.479 --> 02:17:15.120
everyone wants to say pagans were all all Lawless and just going around having origies no they were as a civilized

02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:21.598
world where they took the law very seriously that's how democracy works with the law

02:17:21.599 --> 02:17:27.960
thoria let me ask you a Bible question before I forget um when in the in the

02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:33.920
Acts of the Apostles there when Paul is doing his thing and those um it says

02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:39.280
those seven sons of the high priest uh the Judean high priest went into the

02:17:39.281 --> 02:17:46.359
house with the guy and he had a bad spirit and they all come running out he says look this is not how Jesus did it

02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:51.760
it's not how Paul did it and they all come out running out naked I wanted to

02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:58.240
add I want I wanted to get your comments on that but I wanted to add that um it I

02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:03.359
think it's reasonable to assume that if you have seven men in a house and they

02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:09.800
all run out naked at the same time they weren't probably dressed and then had

02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:15.478
their clothes ripped off by this demon possessed guy more likely that they were

02:18:15.479 --> 02:18:21.399
there naked and he was like no no this is not how Paul you're using sense and

02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:29.120
logic to figure out what we can't know it's true it makes me wonder why do you think

02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:34.399
he was so mad and beat him up was it because it was seven of them and that's

02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:40.719
not what Paul did is that I don't know what do you think I don't

02:18:40.719 --> 02:18:45.880
know why is it why was he so mad I don't know

02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:51.880
um but a by the way a lot of those other apocryphal every we we you and I have

02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:59.040
both looked at these apocryphal early Christian second century texts there's some weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on like you have

02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:06.200
stories about Mary being a child being given over to Joseph as a as like a child bride no one talks about that but

02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:12.120
that was that was basically canonized from what I've understood that was like understood to be like the truth about

02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:18.120
Mary be being given over to Joseph as a child bride and every all these Christians want to talk crap about

02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:23.280
Muslims and saying oh Muhammad had a child Bri so did so did [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Joseph

02:19:23.281 --> 02:19:29.319
so I don't know what's going on what do you what are your thoughts on that about Paul by the way I think the the

02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:36.040
apocryphal text that says that um this the Midwife came into Mary and palpated

02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:42.518
her and her fingers uh she pulled her fingers out because um they were burning

02:19:42.519 --> 02:19:47.719
and I think that kind of anthropological evidence I think that's

02:19:47.719 --> 02:19:53.800
the most valuable right I think when you get down to the dirt right that's like

02:19:53.800 --> 02:20:00.319
archaeology that's like literary archaeology there that's why I take that's why I take EP um epiphanous and

02:20:00.319 --> 02:20:07.160
hpus and irus so seriously because you're getting you're getting an A View

02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:13.080
you're getting a little window in the things that you're not supposed to know about those are the dirty sources that

02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:20.080
supposed to be forgotten about okay what about speaking of dirty speaking of dirty sources what is your opinion on

02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:25.160
Jesus going up into the mountains with Mary alone and pulling her out of his

02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:30.359
side and then ejaculating after self-pleasuring and telling her she has

02:20:30.359 --> 02:20:39.399
to eat it or they're gonna die I think what you're getting from epiphanous and by the way real quick epiphanius was a

02:20:39.399 --> 02:20:48.080
encyclopedist so he if you read epiphanius Works he's got sources that go back he's got a lot epiphanius wrote

02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:53.680
almost as much as Plutarch probably wrote we're talking books upon books upon books upon books he was just

02:20:53.680 --> 02:21:01.640
writing every day of his life he wrote a lot he had a lot of sources he was citing a lot of ancient text so when he

02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:08.920
tells us about a sect of Christianity that existed in the first century that had these spe certain gospels about Mary

02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:15.439
that have Jesus going on the mountain and splitting himself in a half the way that you get with like Adam and Eve it's

02:21:15.439 --> 02:21:21.240
part of the mystery like you mentioned the diad the monad rips into a diad and splits off

02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:26.720
right that's what it's supposed to be that's what it's representing that to me sounds like an early Ripple of

02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:32.479
Christianity that they tried to distance themselves from that's what I think is going on but

02:21:32.479 --> 02:21:39.960
I think what you're getting in that text is not some random heretical offshoot it's early Christianity

02:21:39.960 --> 02:21:45.280
itself why is it that eating Jesus's

02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:52.521
Sean is g to give Mary life why do you think Jesus was insisting on that

02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:57.800
because that's that's that's the that's the I

02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:04.160
want to say it's the mystery but it's like a Corruption of the mystery because you would eat dianis at at the eloian

02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:11.479
Mysteries you would take part in drinking the Kon that had the blood of dianis in the in the body of Deiter the

02:22:11.479 --> 02:22:19.040
the beer what if you so they're just doing their own version of that in Christ and by the way that just like the

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:24.160
lamb replaces the bow it's mystery talk M it's it's the we're

02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:31.600
talking about language that is would be very noticeable to any any Greeks living

02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:39.720
in that time period what about this the Seaman I really want to

02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:47.840
dwell on this point I really want to dwell on this point what about the Sean is going to be giving life it is it is

02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:54.080
his Essence that is giving life if we know that they're

02:22:54.080 --> 02:23:00.479
using seman in rights number one and we know in Christian rights and we know

02:23:00.479 --> 02:23:04.880
that they're using semen in

02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:12.399
medicine could the use could could Jesus's I'm just trying to get in Jesus's mind if I were standing there

02:23:12.399 --> 02:23:20.000
and we had gone to this private place like you said and you know there she is and all of a sudden I start spanking and

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:27.439
then I tell her you've got to eat this or you're going to die um I'm only going

02:23:27.439 --> 02:23:32.960
to do that if I know there's something in that

02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:38.800
seen ready for this that's gonna counteract what she's got I mean when I

02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:44.439
saw the first time I saw two Roman soldiers piss into each other's mouth

02:23:44.439 --> 02:23:49.479
right um I thought okay okay I get it I knew gayin was

02:23:49.479 --> 02:23:54.560
drinking the urine all time time but okay I get it um is there something in

02:23:54.560 --> 02:24:01.240
Jesus's Sean is this holy Sean I gotta share my screen real quick that I got

02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:07.760
down there so it's this is from John's gospel this is not some apocryphal text

02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:16.479
in John 6 he says it he says anyone eaten of this bread he

02:24:16.479 --> 02:24:23.640
will live and then he says I will give my

02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:29.359
SARS that word SARS could be either blood or semen

02:24:29.359 --> 02:24:37.399
right it's gonna be no the SARS is going to be Flash and the um the seamen uh

02:24:37.399 --> 02:24:45.439
going to be the haa in Greek originally haa does just mean any body fluid that is your essence

02:24:45.439 --> 02:24:54.080
but it comes to mean blood so yeah okay h yeah yeah so yummy yummy

02:24:54.080 --> 02:25:00.439
flesh The Taste flesh yeah whoever eats the haa whoever drinks the haa and eats

02:25:00.439 --> 02:25:08.000
the SARS gets to be Zoey yeah and that's what he's talking about when he splits himself off you see how it all comes

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:15.640
back cir full circle when you the the the the female that splits off from the male is Zoe he's basically saying you

02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:23.399
could be Zoey too eat my Zoey that's what he's doing yeah isn't that right it's crazy but

02:25:23.399 --> 02:25:30.279
it's it's kind of wait a minute wait a minute so we've got two factions tell me if this is right we have ton we have

02:25:30.279 --> 02:25:39.520
tons of factions but we've got two kind of sides we've got the people like the of fites and Jesus who is into Seaman

02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:45.080
consumption right then we've got the people who are saying no no no we gotta

02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:52.359
stop we gotta stop doing that um is this the biggest problem of Christianity and

02:25:52.359 --> 02:26:00.120
its in its seminal form and its earliest form problem are they trying to sort out

02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:06.399
the the whole sexuality of the mystery I don't know that's what I think is going on I think early early in the early

02:26:06.399 --> 02:26:12.600
Christian days you had a lot more deeper darker mysterious things going on and as

02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:19.160
it starts to popularize just like any other thing in the world it becomes corporatized and then it becomes oh we

02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:26.240
got to make it PG-13 you can't have it rated out anymore so then they start distancing themselves from their ancient

02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:32.800
the real the real pioneers of the religion Christianity that's what I think you're seeing that's why I think

02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:38.840
these these these uh ref reput tators were so important the irenaeus hippius

02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:46.600
epiphanius Justin Martyr because they had it was their job to cut off cut off

02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:53.240
their roots and basically distance them themselves from their own

02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:59.040
past it's a it's a shame now what took you um what did you have to do to get to

02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:05.120
this point that you understand that because you know most people don't understand that what you just said how

02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:10.439
did you get to that point just tell everybody real quick how did you get to that point well because you don't have

02:27:10.439 --> 02:27:16.160
any other sources besides those you have a black hole in the first

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:21.800
century black hole besides Paul and the Gospels there's nothing else but then

02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:26.880
you start reading the reputat and they go oh oh this guy uh his name is

02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:34.399
saturnus he lived in the first century he was a heretic oh this guy Justin or this guy um basil he lived in the first

02:27:34.399 --> 02:27:39.520
century he was a heretic oh this guy Liv in the second century he was a heretic wait so who is not the

02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:46.359
Heretics there's only all we have a bunch of Heretics and then you guys living in the second century and then

02:27:46.359 --> 02:27:54.319
all of a sudden it's like oh where's Paul's writings at you got those okay what about Peter what about James what

02:27:54.319 --> 02:28:00.160
about oh we lost all their stuff so all we have are Heretics Paul in the gospels

02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:07.359
in the first century and uh Clement of Alex Clement of Rome and

02:28:07.359 --> 02:28:14.840
$50,000 worth of Magic books in one little village right

02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:20.120
$50,000 in Magic books and that's what that's what I'm saying like all EX

02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:26.920
exactly then we finally discover text and what do we find we find the heresy

02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:32.000
stuff they go in they go to nagamati oh we found ancient Christian documents oh

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:37.120
what are they gonna say is it going to be on the Trinity is it going to be something that that that promotes Paul's

02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:43.479
writings there be something that promotes uh Justin nope heresy heresy heresy heresy heresy so it's like what

02:28:43.479 --> 02:28:48.840
else do we have what you have nothing else but heresy that makes me think that

02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:53.920
the heresy was the real Christianity it's just very

02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:59.800
simple yeah we have a duty I love it we have a duty to keep this stuff out in

02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:05.080
the public and to let people know for for Humanity to know because you're

02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:11.000
painting a very different picture and but what it does is it does you're

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.520
getting you're creating right now the type of comments that I get which is oh

02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:23.319
now it makes sense I never I always thought something was wrong you can actually see from what you're doing with

02:29:23.319 --> 02:29:29.040
the sources you can kind of shine light on what the movements in Christianity

02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:35.680
were and how they took over and destroyed classical civilization and

02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:41.479
that's classical civilization had to Bubble Up over time in the Renaissance

02:29:41.479 --> 02:29:48.600
Enlightenment right oh God I love it it's a long line man I I uh my hats off

02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:54.359
to you for being one of those documentarians people remember they will

02:29:54.359 --> 02:30:01.960
burn statues of Gnostic informant right they'll they will uh burn him in apigy

02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:08.479
and then they'll 400 years later they'll burn him in uh into bronze they'll make

02:30:08.479 --> 02:30:14.800
a statue of him and they'll say this guy this guy was good which we always do

02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:20.240
first of all you they always demonize the dude who comes up with something

02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:27.000
knew right they always demonize that person and then it takes them a couple of centuries and enough people do enough

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:33.680
work on what that person was doing that they realized oh that person was actually right you know what Bruno was

02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:39.800
saying Bruno was saying there's other planets out there right un innumerable

02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:48.479
