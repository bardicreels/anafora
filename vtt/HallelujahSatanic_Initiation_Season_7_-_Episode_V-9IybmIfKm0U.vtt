00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:46.759
the painkillers so okay did everybody did everybody get the okay we're good to go okay I just want you to notice the

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:54.520

about don't you get that wrong either we come here to worship Bas at this time in history we come here

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.760
to honor the Son of God the reason that we have all of the

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.560
problems is because people will not Embrace that he is the Son of

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:54.480
God yes prove it bacas prove it okay I'm starting to Can You Feel Can You Feel

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:01.240

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:39.000
Zeus he Bears the cup what does that mean well that's on two levels people okay

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.480
and we know it because you and I you know did you see that Roman hitchhiker we picked up few weeks ago who's been on

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:53.839
time spaceship yeah um he he's influencing us

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:59.160
subconsciously yeah and what he's doing is he's telling us look um we know what

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:07.079
the ganam is the ganam is the cup if you are following the pric poems which are

00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:13.279
old Roman poems hymns and whatnot little

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:20.160
diddies epigrams all sorts of stuff man preg and what do they say in the preg

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:31.440
gamed has the anal cup yes Zeus drinks from G animed and

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.720
heie heie did you just say heie I did do

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:44.519
we have picture fantastic heie notice notice she looks like she may be young

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:50.680
it's because youth youth is what her name means okay remember we worship the

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:57.160
gods we're not like Christians and Jews we do not become monists and worship one

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:03.920
force at the expense of all the the others we worship youth in Antiquity hey

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.200
who doesn't want to be young who doesn't want to be young do you know the Son of

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.760
God who's the son of God Mary you guys don't know it you don't know who the Son

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:22.320
of God marries it's heie it's Youth and what is what does heie do

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:29.600
youth gives Ambrosia to the Olympians she's the

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:36.399
source of Olympian Ambrosia what is ambrosia what are Ambrosia a nectar

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:41.720
right cuz ganam is trumping around with the nectar he's got that

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:47.360
nectar right and youth what she's got the Ambrosia what is she doing if she

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:54.399
doesn't give us that we don't live forever you mean that's what the Greeks

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:59.560
thought yes let me say this to you and I want you to use everything

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:07.680
practiced up until this point mentally mentally if you

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:15.240
don't feed the gods Ambrosia and nectar they

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.560
die they become immort they become mortal their

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:27.959
mortality is burned off by their own eor

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:33.240
and what is eor that is what flows in your veins that's

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:39.560
what media removed from Taos yeah

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:45.360
yeah and if you don't have it from HEI and ganam you don't have your mortality

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:51.000
burned off yeah did you think that the yeah

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.320
right it's a system has to work according to the laws of

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:03.160
physics right okay I get it let's get very rational stuff people it's not you

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:11.040

side way over here right

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:41.519
here and that's a that's a funny for you Greek people the my students that's the

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:46.880
archaic right that's that's an old genitive any who look they don't have to

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:54.880
be right next to each other then I got no problem with that what is this thing full of right it's full of this wine

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.199
you're going to be involved in this you're going to be involved the oysters up front and everybody here knows what

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:10.279
the gadfly does the gadfly stings you and makes you mad he makes you

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:18.120
crazy he makes you want to pursue kicks your mind into a place of

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:24.759
mania that is unsatisfiable

00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:30.880
insatiable oh God she's giving it to him who is daughter instead of the milk

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:36.360
that's what it says under it let's go let's go and what happens look look look

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:44.360
look speak up speak up old man where'd you find the nectar of Olympus on Earth

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:51.480
where'd you find it where'd you get it you didn't get it from keesus

00:15:53.720 --> 00:16:00.959
thisan look at that what is does that mean it means the

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:07.920
color of santhos santhos what is the stuff you

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:14.399
thought what is this stuff I'm gonna assume it's wine this isn't the origin of wine

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:20.839
making this is the origin of bacus take a look at the next next we're

00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:26.480
going to get a I think it's this one is that yep sanos people now we have a

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:35.199
problem take it down we have a problem and put it right buckle up when I say we have a problem with colors in Antiquity

00:16:35.199 --> 00:16:40.560
you would think in Greek that there would be a red and a blue maybe a green

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:46.399
and a yellow everything's going to be fine yeah well you discover there's a

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:51.880
huge problem when you start studying medicine because every color fluid that

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.959
comes out of the body must be described these are all symptoms yeah was he

00:16:56.959 --> 00:17:04.160
flagma was it like right was he billias right so you have to know these

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.839
colors and they're weird and they can vary and every time you have one you got to think I bet this could be a couple

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:16.400
other colors so here's our option people of the color yellow various shades with

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.839
a tinge of red brown or Auburn perhaps all the way to a brown

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:30.000
through an Auburn um golden people Sant is golden

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.799
it's like yellow with a touch of blood with just a touch of blood but look we

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:44.200
know certain people are known for their nice blonde hair their nice blonde hair

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:50.640
and there's even a wine here in this list look look at paragraph number two we got an aphrodisiac

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:57.000
wine there is that golden golden you want some golden stuff

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.919
here you know what killy's hair was colored it was golden you know what

00:18:02.919 --> 00:18:09.240
media's hair was colored it was color of radiating

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:18.240
Sun nice nice That's the color we've got here and that's the color of the HUD the

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.880
solution that bakas has given people and let's see what it does okay so first we

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.679
already got the painkillers at the door right now what do we doing right

00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:35.559

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:19.399
Maniacs into one

00:27:19.399 --> 00:27:26.120
machine and they will turn on aarius and they will kill

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:34.240
him to together they will understand why his death is necessary and they will

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:41.039
kill him in their Mania and there's a very graphic description of them doing this and now here's where you start

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:47.919
feeling a little regretful right they kill him they pound him with their fists

00:27:47.919 --> 00:27:56.159
they bludgeon him yeah and um then they start with a cudel and ating him it's

00:27:56.159 --> 00:28:02.519
got a spike on it a thorn and they start a rating him and the blood is splashing

00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:08.679

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:39.800
last time Jesus going through the cathartic

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:47.760
rituals didn't we show you his magic that he's doing yeah this is the extension of that

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:53.119
this is the performance of the mystery you go back to that verse one more time

00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:59.319
the same one I just want you to notice people death will not

00:42:59.319 --> 00:43:05.800
exist death will not exist remember what we said those of the second

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:13.800
death what do we do what do we do in those days we are going to be stuck because

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:21.599
we're going to be searching for death but death is not going to

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:27.079
come right why because the mystery will have been rest

00:43:27.079 --> 00:43:32.680
started you know the mystery is that

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:40.680
salvation from Death yeah yeah you didn't thank Jesus

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:48.079
and the resurrections were all just symbolic right right yeah realize the

00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:54.240
physics that's there right you you evangelicals may be able

00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:00.760
to pull out enough common sense to respect what I'm

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:06.400
saying yeah let's go let's go to the next one um look what's going to happen

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:12.839
there will be no death I just want you guys to see it right why because we've restarted the mystery and what does the

00:44:12.839 --> 00:44:19.640
mystery do the mystery averts death how does the mystery do that by submerging

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:27.200
you in that Transit yeah right

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:33.520
right into that black hole love it it's going to open your eyes right Jehovah

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:39.040
was trying to do that from the start what do you think Eve was for you got to have the Water of Life if you want to

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:47.000
take Adam your boy to the place where he goes beyond and comes back and has the

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.760
knowledge has the knowledge it's like a god it's like a god you know how you

00:44:53.760 --> 00:45:00.480
burn off somebody's mortality I wish we would start I wish we would

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:07.400

exception fearful fearful and what do we fear we

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:37.920
fear the Christ this language that you find in the New Testament is not

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:43.839
separate and distinct from the environment of the classical World Jesus

00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:50.119
did not suddenly appear within a

00:45:50.119 --> 00:45:57.400
vacuum yeah he is using the Machinery that is there at the time has anybody

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:04.000
noticed that we've been doing Greek the whole time that everything Jesus says is in Greek because they were not speaking

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.720
Hebrew yeah it was lurgical and it pissed people off but too bad languages

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:16.599

00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:02.240
with yeah yeah it has very good very good it's only the dogs that get

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:09.319
recognized right um give into your fear of Christ and right become that fear of

00:47:09.319 --> 00:47:14.960
pan keep going yeah and the women women by the way this is just a little bit I'm

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:21.760
just I'm taking Paul and I'm just causing him to cough up some things we're talking about marriage and whatnot

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:30.000
and cult and you know what if you are within the movement what is your opinion

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:37.520
right you got to obey your obey your men you know as if they were the cuos do you

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:44.839
hear me Eve do you hear me out there why is this Associated do you hear

00:47:44.839 --> 00:47:51.000
me Eve Eve didn't

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.079
listen that's what started the whole problem they had just written this thing in the third Cent Century so these new

00:47:57.079 --> 00:48:02.920
testament writers they're fresh on it right it's hand and glove it's good

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:12.640
stuff and you have to understand that that cuos um that Christos is that Adam and

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:18.400
I'm not the one saying this they're the ones saying this is the adom you mean

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:24.960
Judaism and Christianity or just two aspects of one single cult yes and that

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:30.359
cult came earlier and gave birth to Judaism and

00:48:30.359 --> 00:48:35.280
Christianity at a time when women were also

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:42.880
worshiped love it love it you're never GNA be able to hide those women Jehovah

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:49.000
keep going yeah next next quote please um this is Ephesians and Paul says in the

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:56.359
men love your wives you know is Christ is he Agape the Ecclesia the church

00:48:56.359 --> 00:49:02.960
right okay all right right all right good gave himself you know gave himself

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:10.119
put his all and might into it you know what I mean for the church because this is his bride come on man we defend him

00:49:10.119 --> 00:49:16.920
we defend the bride that's the way it is would you think this mystery didn't defend the bride look and what is all

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:24.920
this for it is for catharus it is for a cathartic cleansing

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:33.000
wait what am am I back in the bakic right yeah you are this is Christianity but it's bakic and what is all this for

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:40.240
what is Ephesians say right wh why does Jesus do all of this in order that he

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:47.359
may purify her right he may make her holy with a

00:49:47.359 --> 00:49:54.920
purification that is a bath it's a bath of water and how do we get there we get

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.520
there in the

00:50:00.359 --> 00:50:06.040
rmaa that's what we'll teach you that's what we'll teach you in the initiation

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:13.480
when we get there and we are ready to bring you there and back that's

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:19.599
what we'll use the RMA this is what we see in the Pye the

00:50:19.599 --> 00:50:28.720
Greek magical papiery this is what we see the use of these this this saying it's not it's not

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:35.640
really the same um it's this power that radiates that you use via the logos

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:41.559
which was in the beginning

00:50:41.559 --> 00:50:47.359
right you see you have to channel the right channel the right forces right or

00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:55.520
you're not going to be commanding demons it gets my goat when people try to command demons without understanding the

00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:01.760
physics because um the physics is image and if you don't have the right image

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:06.920
it's going to be useless I don't know why I mean it's like if you don't have wings you're not gonna fly bro it's that

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:12.280
simple let's go to the back to the source okay good and so this is that

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:18.119
cleansing that we need we are in cathartic rights with Jesus and bacas go

00:51:18.119 --> 00:51:23.680
back yep fantastic yeah um why is he

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:32.760
what's he going to do ultimately he's going to make make the his bride a thing of Honor right not having any spone or

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:41.960
r Wait She's Gotta She's Gotta she's got no spon and no R did did Eve have this

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:48.640
stuff did Eve have this no she didn't right because Jesus and Jehovah don't

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:55.839
pick anything but perfect virgins right are you come on people

00:51:55.839 --> 00:52:04.680
watch look what happens but she is AOS e is AOS at the bottom she is Not Without

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:09.880
Blame am the church has to be made Without

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:15.359
Blame why does Eve have the blame because she went through it and

00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:20.759
had her eyes opened and saw that God was

00:52:20.839 --> 00:52:27.960
nobody yeah isn't that amazing it brought her you thank the Garden of

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:35.400
Eden and the expulsion of Eve and her forced hard labor and childbirth because

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:42.240
he took away all our drugs you really think that Eve went down and got on her

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:47.440
knees and honored this Craton who threw her out sorry apologies to people to

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:55.599
Crate it's Mander and back to Media she's the one who said crans are all liars right sorry to Modern CED lovely

00:52:55.599 --> 00:53:04.920
place um gorgeous place um any who um this is what we have to this is what

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:11.960
we have to deal with um Eve's reputation she didn't lose it she gained

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:18.079
it what did what did God Jo or Jehovah

00:53:18.079 --> 00:53:25.280
what did that father God know he knew that if she got access to this fruit

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:31.319
from her own tree that she would be like

00:53:31.319 --> 00:53:37.960
him she wouldn't need him right when you get there take it down

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:44.559
for one second when you get there and you realize that you don't need

00:53:44.559 --> 00:53:50.480
him you know why he puts a guardian there right he puts a guardian who kept

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:59.000
that way the lightbringer kept that way Mr reason himself kept that

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:07.799
way he allowed her he allowed her to contravene the orders of the

00:54:07.799 --> 00:54:13.960
mongrel God who was with the boy Adam now when I

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:21.960
say Theos there hear from Antiquity hear from the Bronze Age Theos hear

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:29.000
it right m can you see him I can see him people say

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.640
don't make an image of Allah or God right don't make an

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:42.520
image I got one right here right here and it's not

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:49.520

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:17.119
Christ did what he loved you and gave himself for you for us right as a

00:55:17.119 --> 00:55:25.920

00:58:04.119 --> 00:58:09.960
pora you'll find that it is not only Temple worship but at the very same time

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:15.520
it is Temple sex it is acts that cause you to enter

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:21.640
into a sexual state right even if they're using Virgin

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:27.240
priestesses who are not de vinified to

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:34.599
retain their oracular power okay so there's still sexual acts

00:58:34.599 --> 00:58:41.319
going on in these rights all right all right now I

00:58:41.319 --> 00:58:48.200
promised you Moses would show up where is that guy come on Moses bring me those

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:55.319
keep going this the next one just do the next one yeah um yeah here's some translations you know no important no

00:58:55.319 --> 00:59:01.440

unclean person nor Covetous man right uh who happens to be an idolator that's a

00:59:12.079 --> 00:59:17.520
terrible translation King James sucks sometimes um keep going um New American

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:22.960
Standard which tends to be the most literal um impure person no immoral or

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:29.720
impure okay see how even there kind of brushing aside what that actual what

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:34.960
that actual Purity is talking about right we're talking about ganade there's

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:39.440
a reason that Zeus drinks from his

00:59:42.559 --> 00:59:49.359
rectum don't get upset at me it's in the pra right some British knight wrote a

00:59:49.359 --> 00:59:55.280
whole tretis on all of these aspects there's sodomy and what it was within

00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:01.760
the ritual um dildos there's all sorts of things that have to do with sexual

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:08.119
gratification and ritual because this is all under the umbrella of Lord

01:00:08.119 --> 01:00:14.160
priapus right now you didn't think would you be surprised if Jesus is standing in the place of

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:21.520
Prius oh now I understand the boys now I understand the boys that are with Jesus

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:29.599

01:02:22.279 --> 01:02:28.880
you to be ignorant of the fact Brothers that our fathers all of them um they

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.720
were underneath the influence of the cloud yeah and all of them came through

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:40.039
the sea through the midst of the sea yeah and all of them what all of them

01:02:40.039 --> 01:02:48.920
were baptized into Moses take it down baptized into Moses and the Orthodox

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:54.720
Jews in the group say well we don't care that's your new testament G garbage

01:02:54.720 --> 01:03:00.880
we don't care about that right it's fine you can put up that wall but you should

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:09.400
know you rabbis and Scholars of the Torah you should know that people in the

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:16.559
first century who were reading your septu are saying

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:23.440
Moses is a Baptist Moses is a Baptist you mean wait

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:29.559
a minute you mean all that funny snake stuff that Moses was doing and the snake on stick and all the healing yeah it's

01:03:29.559 --> 01:03:38.039
all Baptist you were baptized into Moses now originally what this concept

01:03:38.039 --> 01:03:44.520
was is you are submerged in the Muse

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:51.640
Musa but what it became was you were baptized into

01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:58.960
Moes it's no different people right every

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:07.359
religious Jew on the planet owes a debt of gratitude to the Greeks who

01:04:07.359 --> 01:04:14.160
established their oracular cult Moses would be nowhere without them and maybe

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:22.319
some priests maybe some Egyptian priests throw them in there right alexandrians yeah love it love it let's

01:04:22.319 --> 01:04:29.559
go to the next one isn't it nice to discover where you're where you're from right and and uh you know you can see

01:04:29.559 --> 01:04:36.839
that Christianity and Judaism were just variations of this very cult that we are talking about that we're trying to get a

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:42.920
straight up right um look at now what what what is I wanted you guys to see

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:49.160
this definition I should have used it earlier but this is what happens it's okay this is what happens when the bach

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:56.119
enters into the state that they can end up doing a thing that has the root PI

01:04:56.119 --> 01:05:04.400
right Pi P paos meaning child pzo right what am I going to do when I am

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:10.520
under the influence of the cult and I am in my

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:18.119
psychosis and I am seeing my two sons and I am sacrificing the children

01:05:18.119 --> 01:05:26.559
um what kind of mental Place do I get to I get to a place that I want to

01:05:26.559 --> 01:05:32.799
dance dance it is a place that I want to play just look at the definitions it's a

01:05:32.799 --> 01:05:39.640
place that I want to play on a musical instrument which they do for some reason

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:44.880
the music guides this group of Maniacs right and women are the ones who

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:51.279
pioneered this it's only late that men get involved right and that's part of why you have John the Baptist in Jesus

01:05:51.279 --> 01:05:56.680
Christ right cool so what um look what else does it mean number five play

01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:02.640
amorously what you mean so they use a word for playing amorously that uses the

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:09.680
root for child yeah sportive to be sportive like a child frolics them it's

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:17.400
like a you ever see a little deer jumping about young little young one jumping about right around around

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:23.839
mommy yeah that that sportive they used to use that word it's not really used

01:06:23.839 --> 01:06:30.319
any more but that kind of frolics them behavior is what they're the Bonet are

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:38.640
known for okay so take it down and I just want to give you the the big

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:43.960
picture within this right that we have just come to we are now in a state we

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:50.119
started out drinking some painkiller I felt a bit of pain um we entered

01:06:50.119 --> 01:06:57.319
into taking that gold it's filling our veins it's burning off

01:06:57.319 --> 01:07:03.640
our mortality and what do we do we offer up our children right we offer up our

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:10.920

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:59.000
gospel of Mark it's not what goes into you that corrupts you because Watch What Happens that stuff just goes through

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.799

nourished by Angels Mana is what they gave

01:09:13.239 --> 01:09:19.359
her okay here we go let's go back to Corinthians it's so creepy isn't it it's

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:25.400
like we're all of a sudden in a some kind of culty group or something

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:33.400

this migrant group right in the desert what do they do they're drinking

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:11.280
potions they're eating Brahma and what else there's a

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:16.600
rock there's a rock with them wait a minute you mean the bride has to be

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:23.880
around that rock yes that's the Greek that I showed you that rock goes with

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:29.080
the process of the mystery are the Jews performing the mystery yes are the

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:36.440
Christians performing the mystery some of them right fantastic the rock is there one

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:43.360
more time one more time oh let's just go okay um yeah and somehow they end up

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:49.560
getting extruded Into the Wilderness but anyhow um things go bad and God gets mad

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:55.040
and people die and um these things are there for example EX for you people so

01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:00.080
you might know not to have these you know Tendencies to be able to go into

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:07.159
this process of using these drugs and becoming born again you have a you're

01:11:07.159 --> 01:11:13.560
gonna have to stop doing this right there has to be a a a real SCA here

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:19.520
there has to be a limiting tent where we can go a limiting tent

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:25.640
where we can all go right there's got to be a place h Jesus in the

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:32.320
temple right he's reestablishing he's taking over the bakic tradition one more

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:38.480
time with that verse I just want to see if there's anything there at the bottom yeah so there's a lot of poring I just

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:45.760
want you to see at the bottom there's a lot of porating right and a lot of people get killed for the porn Nation now you can

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:52.120
follow the fairy tale and you can say something like the ground opened up and swallowed them or you can say there was

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:57.239
a fery of death that came came down and caused everybody I like that one I like

01:11:57.239 --> 01:12:06.760
the fery of death yeah it's fun I read that to my children at night it's bedtime story um the angel of

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:13.040
death what a terrible job okay but um what happens what happens um these

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:18.560
people are porating right and that's what's the wrecking the problem that's why

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:26.080
thousands of them are killed how many thousands a lot of thousands several thousand

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.679
right okay take it out of here

01:12:31.679 --> 01:12:38.159
Moses is presented by the author of this epistle if it's Paul or whoever who

01:12:38.159 --> 01:12:45.440
cares um the the I don't care if it was the actual junkie I know they trust this one but I if it was the actual junkie

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.480
Paul or not Paul knows The Thorn In the Flesh he knows this so he knows that

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:56.159
when Moses goes out and he's with his people and he's getting ready to build

01:12:56.159 --> 01:13:03.560
that SK so that he can have that one right so that he can control the Oracle

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:09.400
because if everybody's doing it gives us no power why do you think

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:14.679
people in elus kept it secret why do you think their priesthood kept it secret

01:13:14.679 --> 01:13:21.239
because people went every year to elus to be able to have this lifechanging

01:13:21.239 --> 01:13:27.480
experience right it was keeping the territory they were guarding the

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:35.520
territory and Baka says in this text he says hey this isn't that cup that Athena

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:43.719
gave you this isn't that this is the gold of bakus right you're about to go there

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:51.480
this is the right that Christianity emerges from makes changes

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:57.320
to and then perpetu situates with its own

01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:04.560
bastardization of the right now the early church fathers messed up and had

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:10.840
them remove the drugs from the right and as Christianity came to power

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:18.480
in Rome and as they found their Trump in Constantine they found access to that

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:26.719
power they then regulated all of the experience that you

01:14:26.719 --> 01:14:33.120
would get from the use of a drug I.E idolatry they regulate haven't you ever

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:40.080
wondered why modern evangelicalism and Nancy Reagan go hand inand haven't you

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.960
ever wondered why people just say no and why it's a you know a good a good

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:51.080
religious person doesn't do drugs haven't you ever wondered that that is

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:56.800
the mechanism of a people who lived in the third and fourth centuries trying to

01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:02.880
get you to have your access cut

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:09.840
off so much so that now we don't even have the concept of the drug communion

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:17.600
we don't even have the concept of it anymore we're having to ReDiscover it we're having to ReDiscover it yeah I

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:23.679
want you to be happy tonight knowing that all of the religions that are

01:15:23.679 --> 01:15:29.880
around you that you're hearing that you're feeling the ones that are prop propelling you

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:35.800
forward um those religions have an

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:40.840
anchor in history this is where we're from people

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:47.040
we're from this right it was this mystery that

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:52.400
forged Western Civilization it was this mystery that

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:58.080
creeped across Ross the Atlantic all right on some ships and

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:07.360
ended up with you and I celebrating Thanksgiving a holiday that Thomas Jefferson said should never have been a

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:14.719
holiday never should the government have supported a holiday that was a religious

01:16:14.719 --> 01:16:20.639
holiday why because everybody knows from history as soon as they take over as

01:16:20.639 --> 01:16:28.840
soon as you have a man woman or child in a Christian office you will

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:34.960
lose your democracy you will lose the voice of the people you will lose the

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:40.280
golden age that you've managed to bring to the world and if you doubt me the

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:46.040
last thousand years will show it have you seen the sacrifice have you seen the

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:52.400
