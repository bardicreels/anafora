00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.600
me the opening shot um yeah this is for me on top of the devil's work this is

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.280
Ides I just wanted you to have it everybody tune in you know what he said

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.960
in the herac ey you know what he said he's talking through the mouth of Yola

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.600
and who is Yola Yola is The Shepherd of the children of Heracles why because

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.240
Heracles is dead and so somebody needs to be in that place to the parent yes so

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.720
that's what we've got and what does he say he says you know I learned a long time ago that there's two types of people

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.960
there's the just person who is a benefit to his neighbor and then there is the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:24.919
person who's interested in profit that person is not useful to the

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.199
city and they're only looking out for their own best interest they're very

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:39.039
hard to be around take it down that coming from the stage of

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:45.199
purification where the Athenian democracy maintained its Integrity you

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:54.080
thought as Americans you thought you could just sit back no no no no no it's an active art to maintain that flame to

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.600
maintain that Democratic power is an active art yes it it is fantastic do you

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.000
see what's coming out of their play rights right are you out for profit now I'm speaking to those of you who are out

propers you worship them you love them you give them your

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:31.280
heart because you're thinking they're going to do something for you it's why you accepted Jesus Christ I know it is

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.720
I used to um I used to save people I used to save people that's a

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.319
real art right but if you don't have that thing that you're grasping for that

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.479
little bit of profit is it eternal life is it eternal

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:54.000
life is that your Prophet is that your Prophet eternal

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.360

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:48.880
science I'm calling it Dragon because they called it Dragon it's a language

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.880
it's a language and we have a written form of it that's expressed and we can't translate it it's in thing called the

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.880
Greek magical papy you can find it there you can find it there it's gorgeousness

00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:22.720
gonna here's what I'm going to tell you from the book of the Apocalypse right all you Christians pay attention

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.399
remember I told you last week the guy who wrote the series um coming back or

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:36.040
staying away or what whatever it was yeah due to its lack of accuracy the devil has put him on a special list a

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.800
special list yeah fantastic and I will remember there's a curse on the book

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.959
that we're reading from a Greek text that from the very beginning says there's a curse on anybody who touches

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:54.839
this who doesn't do it accurately yeah there is why wouldn't

00:10:54.839 --> 00:10:59.920
you respect that where do you think those curses come from do you see the

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.959
tradition in here the classical tradition okay and I'm about to tell you something it's going to scare everybody

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:12.760
it's going to scare everybody but okay here we go so um what's happening look I'm gonna provide for these two

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:21.240
witnesses right what are they goingon to do they're going to prophesy they're going to prophesy for

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.240
1,26 days and what's going to

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.959
happen they're going to do it when they're covered with Sak and what is Sak

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:42.120
now hang in there with me it's goat skin goat skin that is hairy and you're

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:49.279
gonna ask yourself right if you're in the fairy tale you're not reading this in the Greek you um it's going to sound

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:55.120
uh you know crazy to you oh how do they translate sackcloth and then they're going to tell you oh this is from a

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.240
Hebrew tradition which is bull which is completely bull

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:07.279
all yeah it's not it's verifiably linguistically not but because people

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:13.959
said that in order to justify see when the Christian and the Jewish Bibles were

00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:20.199
being produced in order to get themselves legitimacy they would say this is

00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:26.279
actually from the Hebrew when it wasn't this is one of those cases so you're seeing it for the first time you're

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:32.519

00:12:56.399 --> 00:13:02.639

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:05.760
right that's not the Last Frontier we're going to take two people and we're going to put them out

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:11.840
in public for display we're going to put them through

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.279
the right we're going to kill them for three days we're going to watch them

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:24.200
we're going to despise them if we're Witnesses of Christ we're going to despise them but after three and a half

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:32.000
days we're going to raise them from the dead and they are going to tell

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.080
us who's there they're going to tell us what was in the

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:43.919
Beyond yeah isn't that fantastic witnesses to the whole world and it's

00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:50.279
their decision to bring you a plague to bring you an

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:57.720
earthquake it's their decision now this is just the Bible that I'm translating for you I'm telling you

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:04.600
it's right there and it's so beautifully mother Greek that I just

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:11.039
can't oh the the to the all the seminarians out there and to all the

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:19.919
theologians now I know you're starting to look really bad really bad and that's good it's good

00:29:19.919 --> 00:29:28.440
for the public to be able to watch you fail it's good right for example the head of d

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:35.159
Seminary the head of Dallas Seminary is afraid to appear with me on Danny Jones

00:29:35.159 --> 00:29:40.360
to discuss what Christ thing is he's afraid and do you know why he's afraid

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:45.559
because he knows because he knows what will happen he saw it

00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:51.720
happen he knows what will happen the text is our

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:58.519
strength they want you to teach the Bible now and now we're talking about

00:29:58.519 --> 00:30:03.600
about blasphemy and what can be done to stop

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:11.240
it now is the time for us to teach them the reality this is the

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:18.559
spark your freedom is in the history see that's why it's not a cult it's why I'm not leading you it's why I'm not giving

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:24.039
you anything I'm showing you a tool so that

00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:31.679
you can go out and you can get there you can be SI sitting there with the people who invented democracy and you can say

00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:38.320
oh my oh my this is not what I had envisioned this is not what I had

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:44.120
envisioned it's not and I'll spank you for that shame on you for being in a

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:50.880
dream you're G to love what's going to happen you're G to love it it's heart-rending but you know that's the

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:56.440
that's beautiful beautiful tragedy okay give me give me the next one yeah that's

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:03.880
right give it to him give it to him for justice for Lady Justice a lot of spanker going on here look at this

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:09.279
Revelation 13 and I saw another base coming out of the earth and it had horns

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:17.039
two of them just like that lamb and it spoke the dragon's tongue now I want us to go in and see

00:31:17.039 --> 00:31:25.799
what the hell is being who right now remember all of this is being delivered

00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:32.720
prophetically they are using analogia

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:39.600
analog so when you see the painting of a beast

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:46.039
and that is mistaking the analog you're looking at at the at the

00:31:46.039 --> 00:31:52.960
type you're not looking at the real right we're supposed to be um in

00:31:52.960 --> 00:32:00.399
the mystery we're using language that autocar said was its own Vox its own

00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:06.679
voice right and that's what I'm bringing you this is the Revelation through the

00:32:06.679 --> 00:32:11.960
Vox through the Vox and my name is

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:17.279
Ammon love it give me the next one oh God watch this and the woman woman she

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:24.559
fled where'd she go where'd this woman go all of a sudden there's a woman here where' this woman go she went into the

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:30.760
Aron she went into the void right remember we got Jack into the void before we started talking to Angels

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.880
because that's where you talk to angels and the devil who rules

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:41.200
there okay just don't get caught in don't get caught in the

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:46.279
image right this is EXT multi-dimensional stuff that I don't

00:32:46.279 --> 00:32:53.039
understand the math of but when you get jacked in to that void so that you can

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:58.480
communicate with those powers that are outside of the ion

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:04.080
that's how they describe it I I still don't know what it means right okay so

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:10.559
that's what H that's what's happening here oh bad timing but that's okay leave that up leave that up look here we oh

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:16.000
that's nice void I wouldn't mind going there that's a void for a fun time

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.399
that's gorgeous right who couldn't come back from that without being happy you know what I mean come on okay give me

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:28.960
the next one JY give an next one and the woman fled into the void now this woman

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:35.200
where is she going into the void for is this a prophetic Mission no because she

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:41.919
I'm translating has her own place there that is specifically prepared in a

00:33:41.919 --> 00:33:47.320
position that is a way from God AP

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:53.720
to and that is always translated by God as an agent and the reason that your

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:58.760
translations do that is because it doesn't make sense

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:04.799
to the fairy tale because she is supposed to be the

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:13.480
bride the holy bride whose son will rule the world with a rod with

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:19.679
a rod the name for that Rod by the way is the one dionis uses right so get me the lubricant

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:26.720
please yes are you seeing where your religion is from you Christians for the first time it's just take the

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:33.200
interference take the bumpiness just okay write it out man you know you'll get in there Watch What Happens why does

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:39.960
the woman have a place there because she is nourished there she is nourished

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:47.599
there in this place away from God In This Place away from God she is

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:56.118
nourished do you remember who comes along it's the devil it's the devil right he rules the void the devil rules

00:34:56.119 --> 00:34:59.279
the void

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:08.200
okay okay do you see where we are fantastic let's keep going because

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:13.280
something magnificent is going to happen something wonderful give it to me give

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:21.440
it to me and I heard a great voice in uranos and it was saying look here's the

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:31.200
salvation and the power and the kingdom of God it is the authority of his Christ do

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:36.760
you know where the power in the kingdom of God is it's the authority in his

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.920
Christ do you know if you haven't been christed you're not part of the Kingdom

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:49.520
ask the boys ask the boys why is this all happening because

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:54.760
I'm translating because the accuser of our

00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:02.040
Bros it was thrown out he was thrown out of uranos and where did he end up he

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:10.319
ended up here Earth and what does he do he accuses accuses night and day it's all

00:36:10.319 --> 00:36:18.920
he can do this guy is accuse why is he accusing because it's the void we're in

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:25.160
the void and that's his world it's his judgment do you see what

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:33.200
they're looking at they're looking at Hades Hades doesn't scare a pagan it doesn't scare a

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:39.440
polytheist it scares a monest alone because that Hades is doing the very

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:45.440
same thing the very same thing that Yahoo is

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:53.079
doing it's his realm why do you think Jesus was like oh I'm being tempted you

00:36:53.079 --> 00:36:58.880
saw that uranos opened for him right right as he's going through it you mean

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:04.839
Jesus Christ was going through a ride on the cross and that's what killed him yes

00:37:04.839 --> 00:37:10.040
and they raised him from the dead three days later just like we're about to do

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:17.119
these Witnesses why do it take him three days I don't know I don't know it's the drugs

00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:23.040
maybe if you go too far you kill them maybe that's like the limit that you can go you know they're doing stuff to the

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:28.319
body while they're doing that too why do you think they found that boy in

00:37:28.319 --> 00:37:33.480
the tomb what do you think he was doing didn't anybody find out oh you

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:43.359
thought here comes the oh the Angels oh no no it's a right that boy is there

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:50.400
because that kid is part of the right and you notice what he's wearing what's the dude wearing little kid what he's

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:58.960
wearing the Gown that an initiate and a cult wears yeah right what is what is our

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.599
lace St right Jesus is a lace St too but what does our lace Alexander say he says

00:38:04.599 --> 00:38:12.079
make sure and bring me the boys that are the most pretty right don't don't bring me any boys with defects you think that

00:38:12.079 --> 00:38:17.760
when Jesus was picking out boys on the Sea of Galilee and he was like Hey you

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:24.920
and you you want to come with me you don't think those were pretty boys I'm about to show you where he took

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:31.880
them he took them somewhere private Peter James and John not only did were they the boys that he took to the to the

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:37.319
Garden of Gethsemane but he took them up into the mountains like he did Mary remember what he did with Mary what

00:38:37.319 --> 00:38:44.480
Jesus Christ did with Mary Magdalene he self-pleasuring ate

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:51.960
it and offered her and she was like oh my God right okay you didn't know that

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:57.960
Jesus existed did you yeah no they said it not me I didn't make that up I didn't

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:05.760
make that up hi Jesus doesn't he look looks like he

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:13.000
looks serious there he looks like he's a little bit angry like what' you put me in hell for I I didn't put you in hell

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.880
Jesus you put yourself in Hell gorgeous you got yourself crucified

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:24.359
can you imagine how what's what are your odds of getting yourself crucified when

00:39:24.359 --> 00:39:31.720
you're in the middle of a rot that involves s Tropic substances what what are the chances of

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:37.839
that right I don't think you can plan that good I don't think you can plan that

00:39:37.839 --> 00:39:44.880
good wonder what he did after they revived him I wonder what he did no seriously

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:51.119
people when you put somebody into the death right they appear and they say this in Antiquity they appear completely

00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:56.440
dead that's why media was able to put the dragon into a state where they

00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:05.839
thought he was dead right just with drugs that's how profoundly the thimon

00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:11.720
as they call it that Jesus said I'm going to give you this thimon in the gospel of Mark right

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:18.440
that drug death inducing drug um you know it takes it takes us three days to

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:25.119
do its job you revive the person and they're fraking born again born again it's the ride of rights

00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:31.880
now the funny thing is you got to put them into a sexual state right that's the part of it that I keep trying to

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:37.640
show you is in the Bible right we even had the ointment in the eyes we got

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:44.359
christed in our eyes right was that white christing I can't [Laughter]

00:40:44.359 --> 00:40:51.119
remember what is the world look people let me stop for a minute what is the world going to

00:40:51.119 --> 00:40:58.240
do when it realizes that christing is a drug process

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:04.400
and that the processes that are involved in christing are usually ending up in

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:09.520
sexual intercourse or some kind of stimulation

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:16.520

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:52.400
mystery we'll understand it we don't need Faith the ancient mystery is

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:58.119
anthropology right it's why Jesus Christ was arrested in a park with the naked

00:44:58.119 --> 00:45:04.280

says okay their bodies when they are given the death inducer and

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:32.280
they're going to sit there and what do we call this remember

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:38.079
the pneumatic gospel that we mentioned last time Mark is writing about a

00:45:38.079 --> 00:45:45.520
Pneumatic he's writing a form of a Pneumatic Gospel According to Clement and those guys right a Pneumatic gospel

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:52.440
something that you're going to give to people who are going to be involved in the ritual sex and drug

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:58.040
use right this is their gospel that's why he calls it here he says it's called

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:03.119
the the pneumatic Sodom where is the city that their

00:46:03.119 --> 00:46:08.400
bodies will be exhibited it's the pneumatic

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.480
Sodom you can also say Egypt that's just this person's

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:19.760
opinion right you could also say Egypt but you and I know what it is are you

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:25.000

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:34.400
where Kos the Lord was stal roast where he was

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:41.520

00:46:47.559 --> 00:46:55.520
thinking oh that means Jerusalem no you missed the point right it is that Sodom

00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:02.119
we will bring the CHR Christians to the place of the numatic Sodom that they

00:47:02.119 --> 00:47:09.160
created all we're doing is showing them right all we have to do we have to have a room full of fourth graders because

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:15.079
it's Oklahoma and we have to give them this right and we have to tell them this

00:47:15.079 --> 00:47:21.760

00:47:27.079 --> 00:47:32.720
running off bandage falling off of his private parts okay let's get going they know

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:40.400
that what a here okay people look what about anybody who cares about those two witnesses right um and

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:46.079
look these people that are going to watch this happen when we put when we

00:47:46.079 --> 00:47:52.839
take these two volunteers and we put them into the death State everybody's going to be watching

00:47:52.839 --> 00:47:58.119
this because it's going to be publicly exhibited all over the world you'll be able to see it and people will be able

00:47:58.119 --> 00:48:04.480
to see it who are speak different languages from different parts of the world different ethnicities everybody is

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:11.880
going to be able to see it and after three days right well before the three days it

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:17.040
says here um they're not going to allow the bodies to be to be intuned or

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:23.760
anything like that they're going to be publicly displayed because we want to see what's going to

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:28.880
happen right we've given them we've these are these are astronauts these are

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:35.880
po multi-dimensional astronauts right and we want to see what they're going to bring back so we're not

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:42.640
going to seal them up or anything or put them anywhere hidden right no bearing give it to me and what's gonna what's

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:48.559
gonna happen those those who live on the Earth are going to Rejoice they're gonna

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:56.319
be they're going to be so happy and they're going to give gifts to each other right why because these two

00:48:56.319 --> 00:49:01.400
Prophets have tortured them these are the

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:07.760
Christians these two prophets will be the answer to Christianity and the

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:13.640
Christians will hate that they are being put through this process to disprove

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:20.760
them and they'll appear to be dead so the Christians will be very happy they'll be in a giftgiving mood and

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:27.520
what's going to happen though hang on what's going to happen here's here here it is give it to me remember prophetic

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:35.640
don't change the words one bit right that's what the Angels say right the devil's an angel and after three days

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:43.200
and a half the spirit of Life Zoey spirit is Gonna Come From God and enter

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:49.520
into those men and they're going to stand up on their feet or those people could be one man one woman it could be

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:58.240
two women they're going to stand up on their feet and what are they gonna do a great fear is gonna fall on everybody

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:04.160
watching them why because we just sent those people

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:11.079
using an ancient technique which is very precise by the way there's a whole bunch of details in there we just sent people

00:50:11.079 --> 00:50:17.599
to the other side and you know what when the Christians see them come

00:50:17.599 --> 00:50:26.200
back and they hear their voices and what they say they're going to hate they're

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:33.359
going to hate because they're going to see their own Mystery exhibited we're going to see that

00:50:33.359 --> 00:50:40.040
christing if you can do a Christ thing yeah yeah then what kind of power do

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:47.720
they have right right what kind of power power they have this is not you cannot buy this right this is for the citizen

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:53.079
who cares about his or her neighbor it's not for the citizen who seeks profit

00:50:53.079 --> 00:50:58.359
which are you are you seeking profit or are you

00:50:58.359 --> 00:51:03.680

that's a historical fact you Christians W you better start cutting you better

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:41.799
start cutting off testicles because you're not doing anything that they did in Antiquity you're not doing anything

00:55:41.799 --> 00:55:47.400
that Jesus didn't remember Jesus is the number one spokesman did I tell you that

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:51.960
he's the number one spokesman for transgender

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:58.920
surgery he says let those who have the power to Bear it let them bear it let

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:05.079

away you know it's just part of the deal and when you do so they become a little

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:23.319
Factory you can pump drugs into them and you can use them to get your drugs you

00:56:23.319 --> 00:56:28.240

hoop Salon but their high mountains are not really high mountains right this is not you know not anything like you would

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:59.880
consider a high mountain but they've got some things right big hills and he takes

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:06.039
him up into the into the Backwoods and what does he do with his three kids that

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:37.000
right he's taking charge of them he carries them out into a place the text says where they can be

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:44.160
alone all by themselves why would Jesus want to be alone with teenage boys are

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:50.960
you gonna are you watch what happen it says I'm not kidding you it says he

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:58.039
transformed he transformed right in front of their faces okay are you ready remember

00:58:58.039 --> 00:59:04.880
remember there's drugs involved here there's crising right so okay he transformed and

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:10.559
what do he transformed to now those of you were Christians who thought the fairy tale right who believe in Peter

00:59:10.559 --> 00:59:16.160
Pan and that kind of thing you know what I mean I can fly right um you were

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:21.280
thinking something completely different that was going on because that is what

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:26.799
you have been taught through translation the theologians have so faked

00:59:26.799 --> 00:59:32.880
your texts that you can't really see that underlying classical layer to them

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:42.960
that first century layer you can't and what happens what happens what do the kids do they say holy crap um Elijah and

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:50.559
Moses are standing there all of a sudden and they're talking to

00:59:50.559 --> 00:59:57.520
Jesus wait a minute he took you out of the woods right and he sudden he does

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:04.119
something and he transforms right has he been giving you guys stuff to eat again right people

01:00:04.119 --> 01:00:09.599
talk about Jesus feeding the multitude okay you realize when he

01:00:09.599 --> 01:00:14.640
dipped that bread into the into the stuff the bull that gave that made Judas

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:20.039
act so weird right and go off and tell on

01:00:20.039 --> 01:00:26.000
him right he's been drugging these people right he's been drugging them

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.319
he's drugged on the cross hanging there his death inducer reaches him while he's

01:00:31.319 --> 01:00:36.680
being crucified and so what happens they see

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:42.000
Moses and Elijah holy crap what what happens what happens look it gets funny

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.359
it gets funny and people never read the Bible so they don't re realize the humor yep what happens we're almost done

01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:53.960
people and he a Peter answers them and he says to him hey Rabbi hey Rabbi right

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:59.559
now what is really cool about this r ref to Rabbi is Jewish rabbis don't appear

01:00:59.559 --> 01:01:05.280
until like the first maybe as early as the second but the first really right

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:11.839
and they really make Judaism the Judaism that you see worship today the synagogue

01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:16.920
Judaism really starts in helenistic um

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:22.920
Alexandria right and it gets a text develops text the rabinal Judaism the

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:29.920
thing that you call Judaism all the rights and H holidays and laws

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:35.920
that doesn't come out until the first BC first ad somewhere in that range right

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:41.720
and Jesus is right there you don't have rabbis in the fifth century BC that

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:47.119
doesn't exist right Jesus is coming about this

01:01:47.119 --> 01:01:55.359
is what's going to screw with your brain tonight Jesus is coming about at the same time that the first

01:01:55.359 --> 01:02:05.920
rabbi are coming about and he is being called a rabbi therefore Jesus is a founder of

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.760
Judaism oh my God

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:18.079
Yahoo yahu Hashem and all the crew holy

01:02:18.079 --> 01:02:21.079
mackerel

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:30.799
W okay so you mean Judaism and Christianity are two monis Cults that

01:02:30.799 --> 01:02:37.200
develop out of the same bed yeah and they're both influenced by the Greek

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:44.319
mystery yeah oh my God my

01:02:44.319 --> 01:02:51.160
God don't you love that history is gorgeous the real history is more beautiful than the you know the the fake

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:56.240
stuff and when everybody saw the Theologian either here or Danny Jones or

01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:01.440
noticing for I know I can't remember who ran the clips and who did what um but

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.720
when they saw him say uh Duck Tales Dan right when they

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:13.119
saw the theologians step up there and say well our earliest you know is Isaiah

01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:18.760
8th Century blah blah hooa are you sure it's the 8th century and it's not right

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:24.119
none of those texts go back that far right there isn't any Hebrew at that

01:03:24.119 --> 01:03:29.559
time doesn't exist all right there's a ton of Greek there's

01:03:29.559 --> 01:03:37.559
50,000 because you know there's 50,000 copies there at least by one report is 50,000 Scrolls in Alexandria alone and

01:03:37.559 --> 01:03:43.960
Alexandria is not doesn't end up being the only library right Romans have libraries

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:51.839
too fantastic and there's mostly Greek why is that oh it's gorgeousness

01:03:51.839 --> 01:03:58.279
okay give me the give me that same verse again let me just make sure I got it all yeah oh okay so he call no I didn't get

01:03:58.279 --> 01:04:05.680
it all he calls him Rabbi he says look this is Peter they're up in the mountain Jesus did some kind of transformation

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:13.200
and now they're seeing dudes talking to Jesus and Peter says hey um well it's

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.720
good for us to be here right which is a weird why would you start with that

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:24.680
right is it is there a question maybe you shouldn't be there okay but it's good for us to be here right and to see

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:31.119
this stuff let's make make three tents one for you one for Moses and one for

01:04:31.119 --> 01:04:40.000
Elijah and now watch this right because they're seeing they're seeing stuff give me the next give me give me the next

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:45.720
one um Jesus didn't

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:54.400
know how to answer him for they the kids were EC

01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:03.400
phobic that act as an intensifier phobic is being afraid they were totally terrified right

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:09.200
and that's why Peter's telling oh it's okay it's okay we're it's okay that we're here let's build three temples

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:16.319
let's build three tents three one for you one for you one for you and Jesus doesn't know how to answer him right now

01:05:16.319 --> 01:05:26.240
this is the Son of God we're talking about and look at the first five words of this line of Mark 96 ugar

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:34.720
T he didn't know what to say in response

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:42.400
he didn't know how to respond right does that sound like an allower to you that doesn't it sounds

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:49.520
like a dude who's out drugging children for the sake of sex rights yeah he already had mared is this

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:55.279
the same place he took Mary if I had a place where I took

01:05:55.279 --> 01:06:01.559
people oh you know you know my kids could say oh you know Dad he takes people out to

01:06:01.559 --> 01:06:07.119
the [Laughter] Backwoods

01:06:07.119 --> 01:06:12.200
right who does this who does

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:18.480
this yeah I'll tell you who does it some creepo some Creo these kids are put into

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:24.400
that that Panic right the drugs are putting them into a panic just keep

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:31.400
going and what happens he says uh a cloud oh okay at this point there's a

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:38.599
cloud that covers everything and makes it dark and this voice speaks out of the cloud right you know the you know

01:06:38.599 --> 01:06:44.119
Peter's totally freaked out by this point right I mean he is defecating in

01:06:44.119 --> 01:06:50.920
his robes you know what I mean they're the it's falling onto his sandals right

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:56.880
at this point at this point one of those three boys has has soiled himself I

01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:04.200
guarantee you I guarantee you and what does this booming voice out of the sky say right so you can see the kids laying

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:09.839
on the ground and you can see Jesus like H how do I and they're like ah right and

01:07:09.839 --> 01:07:17.440
Jesus is like how do I deal with this and he doesn't know how to deal with it and he says this is the Son of

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:24.119
God this is the Son of God listen up

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:31.480
right oh my God oh my God it's just it's

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:38.119
ridiculous it's ridiculous but it's anthropologically it makes a lot of sense because there's a lot of people

01:07:38.119 --> 01:07:43.480
very contemporary right first century authors just look at plenty who talks

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:48.960
about in the natural history about the Magi using drugs to interrogate people

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:56.880
right you can you can put somebody into a hallucinatory state and then you can question them right well you you not

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:03.960
just a fact find and they did it for the sake of people who were involved in uh conspiracies to overthrow the government

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:09.039
they would drug them and then find out if they were involved right um but not

01:08:09.039 --> 01:08:14.440
just for that but for religious training if you can put your mind into that Panic

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:23.400
right pan pan was alive then he died right he's now coming back that

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:29.238
Panic if you can put somebody if you can Kim Ally indu that Panic you can

01:08:29.239 --> 01:08:35.920
restructure their mind you can restructure their mind you can program

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:42.040
them yeah isn't that fantastic and with Jesus standing over them now the Magi

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:47.480
did it remember the same same Magi are the ones that are funding Jesus they're the ones who paid for him to go to

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:56.880
school in Egypt they're the ones who gave him all the drug base right and um so realiz it's them

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:03.400
and they're what what do we have descriptions of these Magi what are they doing Jesus isn't the in indol he's not

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:10.120
the highest dude in the rankings right those Magi are the one who started this whole thing Mary is sitting in the

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:16.000
temple being nourished do you understand the woman who Bears the child you know

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.120
what the devil does the devil eats the child do you

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:27.278
understand do you understand did you see the verse talked about her being

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:32.359
nourished there in the void right Mary's fingers were

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:39.359
reportedly stained with the purple okay it is a

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:44.758
basic compound that is being used in rights that

01:09:44.759 --> 01:09:51.520
induce psychotropic you know hallucination and uh uh Changes in

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:58.400
Attitude changes in even bearing and gate you can change somebody's gate given the right drug anyway these Magi

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:04.320
would stand over the people that they're working with and they could assume the

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:09.560
voices of different powers because the person was under the

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:18.600
influence Jesus is doing the same Magic on these kids and when you think about it you mean Jesus was having to drug and

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:24.080
manipulate mentally manipulate children um that's how what the Kingdom of Heaven

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:31.560
is made of he says that he says that Kingdom of Heaven is you got to become one of these children right nobody gets

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:36.760
in who isn't now what are we going to do to the

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:43.640
two witnesses right we've got to get them to that same place we've got to do exactly

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:49.440
what the Christians did to two witnesses we've got to display it and

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:55.800
when they come back they must prophesy they must it's fantastic I love it I

01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:02.880
love it you think people are courageous who go to the Moon those people have a ton of Courage they have a ton of

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:10.000
Courage but they don't send them up unless they're pretty sure they can get them

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:17.640
back right you have to go these new astronauts these two they got to go to

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.080
death and then be retrieved got to go to death and then

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:29.480
brought back and you can do it with the chemistry it turns out what you're bathing the brain

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:38.198
with is all that matters don't say bloodbrain barrier right don't say

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:44.560
it love it love it we're gonna get right through it right down right down to that

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:51.960
chemistry and everybody's GNA know it oh Boom by the way I've got some chemists taking great that's fantastic they can

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:57.840
they can help give me the next go up boom let's go we've only got two more people

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:03.360
two or three more yeah that's it that's it and immediately what happened

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:11.159

01:12:11.159 --> 01:12:16.280

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:49.920
going on it wears off it wears off and they look around it's only Jesus he's

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:55.800
just standing there of course it did right of course it's just Jesus right

01:12:55.800 --> 01:13:00.920
did you think it was a fair did you think Here Comes Elijah Here Comes Moses

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:06.440
hey Mo right Moses didn't didn't exist until two centuries before this right

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:13.679
that's when he was invented right and he's he's even taken from an earlier person which is

01:13:13.679 --> 01:13:18.760
insulting insulting right I mean come on you could make up your own dude yeah had

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:26.600
to used somebody else's name and place because they had the place of privilege within the cult come come on man get new

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:32.080
monism always borrows whether it's Judaism Christianity or Islam monism

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:38.800
will always borrow from what came before those Satanic Verses that came before

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:45.639
they will borrow from that to make something and you can read what is not original in the

01:13:45.639 --> 01:13:53.040
religions just read their texts read the Quran yeah yeah I advise you to learn

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.040
classical Arabic because you're not going to get it down to the soil unless you can do classical Arabic right

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:08.320
alhamdulilah okay give me the next one where are we boom and oh yeah so

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:16.440
what do they do what do they do coming out of the mountain right he told them don't talk

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:22.080
about okay remember you were Jesus Christ three

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:27.280
boys they have just been scared out of their lives they probably look like they've just

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:34.840
been run around a track a thousand times but they've just been scared out of their lives they've heard the great

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:40.800
voice from above tell them who this guy Jesus was they saw these people with him

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:48.440
then they were gone then they were gone and what does Jesus tell them what is the Son of God what does your Christ

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:56.760
tell them sh don't talk about what we did not

01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:02.719
talking about so the two of them just I mean the three of them they just walk around they agree to be quiet about it

01:15:02.719 --> 01:15:08.639
but they talk with each other about what it means to enter into

01:15:08.639 --> 01:15:13.800
death what it means to enter into look at the bottom line

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:20.000
Eon what does it mean coming out of that death entering into and coming out of

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.960
death what does it mean that's what they focus on right and

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:36.080
they didn't say anything until after Jesus entered death and was resurrected

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:42.400
they didn't say anything right they were good boys they kept their mouth shut about that stuff there's remember what

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:49.040
Clement said and this is dude's a saint right um

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:55.360
there's something you don't have to tell everybody the whole truth you don't there doesn't say anywhere you got to be

01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:01.000
truthful to everybody all the time okay these boys how do you think

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:09.040
they get these boys to do what they do literally the dude has a place where he walks people off into the hills and they

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:14.199
come back and they don't talk about what

01:16:14.199 --> 01:16:19.360
happened now if you're a psychologist or a therapist out there and I know some

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:25.080
therapists watch lady Babylon um because I don't know if it's they want to give

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:30.120
me therapy or maybe it's therapy for them I don't know but if I told a

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:38.840
therapist you yo bra I've got a place let's go you and me right and then

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:45.400
I tell you on the way sh you can't tell now if I told my therapist I had that place my therapist would turn me in

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:51.360
would turn me in and that's why Jesus Christ is walking around all the time

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:57.520
say I'm gonna get caught I'm I'm going to get crucified oh

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:05.320
you're you believe the fairy tale and you were thinking he's like oh this is the non-f farting Jesus

01:17:06.239 --> 01:17:12.760
right I've come here to die on a cross that's what you thought right no the

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:18.880
dude is scared he's gonna get crucified because why because that's what you do

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:25.280
to a you crucify them it's the only answer when you get somebody who's into

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:33.800
a religion that's so deep it is drugging children um doing things to them that

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:40.159
have to do with you know things that we can't talk about on YouTube um

01:17:40.159 --> 01:17:46.440
non-consensual things yes

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:51.920
right that the only solution for that and I think most people would feel this

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:59.080
this isn't odd or strange the only solution is to crucify him to finish him

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:04.840
off man those people who were willing to go that for for the kingdom of God these

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:10.120
are bad people they will abduct your children and cut off their

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:15.520
testicles so that they can turn them into sex slaves who are controlled by

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:21.239
drugs right now I know that's not fantasy to you right we all know that

01:18:21.239 --> 01:18:27.520
dark things happen right Jesus happened to be one of those people and that's why

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:33.320
when he's arrested in Matthew it says he raises his hands and he says I am not a

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:38.560
St I am not a child trafficker I'm not one of these people who's sexually

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.679
abusing these children right that's what he says

01:18:43.679 --> 01:18:49.400
right okay okay one more I think we've got one more is that bottom one oh

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:55.400
something's got to get my goat in a minute hang on and um what happened so they guarded the word right they didn't

01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:01.880
say anything but they walked around thinking about it that whole Resurrection from the dead thing that

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:08.080
was the lesson that went out to them that's the grooming that's the control

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:15.639
look people whether if I want to enter an ancient mystery religion you know what I have to do I gotta shave my head

01:19:15.639 --> 01:19:22.239
I gotta fast for like two weeks never fast for two weeks it's a pain right and

01:19:22.239 --> 01:19:28.080
I'm not talking you just don't eat during the daytime that's not a fast right this is a real fast where you're

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:33.880
not eating you're drinking that's it that's difficult right I don't want to

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:40.840
do that I got to shave my head I got to put on their special robes I got to go through all the ablutions all the

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:46.239
Washings I've got to sit for two weeks and listen to some old person and they

01:19:46.239 --> 01:19:51.920
in invariably have bad breath and they're telling this chant

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:58.239
this right oh God what kind of dedication do I have to

01:19:58.239 --> 01:20:04.800
have to go through all of that right so the process of teaching the initiate is

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:10.560
a process of formation it's what Catholicism does

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:17.520
with students in seminary I taught a seminary I know they call it formation only this formation is over a

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:23.440
much shorter period it involves starvation and the use of psychotropic

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:28.639
drugs so

01:20:28.639 --> 01:20:38.080
Jesus as a mogue as we saw last from last week as a hierophant in his mystery

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:45.159
that is hidden within mark his what they call his pneumatic M gospel his

01:20:45.159 --> 01:20:52.880
pneumatic gospel he is operating with those children your Christian mystery is

01:20:52.880 --> 01:21:00.840
the abuse of children and every time you go to church every time you drink that

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:09.600
grape juice and that thing is transubstantiated in your mouth every time you are doing that for

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:16.880
the sake of a child abuser and that child abuser got crucified for being a

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:26.560
child abuser I want to stop there with a text

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:33.800
and I want to tell you the future is the two witnesses the

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:40.560
Beast is revealed the future is the

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:49.120
restarting of that mystery that travel that is the final frontier you cannot go

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:55.280
any further right here we can go from star to star from planet to planet

01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:01.840
right we're looking with our Scopes and we're doing everything we can to get as far get as far away from our origin as

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:09.800
possible at least get our minds out there so we can understand what's going on this type of travel is the next

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:16.679
Dimension it's the next Dimension up and it's that form of travel that we get

01:22:16.679 --> 01:22:22.600
Christianity from it's that form of travel that we get Judaism from and

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:29.880
ultimately with some development you get Islam right your Islamic ancestors are

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:35.400
worshippers of Aphrodite and bakus and we're not going to get there unless we

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:42.239
go with them it's the whole right right so um let's get busy and bring those two

01:22:42.239 --> 01:22:49.000
witnesses um here's what I here's what I have for you by way of news so um I and

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.960
I don't want um I'm i' I've obviously used all of my time up tonight so I'm

class that will work with your time zone um and what we're do what are we people doing we're building an army of people

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:51.159
who can translate these texts for themselves so that we facilitate another renissance and the outpouring of of

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:56.480
people who are just possessed by the classical Muse is amazing if you haven't

01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:04.400

I can I'm trying to get as many people as I can I'm considering just a class on

01:24:10.679 --> 01:24:16.880

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.239
Greek but I want to learn this literature so yeah so that um that's

01:24:22.239 --> 01:24:28.280
what I'm doing uh is trying to create facilitate that environment I'm thinking

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:34.520
about maybe a class on literature as well I don't know if I can though I've already got four and that's gonna that's

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:39.960
going to take uh along with my students that I tutor privately it's going to

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:45.400

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:52.480
people who are um gonna go ahead and and enroll in the 20 weeks and uh we'll have

who can who can do this now that I'm free and I'm not working for my boss

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:17.560
who's taking 30% um I can pass that on to you so I am

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:24.520
I am more than happy to take scholarships and spread them around to whoever gets them and otherwise it's the

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:30.560
cost of a movie right and by the way I've been told I just want to say this

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:38.239
right and Nemesis please understand that I'm not trying to B brag I was told by a

01:25:38.239 --> 01:25:43.560
professor very famous Professor who was a Harvard alumnist that the Greek that I

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:49.159
worked on with them and the translation I did the analysis of the book of uh the

01:25:49.159 --> 01:25:56.880
apocalypse was better than anything that he seen come out of Harvard okay so um

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:02.520
I'm basically for the price of a movie ticket I'm trying to it's a price to

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:08.199
keep my lights on I'm trying to get people trained so that they can really

01:26:08.199 --> 01:26:15.480
participate they can really taste that that beauty that's there in the language

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:23.119
so yeah yeah and I've got people offering scholarships and whatnot so and I don't want any of my Tas to pay my ta

01:26:23.119 --> 01:26:28.560
should be able to take all the for free right and um uh because they're

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:36.800
supporting the system and if you go to uh old boy and to Nancy um they are

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:42.600
working now I know I'm leaving out ion and and the rest of the crew uh but they

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:48.440
are working now to help you through this textbook that we're using and we

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:56.119
officially have the biggest Greek program on the planet um I like to tell people it's it's uh $

01:26:56.119 --> 01:27:03.480
59,6 cheaper than Harvard yeah so but yeah I've got to

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:09.760
keep the lights on you know how much I hate talking money right and all boy is excellent by the way all boy is

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:17.360

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:23.000
you very much but I cannot do that devil said explicitly you got to work for it

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:29.080
bro you got work for it it's got to be by your sweat right and you gotta not

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:35.520
only that but he said you gotta barely barely be able to make

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:40.760
it and I was like why and he was like because once you get tainted with profit

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:47.000
seeking and it will happen once you get tainted with propit seeking that's it so

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:56.119

faculty that can help you get to a point that you're you're working on

01:30:16.159 --> 01:30:21.600
these texts let me just say one thing I want to say one thing about a student former student of mine who's going to be

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:27.159
coming back into the reading group his specialty is Byzantine Greek I won't

01:30:27.159 --> 01:30:32.280
tell you his name or anything but his specialty is Byzantine Greek he that's

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:37.600
the stuff he loves man and he gets all high on Byzantine authors I love so I

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:43.239
worked with him for a while we worked on late classical sources kind of the

01:30:43.239 --> 01:30:49.639
bridge to the B heavy Byzantine stuff and um he's coming back because he wants

01:30:49.639 --> 01:30:56.040
to do some raing In classical now and he went away to dumb Bart and Oaks oh my

01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:01.760
