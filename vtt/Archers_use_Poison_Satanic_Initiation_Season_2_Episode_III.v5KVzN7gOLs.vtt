[Music]

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.320
we're gonna begin tonight with a guy named scribonius largas we're gonna find

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.579
him we're gonna pull him from the grave we're gonna talk to him and see what he says in his own words we're gonna see

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:50.220
what he says about these Cults that you and I have been looking at we're going to look at the saturnian toxicum yes the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.880
saturnian toxicum what is the saturnian toxicum

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.360
um well let's pull that down that too um I want to First explain to you that

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.399
we're looking at what I'm going to show you tonight is Latin first of all we're not going to look at Greek we're going

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.739
to look at Latin look a little bit of Greek but we're going to look at the Roman side through the physician who was

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.940
connected to the legions and may or may have not been uh chief

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.879
Sir Chief physician to Claudius but he was certainly from what he talks about

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.400
he was certainly involved with military medicine

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.140
fantastic fortunately he preserved for us the a work called the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:51.959
compositiones which is prescription after prescription after prescription for different types of compound drugs he

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.620
doesn't talk he's not big on Theory he's big on practice and what works in treatment

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.560
um well what we can do with all sorts of injuries

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.220
um for for today we have the example of the arrow poison um and I wanna I wanna just take you

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.500
there to begin with um let's go to scribonius here and I

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.680
want you to take a look at this passage at the bottom you notice the very first word notice

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.700
the very first word is toxicum yes so this is a very specific drug

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.980
compound that he's about to tell us about a very specific one and that is

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.180
not a native Latin word when you see that c you're going to know that you're you're taking a loan word

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.299
from the Greek and the Greek is toxicon can we bring up toxic costs please the

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.900
top good and if you just take a if you just take a quick look at this definition you know

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.720
um you you'll notice right away over for the bow wait a minute I thought you were talking

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.940
about drugs here I am just wait we'll get there you talk about a kind of Crete

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.519
and Reed right the calamus the toxic calamus is a kind of Creighton

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.100
Reed that was used for arrows arrows we're talking bow culture with this word

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.600
right and if you look down um Roman numeral number two a person skilled in the use of the bow here we have a bow

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.180
culture right I bet they got horses too but I want you to look at Roman numeral

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.500
number three notice that the Bowman that took so tie those bowmen are there but then under

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:46.380
number two we have toxicon pharmacon a poison for smearing Arrows with

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.600
yes you see at the very bottom it's the equivalence of the women it's it's uh

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.699
he's saying here it's a it's a toxin it's a drug fantastic so let's go back

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:03.360
to the text that we've got from scrabonis I just want you to notice a couple of words and then I'm going to show you a video but I want you to know

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.660
it's toxicum yeah yeah and um you know when somebody gets a hold of this stuff whether

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.360
they're drinking it he says or whether it's inflicted from an injury it's the

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.660
same response that the person has and what is this terrible terrible reaction

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:28.020
right away there's this terrible pain in the guts all of the guts

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.500
all over the guts terrible pain like someone threw a javelin through you yeah

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.900
and it creates a furorementes it creates

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:48.120
a crazed State of Mind a fury not just any sort of craze but a fury

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:59.900
a fury of mind and what else does this thing do um it it compels its users to excelare

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.840
that's to make an ululation but to do it in the backic way with head

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.880
back oh isn't that wonderful wonderful description look they're making bucket

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.060
shouts screams can you do the bacchic scream you can do the bach extreme right

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:24.919
well this drug will let you do the bonus scream and what else

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.580
oh it gets a little bit gross here I gotta put a rating on this you guys better watch out because this gets

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.940
pretty gross it causes you to throw around your tongue just like someone whose head has just

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.699
been cut off now they are watching heads get cut off uh

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:51.660
in all sorts of ways so apparently you had to be there to see the heads get cut off but apparently you

00:06:51.660 --> 00:07:00.020
got some funny stuff that you do with your tongue and when your head gets cut off and these people who are in the

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:06.419
munatic revelry enter into this stage with the toxicon

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:12.120
um it's the drug that is used people are saying now wait okay we're gonna spank

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:19.199
someone when we get back but what I want you to do now before we finish this gorgeous text because it is full of

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:24.419
goodies I want you to see a little video that I've prepped for you and this video

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:30.479
will explain to you in images and in song it'll explain to you in images and

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:35.880
in song the direction that scrivonius is leading us with is

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:44.039
toxicum yes um Chewie hit it I can't see no future for me in this

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:49.259
world and looking back on the past if

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:56.460
it's gonna be more of the same calling into the game cause I've had about

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:02.940
enough of that and they wonder why

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:12.919
[Music]

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:18.620
every time I get lonely

00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:26.340
turn to the wine time that I do

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:32.870
[Music] I [Music]

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:39.140
[Applause] turned on me

00:08:41.809 --> 00:09:03.350
[Music]

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:10.799
[Applause] [Music]

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:20.160
it's on the Venoms man I'm telling you it's all in the Venoms your history was

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.100
created by a group of women who were getting

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:32.760
people to enter into death and life states to be reborn with a toxic venom

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:39.120
a toxic venom this is the heart of the mystery and

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.120
let's see what else let's see what else we can do with that toxic venom that

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.220
they're using on their Arrow um I know that we can get there if we

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.500
milk those snakes can we milk some snakes

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:03.430
[Music]

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:11.480
[Music] thank you

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:18.300
so there we have it what helps in these cases scrivonius tell us what can you do

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.580
so you've you've had the you've had your taste of it you've had your drink of it

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:29.160
and it specifies this is for the ones who partake in the potation right this

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:36.540
is them right it's the same effect that has hitting somebody with it on the Arrow but this is the paralyzing fear

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:43.019
that one enters into when one is under the influence of the drug that allows

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:49.380
you to ascend into death and to be resurrected um and what helps for it well you know

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:55.320
for those who uh drink it um it's we need to you know get some

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.800
Rose um some potable rows that's interesting some Rose potion okay

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:08.100
get some nose potion and is there anything else sure there's a couple other plants but um I want you to mix it

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.140
with lactate at antidoto mistradatio

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:19.680
with milk and with the again milk it doesn't have to be milk like you thank

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:26.540
milk um but it says milk so milk and the

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.800
mithridatic antidote which is funny and it makes perfect sense contextually I

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.140
don't know why classists don't use any of this um but it makes perfect sense because

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:42.240
the um emperor Nero

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:50.160
is interested in the very same antidote so it would make sense that

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.279
again we're in a crime scene we have to step back and we realize that we're reading to you the witness tonight is a

00:11:56.279 --> 00:12:01.440
witness connected with the legions this is the highest of the high

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.019
yeah this is the first and you're the last right this is this is the one and

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:14.279
he is bringing the recipes for the antidotes that are used in

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:23.339
conjunction with the Pagan mystery communion yeah yeah fantastic right above that

00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:29.339
you'll see ephemeron in the recipe above that you'll see ephemeron that is what

00:12:29.339 --> 00:12:35.700
we call colchicine right yeah we get culture scene from it

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:42.480
right caucus it's literally the Greek just caucus all right so it's one of

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:48.899
those ones and be careful with that one it tells you you burn yourself with that one right you'll get you get quite

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:55.500
burned up I want to show you I want to read you a little bit of Valerius flaccus

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:02.720
I want to read you a little bit of hilarious flakkus and I want you to see the

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.160
working of the ancient magic what is that what is the person doing okay so we

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.200
know that they're entering the right and they're using that they're milking

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:20.820
um Vipers they're milking vipers they're milking poison venomous snakes in order to make

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:29.519
to add ingredients to these um yes uh communions that they're using

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:36.899
yeah these potions these compound um this compound drug that ultimately

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:41.940
will end up ultimately will end up with the

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:47.639
um with the medwa now somebody was asking me do we know if they smoked and

00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:54.720
this is an old question um and one that I was just asking again do we know if they smoked they performed

00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:00.839
fumigations they perform fumigations they walk around with Marlboros in Antiquity as

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:08.160
Claudius going to worry about his troops pulling out that he's responsible for pulling out marbles no he's not he's got

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.500
to be worried about them entering into fumigations that will get them involved

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:19.260
in drinking things and administering things anally

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:24.420
um and um administering things via incisions on the skin

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:29.639
yeah and by performing things like this um fumigation you feel the whole room

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:38.220
it's like hot boxing you just fill the whole room with fumes right from you remember your religions are based upon

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:47.399
taking incense and putting them upon a burning altar right this is where

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:52.500
everything starts right your Western religions are built upon that I can't

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:58.860
speak for these but for the Western religions they're built upon that this burning of the incense and the temples

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:06.000
come on Jehovah never lied about that one he lied about a lot but he didn't lie about that one right pull down those

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.420
temples where they're burning incense to those gods right where they're entering those

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:19.680
States so breathing breathing this incense breathing this uh fumigated

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:26.940
substance is that like smoking um yeah if you're getting fumigated uh you

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:32.339
might as well be your step up from secondary that's for sure but you know

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:39.120
you probably classified as secondary smoking okay that's neat I want to read you a little passage from Valerius

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:49.139
flacus now to bring us all to a place where we're at the same spot there's this guy costes who comes from the West

00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:57.180
to the east to see Medea in performing uh what she was became so well known for

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:02.760
that we can't even translate properly so tonight we looked at it we looked at

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:09.180
somebody entering a a bacchic phase with these drugs we saw them entering this

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:15.720
hilarity head back saying the things that scribonius says are hard to be

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:24.360
interpreted right what they say so um now I want to go to this

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:31.380
late Bronze Age um worker of sorcery co-hostes that we see

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:37.680
in the in Valerius flaccus argonautica his story about

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:43.139
the medwa he says mightiest among them in stygian

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:49.860
arts kawas days comes he's the mightiest what is this did you in the what the

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:57.480
stygian Arts yeah those of the underworld Arts

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:04.500
yeah those are the Arts that make us all afraid at night when we have our

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:09.900
nightmares those are the Arts that are doing it

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:15.660
you know these are the necromancers necromancers um anyway

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:22.880
not love of War excites him but the fame of city of the Satan maid

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:30.419
a breathing poisons in match to his own

00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:37.260
um that's the trans uh translation um who is this it's not in uh

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:42.960
who is this let me give you the Mosley this is the mostly translation

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:48.720
but in the line that he translates poisons equal to yours is the difficulty

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:55.860
there's a difficulty with the Greek just the terrible I mean with the Latin just a terrible terrible difficulty and I

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:01.020
will uh I will read it to you in Latin and translate it literally

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:07.919
so lickitot neck Martis Amor um the love of war the love of Mars does

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:14.280
not move him love of Mars don't you love that now you know why the fleece

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:20.820
which the garden which the dragon guards is hanging in

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:26.160
the Grove of Mars it's important that you understand that image wise

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:33.600
it's important that you understand put yourself in that place if we're in the Grove of Mars yes so not the love of

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:43.320
Mars said farmer kataya we're a Guinness but the satin virgin

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.780
Medea yeah

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:58.260
yeah doing what spearons what draws him her spirons breathing

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:04.380
inhaling party bus

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:11.240
Winans um balanced

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:20.400
drugs poisons inhaling them yeah now we call this and we see this in

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:26.220
on the metal side this breathing of the of the uh drug and remember these drugs

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:32.460
that they're using are not all things that they aerosolize right these are not all fumigations that they're performing

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:38.460
there's a lot of incense involved and there's a lot of exposure to that instance but a lot of these that are

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:47.760
administered um rectally orally um ocular wise in slits in the skin a

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:53.340
lot of these drugs are not kinds that you would use in fumigations so what

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:58.919
exactly its meaning it's mystery what is it meaning when it

00:19:58.919 --> 00:20:04.380
says he was so impressed this Necromancer right now that he's gone the

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:11.580
text says now they left his homeland to come see this um to come see the medwa perform this

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:18.740
act he uh he the people can sleep safely and soundly and because he's no longer

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:25.799
drawing down the Moon yeah he's no longer drawing down the

00:20:25.799 --> 00:20:33.080
Moon so he is with her now in order to see her breathe

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:39.960
in these equal these balanced poisons

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:46.620
yeah so and that word for breathing is associated in Antiquity with the Romans

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.900
with the inspiration the breadth of inspiration

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:58.860
right she is a weirago we just read about a weirago last time

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:06.179
correct we saw that Eve the one who cries Ewa she is the wirago all right we

00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:11.640
saw that's how they described her as the weird ago we are squarely with Roman

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:20.820
Minerva squarely with her and it is she that gets us to that place by worship of the

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:26.760
muses by worship of the muses she gets us to that place

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:34.919
um and her breathing her breathing is through

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:40.620
equal equally balanced drugs

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:46.980
equally balanced poisons she's oftentimes said Seneca claims that

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:54.020
she has um a compound created from different

00:21:54.419 --> 00:22:03.840
uh Venoms snake Venoms and in her very authentic incantation

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:11.280
um she invokes ophiuchus so we are seeing now you see in the

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:17.240
tradition of the epics he's in the poetic Traditions you see

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:22.320
Medea's medicine emerging but you can see the very same

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.559
medicine in the text of the

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:33.900
Imperial doctors of the highest ranking Imperial doctors

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.940
and in the doctors who serve people like Nero

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:47.220
so We Are One Step Closer to completing the

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:54.299
scene completing that crime scene our concern and people have been talking

00:22:54.299 --> 00:23:02.159
about this our concern is to bring back lady Babylon that's the

00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:10.020
mission right to understand that reality to um to see and to know to have eyes to

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:15.299
see and ears to hear to not follow a fairy tale but to worship reason

00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:20.460
an honor reason so we want to bring back that image

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:26.159
we're stuck here at this scene with Jesus Jesus Christ arrested in a public

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:33.299
park slash Cemetery at early early morning hours with a naked

00:23:33.299 --> 00:23:40.799
boy and what is he doing there under those circumstances we're beginning to be able

00:23:40.799 --> 00:23:46.860
to see at least a history of where these drug rights come from

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:55.559
and to see that they're entrenched within very high levels of ancient Society there's a

00:23:55.559 --> 00:24:02.039
reason that the bakic suppression of 186 or 185 whenever

00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:08.360
it is that that would be see that that was um a reaction to

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:14.580
this cult operating with the highest levels of the aristocracy we're told

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:20.520
that it was the women that were getting rounded up and it said they were they were arresting the wives

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:26.640
the Senators who were involved um and how did they how did they know

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:32.940
that they were involved in the conspiracy because of the drugs

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:40.980
yeah because of the drugs that's how they identified them isn't it interesting to know that if it

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:47.400
was a conspiracy as the Romans viewed it a conspiracy not just the free expression of religion but we're talking

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:53.520
when religion and and political power are the same thing

00:24:53.520 --> 00:25:00.720
um yes you see the bakkens today when we when we say when the Romans say

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:09.480
yes it was a conspiracy because they were trying to take power um we need to consider then that this is

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:15.900
really this is no longer fairy tale world this is a very human place that we've come to

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:22.080
and we need to consider these sources if I were to tell you some of the secrets

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.179
that are in these things you might start getting

00:25:27.179 --> 00:25:34.799
you might start getting paranoid about uncovering even further what what

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:41.880
is behind thee what is behind the facade um were women

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:50.580
staying at home all of these drug Traditions come from

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:58.919
female practice the oldest ones that we have come from the Gynecology and obstetrics

00:25:58.919 --> 00:26:04.020
so somebody out there right now is told today is talking about

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:10.220
um uh the use of Aero poisons yeah until that that's great

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:16.020
congratulations you know it used to be it used to be that um people would

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:23.100
openly deny Scholars would openly deny no no they didn't use drugs there's no drugs involved right I just read you an

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:29.279
entire drug passage about antidas to a drug that gets you so high you Babble

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:35.400
and blurt and uh wiggle your tongue like you like you're you just been

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.440
decapitated right and we just discussed the antidotes used to bring those people

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:47.340
back from that edge so were they using drugs wake up

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:53.039
wake up and smell the Opium right but that's old it used to be you had to

00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:58.860
fight against that people say no no they didn't use drugs because they don't want to look at their history in the context

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:04.320
of people using drugs can we really say Augustus who brought the pox Romana that

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:14.159
he was an opium swiller yeah we can you know we can yes scrivonius says so yes

00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:20.520
um but we don't want to say those kind of things now we're at the step now we're at the step where we know this is

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:28.200
the this is the Renaissance this is the Renaissance of the psychedelics this is the toxic

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:34.440
step forward that's always necessary in order to initiate

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:41.720
the spark in order to start the spark the apocalypse that brings that

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:49.860
return that brings that return it's a cyclical mystery right it's death and rebirth

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:55.440
so um I wanted you tonight to see

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:04.620
that there is a tradition that has left behind evidence

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:11.880
good strong linguistic evidence first-hand testimony you can't you know

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.520
you get scribbonius up in the up in trial up in the stand uh there's nothing

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.559
better you know it right out of their mouths you know you can't deny it it's

00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:28.380
right out of their mouths so if uh uh if we are at that point that we are

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:33.900
determining what that crime scene involves with Jesus now we know we know

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:42.360
that the drug side of things goes way back and is heavily influential in a

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:49.620
contemporary in the Contemporary time in a century when he is scrivonius is the early first

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:55.559
century right his exact contemporary with Jesus they probably he probably

00:28:55.559 --> 00:29:01.620
died within a few years not a few years but shortly there after Jesus died to

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:09.000
complete contemporary right so and we have in that contemporary we have the use of these

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:17.640
drugs for the sake of entering into a state of mystery communion

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:24.179
the process of being born again now tonight I thank and I thank you um

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:30.059
tonight I want to finish with two people

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:36.419
with Rob and snappy and before we go to Rob and snappy

00:29:36.419 --> 00:29:42.899
um I want uh Snappy to step up and give us a

00:29:42.899 --> 00:29:47.960
two-minute presentation on some of the things that are going on

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.220
behind the scenes with the Discord

00:29:53.220 --> 00:30:00.360
and what good news we've got from that Snappy go for it all right thank you uh Moon so first off

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:07.679
uh the Discord has reached over a hundred members so thank you everyone for joining and over a dozen of you have

00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:12.840
uh decided to either shave your heads or walk the path of Aphrodite and as a mom

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:18.419
was saying big things are happening right now we are working at establishing

00:30:18.419 --> 00:30:24.000
our very own Temple to the muses first we're looking about doing this online

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.899
um we have Dr Buzzard who's working at making a Wiki and he's right now working on the JavaScript for that and there's

00:30:30.899 --> 00:30:36.980
also been discussion about recreating and developing our own order of the Rose

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:42.120
and the idea behind this would be to organize ourselves and to create a sort

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.820
of fraternity but but without those gender distinctions you know uh we wanna

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:53.399
come together and form a stronger community and create some organizations

00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:59.640
so that we can focus on this like I was speaking to Amon and we want to to have

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:07.260
people who are dedicated to the magic people who are dedicated to archiving this people who are dedicated to

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:12.299
sourcing the mystery directly people who are the who are looking for Medea in

00:31:12.299 --> 00:31:17.760
other cultures and so on there's so much that we can focus on and we'd love it if

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:23.580
you guys all came to the Discord and we were we could all pile together and work

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:30.059
this out and start to organize ourselves a little a little more uh formally

00:31:30.059 --> 00:31:36.480
yeah and excellent excellent and I can't tell you how much

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:42.720
it means to me that the pool of you who are interacting now on this Discord are

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:49.320
so um are so aggressively reason reason

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:56.340
oriented um yeah just good Pagan Satanist

00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:02.640
uh uh you know just the salt of the earth this is this is um this is how it

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.980
should be and I'm I'm truly I'm impressed and humbled so

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:15.419
um Rob now has uh an idea for uh you know ideas for the how the direction of

00:32:15.419 --> 00:32:22.260
the museum can go and what it's my job to do is to step back and let the people who were who were just we have such a

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:28.820
resource of people here that can really help design things and can open up this

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:34.380
virtual space because you know you know the um

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:41.940
that most of us have broken out of Cults and most of us are coming in that

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:48.059
direction as reasonable reasonable sataness and most

00:32:48.059 --> 00:32:55.260
of us are necromancers at heart and want to raise the dead and want to

00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:01.440
um achieve something so people have been asking me what is our goal and what is

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:07.320
our mission and I will just add this if it is anything short

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:13.799
of bringing back lady Babylon then why would we do it why would we do

00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:20.399
it at all Rob what's your vision of a museum tell me what you're working on

00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:27.960
well I love it I've been working on it for a while now put in philosophical teams because I

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:34.200
haven't really I haven't set anything up that is concrete and if I'm honest I need some

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:39.720
help in setting it up but what what I had

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:46.740
well very early days I had the idea of forming another Discord which is more

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:54.120
centered towards these episodes which features the the very the very source is what are in

00:33:54.120 --> 00:34:02.659
the episodes for people who for people who want to go a little bit deeper and focus on the Shaw's material

00:34:02.659 --> 00:34:07.860
that are featured in the episodes just like a specific kind of

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:13.260
nature but of also aware of the fact that that might offend the current

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:21.240
Discord so it's been like a slow progress because the Discord as it is is fantastic and

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:27.358
it's it's not something that you that you could that you could say needs needs

00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:33.000
work it doesn't need any work at all it's not it's not that kind of expression where I'm trying to entertain

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.480
what I'm trying to attain is some sort of special area

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:44.760
for people who really want to engage with the material what are in the

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:54.358
episodes rather than because there's a wide variety of opinions of varied ideas and the

00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:59.880
Brilliance I I haven't got it it isn't like you'd want close that down because

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:05.940
you should look everywhere for all your information now your information should come from random sources all sorts of

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:11.040
sources everywhere what can spark different ideas and that's the nature of

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:17.640
the Discord because you're going to get all these ideas out there and that's fantastic and that goes on that's that's

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:22.800
what's going on but there's also like a more specific side that

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:29.160
I personally want to address I'd like and for for example I'm going to use

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:34.920
tonight for example you know we talk about the the toxins were on the ends of

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:40.859
these arrows and these Arrow poisons and you'll shoot them into some somebody and

00:35:40.859 --> 00:35:46.560
it has this dramatic effect upon them and I won't know is how you get from

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:55.200
that point to rubbing it on something that's shaped like a dildo for an application in a ritual that's

00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.500
where I want to go I want to go into that I don't really want to go

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:09.180
obviously it's a part of it that you want to go broader and you want to see the comparatives differences and also

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:14.940
the the areas out there where are comparative and you you can draw them and you say well these this culture is

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:21.480
doing the same type of thing but that has got its own Forum there isn't a

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:28.920
forum for that specific well you know what's in that toxin that kills you but

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:34.380
can also be applied to the body in another way and that's where I'd like to

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:41.579
focus on to be clear yeah and yeah okay yeah so you can see

00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:49.200
okay this is perfect you can see how Rob focuses in on um kind of a refinement of an academic

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:55.940
type um a branch of this Grand

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:04.560
you see that that that's that that's like people thinking off possessions so it's

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:11.160
like it's known opposition to it's a complementary side approach to an already successful

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:16.859
Discord it's it's not meant as any sort of yeah yeah no I'm not getting what you

00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:22.619
want out of that Discord because you are you you literally are but yeah and we're

00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:28.740
all we're all coming at this from the same start we're all coming at it from the same start so it's just like you

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:35.400
said you need some help and how to design this right that's the Brilliance of what's going on is that it's we're

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:40.680
connecting now these all these minds and expertise now are connecting we're on

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:46.440
the same frequency right the Christians and the Jews and the Muslims

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:53.760
um the Hindus they're going to start doing they're gonna see what we have here and they're going to

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:59.160
start if they haven't already they're going to flood to this because this is the movement people are not going to be

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:05.760
going to buildings right we have to think of the future and the future is

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.820
for us constructing this virtual Temple right we start with this Temple of muse

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:16.980
and we will build a city I know that people are interested in different areas

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:24.720
people want the magic right they want to we have to start a magic class immediately there has to be a specialty

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:31.440
we have to get people to understand the rudiments of necromancy and again not by

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:37.500
preaching not by teaching but giving people the sources by giving people the

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:43.200
sources and saying look don't don't trust me trust what this witch from the

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:49.079
fourth Century said um because that's what we're hearkening back to yeah

00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:54.960
um I think um Rob raises an interesting

00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:01.079
concern though and this is something that I think we need to address is that we need to focus in on certain things

00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:07.680
and we need to have like you were bringing up a moan we need to have sort of designated organizations where people

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:14.460
are focused on specific things like if we can be more organized in our approach

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:20.820
we can have a better way of understanding these things so people who are more dedicated to tracing the

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.980
mystery and what the drugs are and people who are more interested in the magic but we all like you said and we

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:32.940
all need to be doing the necromancy but that's the idea where we're at right now is that the Discord is wonderful for

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:40.140
invoking this freedom and invoking uh our ourselves to just follow the Muse

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:46.140
but it does lack cohesion and what your episodes bring is that cohesion and I

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:52.680
think that's what we need to try and do going forward as we try to make this a little more formal and create our our

00:39:52.680 --> 00:40:00.420
order of the rows is have a more dedicated focus and have people streamlined you know and dedicated to to

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:07.560
specific Pursuits yeah let me let me ask you both this question while we're here and maybe we

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:13.740
can bounce this off the audience somehow um we have a real duty to put together

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:19.619
this scene um and to figure out what Jesus is doing with this naked boy

00:40:19.619 --> 00:40:25.740
um and what are the details of it we have a duty to delve into that we have a

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:31.260
duty to bring that if we're go if we're Bringers of reality right if we're

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:36.480
trying to tell people look what you've been sold as a fairy tale and let me

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:42.480
show you what's actually there in order to open up their to take off their

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:48.060
blinders and to free them if we are really going to perpetuate the bakkick

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:54.599
freedom then we're going to have a mission has to have a mission that's oriented in

00:40:54.599 --> 00:41:04.079
um to those people who are currently um enslaved so we have to be ministers to

00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:10.859
the enslaved do we not oh definitely right but the question is

00:41:10.859 --> 00:41:17.700
how do we how do we approach this too because there's also was a lot of concern on the Discord like um both rat

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:24.540
king and and Dion brought this up is like they're in California they could start a church tomorrow if we wanted to

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:30.720
but you're gonna get a lot of people who are looking for wish fulfillment who

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:36.180
don't who aren't necessarily seeking the same things that we're seeking so we

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:41.460
have to be not exclusive but we have to be careful in our approach right we're

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:46.980
not a church right uh we're trying to invoke the mystery we're trying to bring

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:53.099
that back we're trying to bring lady Babylon back or something new or something different you know

00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:58.320
yeah let me yeah let me elaborate just by saying

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:03.780
um that's why I use the detective um metaphor

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:11.099
um because we're that's all we can do look who are we people are we part of some special Organization no are we are

00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:16.859
we funded by billionaires no um are we uh uh are we some kind of

00:42:16.859 --> 00:42:23.640
special Illuminati no we're just average people who want to know what the reality

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:29.099
is we want to put aside the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with the academics we want to step aside

00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:36.359
from the hoo-ha and from this the sale the wholesale you know shopping out of

00:42:36.359 --> 00:42:41.700
uh the prostitution of History yeah you know what I'm talking about

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:49.520
um we want to we want to put those things aside and we want to just get down to that basic level of the evidence

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:56.460
that's that's what we are um um I would never ever want to start a

00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:04.680
church I would never want to start a church no um or any sort of organization that was

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:10.920
anything beyond a salon of people who were influencing

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:18.240
the world around them by their worship of the muse it's all that matters you know let them

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:24.780
have the world let them have the world Rob what do you think our mission is we're getting we're getting further into

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:29.880
this we're getting further into the into the mystery the more episodes we we're

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:35.700
putting out the more people are becoming accustomed to what what what

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:41.280
you're presenting and that's only ever been my mission to get your work out

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:47.460
there so people can review it and re just just have a look at it from the

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:54.960
for themselves is that a profound effect upon me but that doesn't mean it I'm not every I just want to get it out

00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:01.740
there for everybody to see but also what you can't forget is oh bloody huge this

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:08.160
subject becomes it isn't it I mean we it's very commendable

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:14.599
to want to uh what I want to do is focus in on the episodes and that is

00:44:14.599 --> 00:44:20.220
Monumental in itself you if you go people will know and they will be doing

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:26.460
this and going back through the episodes and then they will be taking notes and they will be looking things up just as

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:33.839
I've done and it you just can't you've got to repeat I'm sure then people will appreciate it

00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:41.220
how huge this unfolds it unfolds and unfolds and unfolds and when you try and

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:47.880
fold it back up into a nice neat little package of explainability it's it's it's

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:54.660
almost ineffable and that's a problem what we face is understanding to go into

00:44:54.660 --> 00:45:00.599
the Mind issue of things is a good thing but also coming out and having this

00:45:00.599 --> 00:45:07.260
overview uh if you if you come out and you look at the overview and you you look at the

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:13.319
subjects You cover with the Mysteries it's enormous I'm I'm

00:45:13.319 --> 00:45:19.200
sure I'm messing up expressing that but it it's what I've found is you think

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:25.619
you're moving forward and you think you're learning a lot and then you realize how little you do know about

00:45:25.619 --> 00:45:31.380
this subject and it's overwhelming that that feeling is because you get to a

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:38.520
certain stage where you think I'm getting comfortable I'm comfortable with this information now and I understand this information then the next piece you

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:43.980
go into it can blow your mind and open up another

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:49.200
call them rabbit holes before you to to explore and that's where I've found

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:54.839
fascinating with your work um and is you need to just start that

00:45:54.839 --> 00:46:00.359
spark get get that get them people to see that initial spark and get what

00:46:00.359 --> 00:46:05.940
you're trying to put across because then you're you're on you're on a roll and

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:11.280
you just go with it and I've been at this for two years been at least for two

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:17.339
years then I don't miss a day a day doesn't go by that it doesn't cross my mind and I'm sure there are people out

00:46:17.339 --> 00:46:22.980
there who are experiencing the same thing and I just think there should be a place

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:28.740
where this can be discussed especially the episodes and the broader

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:34.800
aspects of the Mysteries because you go on the Discord the current Discord is

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.960
it's enormous there's subjects it's fantastic and that's the wide broad

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:47.040
scope of what you can learn and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger it never stops you only realize how

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:53.400
little you know what's your opinion of of that um would

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:59.040
you say that's accurate well I think we're yeah I think deeper than everybody else aren't you

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:04.800
I think we're getting closer if you're walking under that into that Temple and

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:11.940
it says hey Know Who You Are then yeah we're um the more you're

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:19.680
saying oh I don't know and the more you're getting deeper into it the more bakic yeah you're becoming and if you

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:25.440
forget you can ride it on your arm and you can say Bacchus says you don't know

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:30.780
who you are you don't know what you're doing you don't know what kind of life you're living

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:37.319
um if we can get ourselves if we can get ourselves to the point that we're free

00:47:37.319 --> 00:47:43.319
um it's not dependent upon a person or or um any sort of institution or any

00:47:43.319 --> 00:47:50.819
Steward of Dogma it's it's a real Freedom it's a freedom you can't take away from somebody you know you can't I

00:47:50.819 --> 00:47:59.700
don't care what you can tell me now as soon as I've seen Jesus in the garden with the goop on his face and and oh God

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:06.839
take this cup away right and again there's stuff going on there's cops stuff phrase phrase and there's a naked

00:48:06.839 --> 00:48:13.200
Kid ah right and the swords swords Sway and stuff once you've been to that scene

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:22.140
and the crowd is like Kill Em killing and by the way those of you who are writing and saying um you're blaspheming

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:28.079
you're right you're right I am I am in order to

00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:33.420
achieve that breakthrough we have to see Jesus Christ for who he was

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:39.960
he was a man arrested in a public park with a naked boy

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:47.300
when you go to drink of his blood and eat of his flesh you are promoting a

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:54.000
rapist pedophile your institutions or the institutions of rapist pedophiles
