he comes off a little cracked in the head but how would you not be after reading an actual ancient text that

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:35.599
everything we are taught about the past is completely inaccurate yeah yeah that

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:40.760
was nice well I felt a little you know when I read a comment like that I feel

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.880

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:59.560
that okay I I want to ask your opinion Neil a lot of these comments are about

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:06.399
drug use and um was there anything in that interview that made you think

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:13.079
somehow that I was some kind of drug user you even said you're a purist at

00:09:13.079 --> 00:09:21.560
some point there yeah but yeah so and if I had to steal EV for them is they're hearing you saying so much stuff that

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.600
they they're shocked to hear that they're thinking he must be doing the stuff that he's claiming that these

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.640
Greeks are doing but people that actually you know the an ancient Greek sources know that medical was Everything

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:40.000
Medical there was there was there was a there was a gray area between medical and cult it was all sort of you know

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
brought into the same fold where medicine is everywhere drugs are everywhere it's just a part of life they don't even they don't even think about

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.240
it the way we think about it look the cians were not drug users they just

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:59.560
bathed daily in Mists of cannabis um right that's the C and way

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:05.640

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:18.519
first clip let's run the first clip and Neil I want your opinion on this and just boom one sentence it sucks or you

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:23.639
know whatever go ahead so what does this all mean everything you've learned everything we've talked about today all

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:30.600
the drug use and all this cult rituals in the ancient world what what are the uh what would the implications on the

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:36.040
modern world today if we were to be enlightened by this information yeah it

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:42.079
means our religious background is rooted in a guy that we

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:48.440
venerate and that guy was somebody who used

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:57.000
children he was involved with drugs um it's an um a mystery that was

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.720
nothing like going to church today at least I don't think it is maybe somebody's out

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:10.680
there but I don't think it's like that anymore and the fact is we have built a society based on a lie on a complete lie

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:16.199
and it's such a hypocritical lie because the very guy that you've vate I mean

00:12:16.199 --> 00:12:22.320
dude he's arrested in a public park with a kid Danny if you got if you and I got

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:30.320
arrested in a public park with 12 kids what do you think we would be

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:36.720
yeah what do you think I mean um for people who think this is crazy and out

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:43.720
there I actually brought two sources I mean I have more comments that we can go through but since we're on this topic um

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:50.480
somebody reminded me somebody in my comment section when I shared this video right now to my people shout out to

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:57.040
Trent L little he reminded me of something I know you know about this I know you talked about this in the PGM in

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.760
book four um there an actual passage about the naked kid thing can I can I

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.959
pull that up um I have so I'm G I'm going to share screen and I just want to

00:13:07.959 --> 00:13:13.639
real quick just go it's in the Greek Magic app I have it ready to go it's ready to roll right now and as soon as

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:19.079
you pull it up let me know okay can you see that all right I'll read it out to you and if it's if it's uh I I could

00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:24.320
zoom a little go for it I I'm not even gonna put on my glasses read it to me here's what it says this is the English

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:32.000
translation of the Greek PGM 488 through 93 says another to Helios wrap a naked

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.600
boy in linen from head to toe then clap your hands after making him ringing

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:44.720
noise place the boy opposite the son and stand behind him and say the formula I

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:53.600
am Barbaro Barbaro m i pesc yaho Adonai Ela

00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:00.000
Sabo by the way that's what Jesus said on the cross uh sabak koni

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.120
that's those are magical uh incantations and then it says come into this little

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:11.560
one today for I am Barbaro so shout out to Trent little and

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:16.600
the for bringing this to my attention I know we've talked about this verse before but it was perfect because it

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.639
reminds us this is not out what what Ammon is bringing to the table is out

00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:27.560
there in the first century Greco Roman World of Magic um what what are your

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:33.279
thoughts on that and I have one more source that want to go to um the only thought I've got that's right in the

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:40.600
middle of my forehead is that that great Priestess night in the PGM is called the

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:46.839
pederast right so a lot of the magic that you see is going to have and uh

00:14:46.839 --> 00:14:54.120
this pederasty and when you see that the gods you know Sab o right Y and all of

00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:00.839
our you know regular gods that become Yahoo um though those people are there

00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:07.120
right so this is not news to the world I mean it's not like new right they knew

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:13.120
about it back then it was happening and you know it's just the way things were that's the one that's the guy right

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:19.440
there and and it's good good on him and it's actually it's awesome to see other people uh that are looking into this

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:25.959
stuff and finding sources that line up that you could cross reference to so shout out to Trent little on that one

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:33.680
one more source that I want to pull up yeah and then and then I will go back to the comments but this is I think this is also relative we talk about Orpheus at

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.920
the end of his life Orpheus is the high priest of dionis he's the son of Apollo

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:46.160
he is he is the Theologian he gives the apocalypse these are all terms that come from Orpheus and this is what it says in

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:52.199
ID's metamorphosis at the end of his life before the manads are sent to tear

00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:58.240
him apart it says in uh book 10 I think this is stunned by the double loss of

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.000
his wife orus was like that of a coward who saw carus the three-headed dog

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.880
chained by the central neck and whose fear vanished from his n with his nature as Stone transformed his body or like

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.600
olenus and you Lea too proud of your beauty he wished to be charged with your

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:22.040
crime and seem guilty himself once wetted Hearts you are now rocks set a

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:28.680
moist Mount Ida orus wished and prayed in vain to cross the sticks again but

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:35.800
the fairy man fended him off still for seven days he sat there by the shore neglecting himself and not taking

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:43.199
nourishment this kind of reminds me of how the state of Jesus was in at the in the garden sorrow troubled thought and

00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:50.759
and tears were his food he took himself to lofty Mount rodop and hus swept by

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:58.000
the winds complaining that the gods of irus were cruel this is where it gets crazy three times the sun had ended that

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.680
year and water Pisces and orus had abstained from the love of women either

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:09.438
because things ended badly for him or because he had sworn to do so yet many

00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:15.640
felt a desire to be joined with the poet and many grieved at rejection indeed he

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:23.160
was the first of the thracian people to transfer his love to young boys and to

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.880
enjoy their brief Springtime and early flowering this side of the manhood now

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:35.720
we checked the Latin before I don't we don't have time for that right now but there's a there's an argument we made that it says he plucks their manhood

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:42.120
during the early flowering that that this is not the correct translation but I'll let people uh look into that and do

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.160
their homework on that but yeah Orpheus is performing by the way the the thians

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.880
the different voices of responses that we get you get one group that's it's

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:42.000
almost like a thunder struck group and there's a group that's scared right they're the ones shouting this guy's a

do you think we're there how close do you think what spark is it gonna take

00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:26.159
for one of these people to set off the explosion right take that burn that body

00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:32.360
you know what I mean 13 1300 s the fth 14th century is when you finally start

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:38.440
to see the trickling in of sources that are going back to the Greek for example

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:45.919
you get Flavio uh beond Flavio you get um broy and then makell is in the next

00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:52.760
Century right after that and these PE and then plethon comes from Constantinople plethon rewired his

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.960
entire brain I'm reading about this guy plethon everyone needs to do their homework on him he saved civilization

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:03.120
dude brought the Renaissance he him and his wife not I shouldn't just say him

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.880
credit to his wife too they retrained their brains to stop learning Byzantine Greek and Latin and they started talking

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:17.520
and writing in classical adct Greek and they went back to the sources he rejected Christianity he loved Homer he

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.799
loved

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:32.600
helenismo to burn all his books because that's what happened to people like him he knew he saw it happen before him so

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:38.480
he had the smarts to decide I'm going to take all of my work and I'm gonna give it to someone who I can trust that's

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:44.600
gonna preserve it and he goes it to Venice and he brings this is where I said the Venice is where the oh I'm

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:50.080
sorry Florence everyone says Florence is where the uh where the Renaissance sprouted up

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:56.080
right he bring he goes to Florence and he gives all of his work to medich and says don't tell anyone that I gave you

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.159
this save it and get someone to trans it after I die or pass it down and you know

00:24:01.159 --> 00:24:09.200
copy it into a new you know that's how they did it back then before the printing press he does that and guess what happens after he dies Gregory pamis

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:15.279
uh does in fact order the books to be burned and says this guy needs to be erased from history and they thought

00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:20.799
they erased his books but they didn't they survived and then we get the Renaissance right after that you start

00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:27.240
getting you start getting in the Renaissance you start getting paintings of Venus and bakus and Apollo again

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.240
they're bringing the image back into the consciousness of the human be of of civilization that's what yeah and

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:38.600
they're bringing with it Freedom they're bringing with it that that UNR that

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:47.120
unrestrainable freedom yeah love it that adamantine Freedom um love it um and the

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.679
fact that you would bring those Souls here you know just shows people look

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:58.480
this is a war right this is a war that we have had through time and we are

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:04.360
being hit by a wave that will take us back to the Dark Ages um if people can

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:11.640
watch how people are reacting you can you can read the psyche of what's going on hit the next let's see let's see Lady

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:18.120
babyon D is literally one of the greatest things I've oh fantastic where did it teach okay that's we'll look into

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:24.679

00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:30.880
give us the next couple boom yeah can't watch this demon now I think this is

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.120

00:26:00.279 --> 00:26:05.760
thank you for interviewing Dr am and his work is very important to all of us and helps us understand the word of our

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:11.960
prophets and the foundations of our modern religions that's nice that's nice plus it is Delight to hear of a world

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:18.600
where uh the goddess oh this is really why I put this up here was widely worshiped and women were celebrat

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:24.960
healers Scholars besides lovers right um gorgeous that's the kind of stuff when I

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:32.840
see that kind of stuff Neil and I realize people are they're seeing things that you know Inspire them that's the

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:39.360
only reason we're here and um those women uh I really wanted to emphasize

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:47.200
this more and more in satanic initiation but um I wanted to build that base of

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:55.000
modern women who saw the ancient woman that we're talking about and um would

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.039
say holy holy mackerel that's a that's a woman you know what I mean that's a she

00:27:02.039 --> 00:27:08.240
will kick you in the you know oh god let's not get too into that before I get

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:13.799
out of hand give me another one give me look okay now what about these guys and I'm

00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:19.080
gonna I want to know at now what I thought was funny and then I'll let you

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:25.200
um chime in is the fact that it's not just blasphemy Bob long we can have a

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:32.080
debate about who's long and whatnot but this is absolute blasphemy now Bob tell

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:39.960
me something what's the difference between blasphemy really and absolute blasphemy I mean blasphemy is kind of an

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:45.880
absolute thing you know it's kind of like o so it really it makes me think

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:52.200
Bob that you're just I mean just delighting you're just exalting in how

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:58.960
Blasphemous this thing is I appreciate it Bob what do you think Neil you know

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:04.240
Bob is he looks like he's a churchgoing conservative you know

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:10.320
cleancut guy and I think he defiled him I think he he heard some things and his ears weren't he doesn't have the ears to

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:16.880
hear so yeah yeah sorry about that man look in in all seriousness this is a

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:22.640
real reaction right people um there are groups of people that will say oh my God

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:28.880
I thought you were nuts but then I looked up what you were saying and it's actually there right that you're not

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:35.080
making the stuff up and yeah there's that group and then there's the group

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:42.080
that these people would rather burn you alive than even

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:49.799
consider um what you are saying right these are the ones who were throwing the blasphemy and remember just a few

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:55.519
hundred years ago an accusation like this from Bob could get the two of us

00:28:55.519 --> 00:29:01.640
put into a prison right and torture yeah thank you Bob by the way the video

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:07.320
that I'm working on right now that I I have my script pretty much fully written already and I'm recording it now is

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:13.519
about the Dark Ages and so there's Carl Sean was famous Carl Sean the great

00:29:13.519 --> 00:29:19.080
scientist of the last generation he was famous for he came out of a brand new

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:24.600
CBS show called The Cosmos and he said that we had all these great thinkers

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.720
like HIPAA and Archimedes and aatosan and they figured out the Earth's

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:35.320
circumference and all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then all of a sudden after HIPAA is murdered we go

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:41.120
into dark darkness for he's had a thousand years he got criticized for

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:47.320
that by Academia saying that's not that's not actually correct the Dark Ages really weren't as dark as we

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:53.519
originally thought it was actually a pretty good time the Christians were actually pretty cool it's like no F that

00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:59.519
I'm making a video right now and I'm agreeing with Carl Sean and I think the number number one way we can test this

00:29:59.519 --> 00:30:06.840
is the sources what can you compare ID and Virgil and Homer and Aristotle and

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:13.360
hpaa and uh and and uh uh Plato or or

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:20.960
phes or heraclitis parides all these different scientists from the ancient world what can you compare them to

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.399
between 500 you know I'll even let you have a whole Thousand Years between 500

00:30:26.399 --> 00:30:33.640
and, 1500 all right so you can have Dante Dante was pretty good boethus was pretty good okay what else you

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:39.519
got that's it you cannot compare there's no classical sources you got to wait

00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:47.720
till the 17th century before you start seeing Shakespeare and Francis Bacon forget about any listen there's a reason

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:53.440
why and this this author petrarch who I'm reading up on uh uh Renaissance

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:59.279
writer his name is petrarch he coined the term Dark Ages and the reason was he

00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:04.559
literally says he doesn't say science and math or or Warfare or Logistics or

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:09.600
technology he says it's about the sources it's about the classical sources

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:15.039
and he's pointing exactly to what me and ammo were saying that's where the term Dark Ages comes from it's all about the

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:20.080
sources it's all about culture it's all about religion this stuff matters that's

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:27.039
what me and Amma are trying to do we're trying we're not trying to get rid of religion we're trying to trying to save it trying to make it a more of a what it

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:32.320
used to be like where where it's uh it's the Muse that inspires not a bishop in

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:39.519
some church that tells you what to think you can think for yourself that's Freedom it's an expression of the

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:45.919
self exactly know thyself right yeah exactly gorgeous I'm going let's go

00:31:45.919 --> 00:31:53.159
together we put on the right robes we'll celebrate Bonas together I love that I was just reading today about the

00:31:53.159 --> 00:31:58.399
Palatine Church uh excuse me the P the Palatine Library

00:31:58.399 --> 00:32:03.679
and um how how it became what it was and when it was transferred from Another

00:32:03.679 --> 00:32:09.360
Place Another Temple to the Temple of Apollo and etc etc and it was you know

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:16.080
it's strange because you're reading the history of this library and realize the Romans for the hot dwellers that the

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:21.600
Romans were um and you know they switched to Greek what do you think Marcus aelius did everybody's like oh he

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:29.039
wrote his meditations in Greek yeah because he did the same thing that you were talking about he put his brain on

00:32:29.039 --> 00:32:36.960
Ancient Greek and it geared it up yeah yeah fantastic with pus same with dioris

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.440
same with plutar these are all Roman era writers they're all writing in Greek because that's the language you want you

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:48.679
want to write a classic that that wants that's going to be saved forever write it in Greek now oid and Virgil are

00:32:48.679 --> 00:32:54.600
Exceptions there are great Latin writers especially in the Augustine age but let's get real the Greek is where it's

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:59.880
at notice all the scientific I will say this not notice you got the scientific

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:05.279
method coming out of Aristotle's well and then following him you've got

00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:10.440
theophrastus with his botany right he's like the he's like the father of Botany

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:16.279
they call him right I mean um and all of these different scientific disciplines

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:23.200
including the mathematics including all the pharmacology oh my God and you go into the museum this period bleeds into

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.480
the museum in Alexandria and those guys those doctors there

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:35.159
ayrus all of the garans they have the most scientific technical group you can

00:33:35.159 --> 00:33:41.519
possibly assemble at the time you don't find that in any other languages you

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:48.080
don't find it you don't find Calculus why because they're doing it with the at

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:54.279
the level that their language capacitates them to do you don't find that in Latin I'm sorry no for for

00:33:54.279 --> 00:34:00.279
everybody who loves the ancient Romans you know and you like your you like to talk about you know so many people dying

00:34:00.279 --> 00:34:05.760
in combat and stuff like that that's great but the language that they use

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.919
wasn't really capacitated for the Sciences right um but the Greek was and

00:34:10.919 --> 00:34:16.800
the Greek had so overgrown the Mediterranean that Latin

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:23.158
never could then really develop when you read the Latin medical authors and compare them with the Greek it's night

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:29.079
and day it's night and day the Latin medical Works Neil are very very

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:35.480
practical if you see this do this and the Greek works are all about um this is

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:42.280
why the body works this way and this is what you're gonna have to do under these circumstances and you have to reason

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.480
through this and that and it's not really geared um Latin was not geared

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:53.679
towards botany they were still calling plants just you know poea Weare you know you know you know it's funny because

00:34:53.679 --> 00:35:01.760
we're talking about Dark Ages and what or whatnot and what the term means and if it's a legit terminology and O I'm

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:07.560
sorry Galen and Aristotle were the two main science books of Western

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:12.839
Civilization from the second century you know so obviously Aristotle's centuries

00:35:12.839 --> 00:35:18.000
before galin but Aristotle's work gets passed down and updated by people like

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.640
theopus as you mentioned and but it's still the Aristotelian Canon they're calling it

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:29.240
it's still Aristotle's name is all over it and they're updating it but then then G comes along and he writes all these

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:37.400
medical texts and then you have these two pillars of science Galen Aristotle and it stays that way all the way until

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:44.119
basically the enlightenment I mean you talk about the sources that I'm reading uh like broy

00:35:44.119 --> 00:35:49.800
and these guys from petrarch and these people from the 1300s and 1400s and around the time of Fall of

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:54.880
Constantinople they're go they're cting gayin and Aristotle still as if it's as

00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:00.079
if they're contemporaries they didn't update that stuff it just stays and the whole

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:06.319
Arabic the Arabic World speaking world is preserving all of the galenic text

00:36:06.319 --> 00:36:11.359
yeah air style too yeah because they're trying and they're making libraries and

00:36:11.359 --> 00:36:19.119
whatnot too that's where the libraries came and gayen was talking about one his Library got burned down or the storage

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:26.480
area that you know by the 10th Century after the 10th Century Plato was almost lost in the in

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:33.599
the Latin language he's only he only he only survives in Greek then they start translating Plato into Latin in like the

00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:40.280
13th 14th century they even Plato they stopped the Latin language was D was

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:46.520
just like dumbing down in the west but the Greeks were preserving everything was very we're very lucky to have that

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:52.520
yeah medieval Latin blows people I know most class W won't admit that medieval

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:57.920
lighten blows it's like a step down from a step down um amazing work on interview

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:03.760

00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:51.720
views was my prediction I actually had to update that I think it's gonna be more than that because because you

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:57.720
already doubled my expectation for day one and now I have to double that I think you're gonna I think in six s

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:02.920
months from now we're goingon to be looking at a video with multiple millions of views you know you know this

next one this is why the cult of Christ is dying okay people listen to this

00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:01.560
listen to Odin this is why the cult of Christ is dying

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:07.119
it's sick culture it takes a classicist with Dennis Hopper's personality to

00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:13.079
spread common sense I love that I love that look it's somebody who's standing

00:39:13.079 --> 00:39:21.640
back and taking a look at what I'm saying and watching what's happening right that's that's self

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:29.119
investigation good for you Odin that's I give Odin what do you think Neil hey I I couldn't agree more

00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:34.960
fantastic let's get some insults I need some insults cuz Odin's going to pump up

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:40.079
my head if playing over 1,000 hours of Fallout New Vegas has taught me anything

00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:47.240
that this guy is 100 telling the truth about something I thought that was an interesting look you know look um a lot

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:55.119
of people slam uh video games right A lot of people slam them but aren't they just

00:39:55.119 --> 00:40:01.560
kind of a modern novel yeah aren they yeah I I actually think there's the

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:10.440
there's the um possibility that the Muse can Inspire video game creators why not yeah exactly medium to interact with

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:16.440
exactly love it it's the aola the images right love it thank you thank you Elijah

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:21.760
Palmer love it give us the next one oh look at this one this guy is a living

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:28.359
demon do you think he's being serious there maybe maybe I mean I would be

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:35.839
surprised a lot of Christians think that people are are infested with demons now like they do think that I could be you

00:40:35.839 --> 00:40:41.440
know what's funny I could be okay let's just say let's just put ourselves in the

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:50.920
you know let's assume Christianity is true right then maybe you are a demon okay okay number one number one

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:56.440
does it matter and if the answer we just assume it does we just assume it does

00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:02.560
what do we do in this case is there a way to tell I'm telling you the future

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:08.160
because this is what they develop they develop a way to tell who you are when

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:13.200
you're possessed by a demon I love this this is so medieval it's gorgeous give

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:20.839
me another one last one and then we'll go to a clip oh is I just put this one up there for my ego right is this the

00:41:20.839 --> 00:41:25.880
reborn Hunter can you believe somebody said that can you believe shame on you

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:31.400
Matthew where's the whip where's the whip shame on you

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:38.599
Matthew oh that was for me and Hunter Thompson oh genius Hunter Thompson is

00:41:38.599 --> 00:41:45.520
genius right um I'm definitely not give me that that one uh we are truly living

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:53.520
in the end of this version of society when the wise the genius the fools crazy and the pious are all silenced and only

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.839
the wicked and the warmongers are allowed to speak he Blitz me I'd Blitz

00:41:58.839 --> 00:42:04.560
you that's fantastic that sounds like something didn't you like that Neil it sound like

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:11.319
poetry to me it is that's very that's that's very that's a muse that's the Muse right there yeah love it love it I

00:42:11.319 --> 00:42:17.319
love the fact that he talks about genius and this is what is so hilarious um you

00:42:17.319 --> 00:42:24.319
were talking about pleon who he and his wife got into the boat of ancient Greek

00:42:24.319 --> 00:42:31.280
and sailed off to brainville right I can totally sympathize with this

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:37.000
couple um because Neil I got to be honest with you um if I were to show you

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:44.319
my SAT scor you would not be impressed I am a person of average

00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:52.640
intelligence average I wouldn't say I'm a dummy but I'm a person of average intelligence and I can how is it then

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:58.920
how is it that so many comments about genius it's hilarious to watch it happen

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:05.680
because it's not me um it's the Muse and she guides my work and if I need

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:11.079
something she opens it up right in front of me and finds it there's a

00:43:11.079 --> 00:43:19.760
reason that every ancient poet in this Greek ocean starts by

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:25.400
invoking her there's a reason I want you to stop tonight and I want you to think

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:30.640
about the physics of what I am talking about when I look

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:37.800
into the reflection I see her standing next to me that's the

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:43.520
power of the Muse the power to reach out and that's what scares people it's not

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:49.119
me look at me come on seriously Dennis hper first of all I don't look like Den hper you wouldn't be scared of me no

00:43:49.119 --> 00:43:55.200
one's going to see me coming and run right it's silly it's silly I don't know

00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:01.200
your thoughts well you like you said like plethon and

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:07.040
his wife they're they're going to the text and we're going to the thing that

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:12.440
the what's the fabric the medium it is the language that's how you that's how

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:17.559
you express yourself so you can only we can only the Matrix that we're operating

00:44:17.559 --> 00:44:25.559
in is only limited to how we can express ourselves so you isn't wait wait listen to that

00:44:25.559 --> 00:44:32.079
listen to that with the Great IC informant it said because you just got informed listen to that it's the

00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:37.280
language that's doing it he understands exactly what they said the same thing

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:43.760
it's that logos that's the power that drives the universe mother Greek is sexy

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:49.640
they knew they knew the gospels had to be in Greek they couldn't do it Hebrew that wouldn't the logos has to be Greek

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:54.920
but you know what I noticed is that you trying to explain out all of this stuff

00:44:54.920 --> 00:45:02.359
to Danny in English is sort of where the problem lies that's where the Mis that's where the Mis misfiring is happening and

00:45:02.359 --> 00:45:07.880
you would you double double down on that right you admit that's that's what it is

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:15.119
you can't we can't it's hard to even explain it without sounding crazy right

00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:23.160
how do you talk about Jesus Christ arrested in a public park at 4:00 A.M with a naked boy without somebody going

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:30.680
oh what right I'm waiting I'm waiting for somebody to truly depict the scene

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:37.800
of The Garden of Gethsemane I'm waiting for somebody to have Jesus and a

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:43.960
Nanos and I want to see exactly what he's doing with that I wonder if the

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:49.480
word in the PGM in the Greek is syone I think it is syn oh that thing's used all

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:55.920
over andon as well and whenever they say Boone that means it has the purple in it

00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:01.119
it's already Ed isn't that funny a lot of people are seeing the purple stuff

00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:06.319
and they're like oh yeah fantastic by the way Al boy just did a bit on the um

00:46:06.319 --> 00:46:13.160
the purple short segment on the purple because they found it in his backyard was it in your backyard old boy I don't

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:20.960
think so I don't think so it was somewhere it he went to it he took a taxi right okay oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I got a message

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:26.760
from Danny oh fantastic I'm gonna send you a message on actually I can pull it

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:32.319
up I can pull it up he said but I can pull it up right now so it's a a comment

00:46:32.319 --> 00:46:38.680
that he I didn't even read it yet I we're gonna both go into this blind all right okay but you go ahead and uh talk

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:43.920
while I pull this up oh okay fantastic um yeah what was the question that just

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:49.800
came up it was a good one ask about the sacred name of Rome I have said the

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:54.839
sacred name of Rome so many times so many

00:46:54.839 --> 00:47:00.000
times right I've said it I've set it like Minds you'll hit it one of these

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.920
times and when you do you'll be like oh and it'll give you like this feeling you'll understand it's that's how you

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:12.880
use magic names right that's how you use those sacred Powers right this is what

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:19.480
the guys the priests Neil who know the exorcisms will hear what I am telling to

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:26.119
you and they will know that this is authentic that's real and that's why the

00:47:26.119 --> 00:47:32.680
guy's saying hey Danny look out Danny you're gonna let's see if Danny gets possessed got I got the comment right

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:39.240
here all right so this is just by Danny just now he said from Kyle Glazier he says that the Dead Sea Scrolls were

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:44.960
originally written in Greek but I can't find anything that corroborate that claim most of the scrolls are written in

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:53.079
Hebrew with a smaller number of arama in Aramaic or Greek now look what's going on look what's going on okay they found

00:47:53.079 --> 00:48:00.240
a pot with a bunch of stuff bunch of scraps and in those scraps was some

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:08.359
Greek and in those scraps was some Hebrew now the question is which is the original I can tell you

00:48:08.359 --> 00:48:13.960
for a fact the original was the Greek I can tell you for a fact du to one reason

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:19.640
alone the technicality is too high you know what's funny about that too is that

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:25.318
um in the discrepancies between the mauretic and the

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:34.280
at kumran actually lined up more with the Greek and even in the Greek M even in the Greek version you have that yaho

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:42.240
name so there's like it shows that that was the oldest that or it's possibly that could have been an older missing

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:48.000
like whatever septent we have today had to go through this you understand what I'm saying that Mak sense you know

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.359
what's hilarious is that first um in the beginning God created the heavens and

00:48:53.359 --> 00:48:58.440
the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and the words without form and

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:05.000
void in Hebrew are too W boho and too and boho sound like the exact same word

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:12.920
where you just flip the first consonant yes it's exactly what they are and they both mean empty here's the bad thing

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:20.280
neither of the Greek words means empty neither of them and they mean a much

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:27.200
more sophisticated one's a scaffolding imagine this the quantum scaffolding of the universe

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:34.000
right I'm talking 360 Degrees Quantum scaffolding that's what

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.280
the um that the Greek is talking about that

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.520
level of technical uh achievement isn't in the Hebrew the Hebrew it just says

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:50.599
empty and empty too waho right it's terrible and that's what

00:49:50.599 --> 00:49:56.000
I'm talking about people are going to catch up you I'm telling you people the linguists will get into this what we

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.400
don't know when we find scraps one of them in one language and one of them in the other we don't know we don't know

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:08.400
which is which you assume it was the Hebrew because in the

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:15.520
second and third centuries on odomy that is the narrative that was used to help

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:21.559
prop up the idea that the Jewish judeo-christian God because the

00:50:21.559 --> 00:50:28.280
Christians were complicit in this it's a what it is people is it's a lie of

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:36.400
History it's a lie to say the original document was in Hebrew is a Lie by the

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:42.799
way um you made a really good argument when we were talking with uh when we were talking with Derek and Kip the one

00:50:42.799 --> 00:50:49.799
time with the Theo saase is a technical religious term it could mean either

00:50:49.799 --> 00:50:55.839
religious awe it can mean Mania frenzy it can mean Superstition Theos saase God

00:50:55.839 --> 00:51:01.000
inspired right um and you notice how that that term

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.079
shows up in the septu quite often but when you find it in the Hebrew side it

00:51:06.079 --> 00:51:12.680
breaks down into two words it it'll say like God inspired or religious feeling

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:18.880
which means it would be kind of this is a really good point you were making it would be kind of hard to do where you

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:25.640
take two words like that and then Define it and then make it into a technical term it's like you're going backwards

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:33.359
instead of taking a technical term and translating it as God inspired in the Hebrew that was a good point you made

00:51:33.359 --> 00:51:39.599
it's it's obvious that it's an attempt it's an attempt for the language that is

00:51:39.599 --> 00:51:46.319
not powerful to grasp at the language that is powerful and um it's just a

00:51:46.319 --> 00:51:53.200
matter of time before people see that and it kind of blows the whole myth you know just like oh my God you mean this

00:51:53.200 --> 00:52:00.960
is not how no the earliest we have of Moses is the third century and it's in Greek bro just the way it is Embrace

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:08.079
embrace your Greek your your Greek linguistic Heritage right embrace it you

00:52:08.079 --> 00:52:14.200
right if you don't embrace your reality um that's why I think satanic initiation

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:20.960
is so important I just want to say one thing about that that's really you just said people don't realize this okay

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:29.400
Homer when was when did Homer live I don't know 8th Century BC something like that well guess what you we have you can

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:35.040
look this up for yourself look up the cup of Nestor it's an archaeological find of a

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:41.480
cup that has Homer inscribed in it quoting Homer Nestor is one of the home

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:49.200
characters of The Iliad his cup is part of the story there's a cup and on the cup is writing from Homer and it's dated

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:54.240
to exactly the time where Homer's living in so Homer was famous whatever they

00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:00.200
wrote that they made this cup some probably Prince had it somewhere who knows whatever the story is the point is

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:06.160
we have archaeological uh evidence physical evidence that you could touch in your

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:13.799
hand that quotes Homer from the time that Homer lived now Moses on the other hand they say he live in like the 14th

00:53:13.799 --> 00:53:20.400
century BC do you find any archaeological evidence mentioning Homer any Egyptian

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:25.520
records mentioning Homer no um the first time Homer's ever or I'm sorry not Homer

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:32.760
Moses first time Moses has ever mentioned in any sources is in the 300s

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:40.720
BC 320 around there right around the time when Alexandria is being built too by Hackus of abdera before that Moses

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:48.400
has never mentioned and it's so bad that when you have the Jews living in elephantine down in Egypt they fled

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:55.240
there after the year 597 and they stayed there all the way until the year 410 that's when you stop

00:53:55.240 --> 00:54:02.319
seeing papy from that period in that City and in the all that time from 597

00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:08.319
to 410 No Moses no Abraham no um Noah no

00:54:08.319 --> 00:54:17.079
David nothing it's like the text it's like the Torah never existed to them that makes no sense at

00:54:17.079 --> 00:54:26.400
all right I I had somebody today right in note that said um I asked chat GPT

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:33.319
which is kind of cool I give him that um but chat GPT said um we have written

00:54:33.319 --> 00:54:39.119
Hebrew sources from the seventh century um of these sacred texts that are the

00:54:39.119 --> 00:54:45.119
Bible no we don't no we don't no we don't that doesn't right Chad GPT let

00:54:45.119 --> 00:54:50.880
me false objectively false Chad GPT on your

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:57.079
buttocks oh god it feels you know what probably whoever said that probably didn't understand what T was say they're

00:54:57.079 --> 00:55:03.559
probably talking about the melli the melli doesn't mention Moses or or any of those it mentions the kings that lived

00:55:03.559 --> 00:55:10.240
in Israel no one's saying that they aren't real people no he he was saying the Books of Moses and stuff like that

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:16.880
there prophets they only back dat like that because um they it has to be um

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:24.160
earlier on than they than these documents are actually coming from right right it's amazing you know to date the

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:30.960
septu agent you get you get you know Danny Jones asked me a good question he saidhe um can we confirm this stuff

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:36.319
basically is what he told you what he asked me excuse me um and um my question

00:55:36.319 --> 00:55:42.000
my answer is yes yeah right all you need are classicists all you need are people

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.920
who are trained in Greek to look at these texts that's all what's the Style and what period is it they can date it

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:55.880
for you and when they look at it and see what you and I have been looking at you know it's just you know it's a they'll

00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:02.799
catch job we're just you know a few years ahead that's all let's get um another clip let's see critique this

00:56:02.799 --> 00:56:08.440
clip uh Neil the uh give give me some insult give it most importantly what I

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:15.000
want to draw people to is I bring these sources out there in lady Babylon and um

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:22.720
yeah it's my final portrait and um I hope that you know I hope to that people

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:29.240
will be able to appreciate the museum again that people will worship and honor the Muse cuz that's what our society and

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:34.680
our our gorgeous democracy our gorgeous democracy is built on that and I want to

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:41.920
preserve that do you think everyone knowing this stuff and the and basically I mean I if if people accepted this

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:49.200
truth that you claim do you think that that would be a benefit to humanity to know this truth

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:55.000
yeah just like and for the I I assume that um practicing religions would

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.599
collapse right and and cuz who would want to if you knew that Jesus was would

00:57:00.599 --> 00:57:05.839
you really go right would you want to be involved would you want to give your how do you think it would benefit our

00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:14.480
society uh freedom I had a man Freedom yeah comment Neil yeah no uh

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:21.880
like like I said then that this this access to this information will give people the freedom like you said to

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:27.160
choose to follow something that they were lied lied to about and or and it

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:33.200
doesn't necessarily mean the religious religion will collapse it just means we need to restructure what people think

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:39.880
about religion and what were the what was religion in the time of the linian Mysteries like what's what can can we

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:45.520
bring that back what about the S Mysteries what about the frian Mysteries what about the Roman Imperial call the

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:50.640
mithraic Mysteries what about all this other stuff that was going on in this time period give people those options

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:59.039
again we got it you know the Romans had that Cult of Diana it NE nimi and the

00:57:59.039 --> 00:58:06.520
priest that was going to take over for Diana um would have to kill the outgoing

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:13.440
priest and I I think I see some wisdom in that because if you leave

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:20.720
Jesus in power if you leave him in power if you just say well we can reform this

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:26.240
you still have a dude who was arrested at 400 a.m. with a naked kid you still

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:32.000
have that guy um leading the charge and I think that's what the church has done

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.039
for many many years they've tried to kind of just plaster over Jesus so he's

00:58:37.039 --> 00:58:43.400
nice you know look at him that guy wouldn't hurt anyone right he's always ran you didn't see the Jesus who is

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:48.520
there right um God I I hope somebody can can make or the one in Revelation

00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:54.559
remember you and I did a whole video on gangster Jesus yeah yeah yeah I that's a whole different Jesus that people don't

00:58:54.559 --> 00:58:59.920
talk about where he's coming with the and he's saying that he what did he say about the girl at the in the bed or

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:07.319
something that he had remember that part he said I took the put the girl and put her in the bed put her in the bed yeah

00:59:07.319 --> 00:59:12.480
oh yeah for those adulteries that she you know what he's Yahoo's watching a

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:19.319
sex tape you know what I mean that he's constructing himself with his mind seriously who wants to follow this guy

00:59:19.319 --> 00:59:24.760
right this is the guy who didn't know if you put the best looking dude in the

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:32.200
party with the drugs what do you think's going to happen with Eve what do you think's going to happen bad idea the

00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:37.720
groom can never be better looking you cannot have a Henry Caville um standing

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:43.480
next to you when you're getting married you know what I mean you can't it's just it's counter productive right you know I

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:48.920
mean all the love gets sucked out right oh God I love that let's go to couple

00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:55.400
comments and then couple more I won't keep you too long because I didn't want to keep people that long um here's a guy

00:59:55.400 --> 01:00:01.760
who says blank spirituality which I didn't and a life of

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:08.599
introspection which I didn't instead pursue some dirty word all day oh is

01:00:08.599 --> 01:00:16.280
that intercourse probably and all day and blast your brain cells with unrelenting stream of chemicals

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:22.880
naturally the video responses are mostly hell yeah this guy's genius oh first of

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:29.720
all it sounds like somebody's little jelly second of all second of all I don't say

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:35.599
Blast Your Brains now look look I'm I'm gonna have to tell people right I'm

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:41.520
going to have to tell them there are ways in this world there are powers and

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:47.280
don't think that I don't harness those powers do you understand but we follow a

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:54.440
cyan way right everybody what who are you followers of you know what I mean um

01:00:54.440 --> 01:01:01.559
yeah I love that streaming chemicals don't bombard your brain with a stream of chemicals don't do that unless you

01:01:01.559 --> 01:01:08.319
know um those chemicals will help capacitate and bring you to health and

01:01:08.319 --> 01:01:13.839
whatnot and in that case you know bombard I wanna I got I want to pull up

01:01:13.839 --> 01:01:19.200
a verse real quick if you don't mind just want to say I just want to point something out this is what I'm this is what so for anyone who didn't know what

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.760
I meant by that this is this is from the mouth of Jesus himself he saysi have

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:30.319
this against you you tolerate that woman Jezebel who call herself a Prophet by

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:37.000
her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrific to Idols I have given her

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:44.119
time to repent of her immorality but she is unwilling so I will cast her on a bed of suffering and I will make Those who

01:01:44.119 --> 01:01:50.039
commit adultery with her suffer intensely in unless they what the hell

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:56.119
where where did Jes what happened to Jesus letting the adulterer go what what happened to that Jesus he's throwing out

01:01:56.119 --> 01:02:01.359
a bed of suffering yeah so it's like you know those right-wing Christians they got a point dude Jesus isn't the whole

01:02:01.359 --> 01:02:07.559
lydy guy you all thought you know what I mean yeah there's a little bit of disad in them you know what I mean there's a

01:02:07.559 --> 01:02:14.480
little bit and you can see that it manifests itself in the Evangelical psyche now we're now we're drinking

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:21.400
Souls baby right the Evangelical psyche right imagine um you get up in front of

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:26.820
a group and you tell them hey half of you go home

01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:27.240
a David Lynch okay give me a couple more comments Neil let's do these quick because I put too many don't drugs kids

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:34.960
nice give me I'm going to give us couple in a row obviously the DNA of Dennis Hopper there I am that's the blue valit

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:42.799
yeah and steo was combined in a laboratory and the resultant organism obtains its energy not through ATP but a

01:03:42.799 --> 01:03:49.760
crystal meth cycle oh my god listen somebody said I want to ask

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:56.200
Neil a serious question okay take down that silly comment take that down um

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:03.960
Neil I want to ask you somebody said there were a lot of comments about my voice and somebody said I was doing

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:10.440
things with it somebody said that it was bothering him and they just couldn't it was just they had to leave the

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:17.200
room um yeah something about something about my voice that was you know doing

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:24.319
something right um what do you think do you think it's uh how do I I think the

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:29.680
uh the demon possession was getting to them I think remember like the like the

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.920
how you hovered in the room and over the I think that was happening to them maybe

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:40.599
right right yeah I thought it was pretty normal to me so maybe that's just maybe

01:04:40.599 --> 01:04:46.160
they just having a different reaction than me maybe I'm immune to the demons and they're

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:51.440
not all right wait we're back to our our Tha experiment so if I am

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:57.240
demon-possessed I should have some kind of power right and can can we assume

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:04.000
that being able to talk in two different voices at once is a is a thing to go you

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.440
know you can speed it up and you can tell right um who said I was an alien

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:17.400
seriously did you see that there's a conspiracy going couple of people said were're you know he's obviously one of

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:23.400
those aliens and in his earlier pictures is his head is co conical he's got alien

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:31.480
accent even and by the way for the people who said I was from England I'm not and not that that would be bad um I

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:37.520
just I'm not I don't know how you could be more American in your accent than

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:44.079
what I've got going on um so all of those comments I'm wondering what do we

01:05:44.079 --> 01:05:50.920
do with those because you know that's not content and it doesn't matter right those it's just people who are I don't

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:57.039
know you know reacting the the thing that I think we do with that Neil is

01:05:57.039 --> 01:06:03.119
that we um we use it like radar look at what the people out there

01:06:03.119 --> 01:06:08.279
are thinking right flash them with a little sonic wave and it comes back to

01:06:08.279 --> 01:06:15.119
you and how do they react and you can see how some people react some

01:06:15.119 --> 01:06:21.920
people all people have programmed responses so when you are initiating so

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:27.480
I'm addressing my satanic congregation now when you are in initiating you will

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:33.799
be dealing with very specific types when you try to wake somebody up to the

01:06:33.799 --> 01:06:41.760
reality of Jesus with little kids right you're gonna have certain cases

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:48.920
certain types of people give me a couple more let's look at we only have a couple more look at look at what we've got um

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:55.000
how could oh watch this okay Neil this one I want um I didn't get to ask you my

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.680
personal question question but I I'll ask him in a second um look at this one how could Marcus aelia successfully

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:09.559
campaign for most of his life and then spend much of the rest writing about stoicism if he was high on the Opium

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:15.599
most of the time wait a minute wait that is that didn't follow if you're on opium you can

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:21.160
be a stoic all day long because that's what it takes to be a stoic you need to be calm and chill and your heart rate's

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:27.319
got to be down that's what a stoic is a stoic is able to anything's thrown at you you can handle like you a lot of

01:07:27.319 --> 01:07:32.440
opium will make you a stoic exactly exactly cheat code for being a

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:39.359
stoic is being on opium yeah they ran opium to the Spartans once in order to

01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:45.359
because they were all using it you know what I mean and they all were fighting battle so they were wounds and stuff

01:07:45.359 --> 01:07:50.920
like that um yeah if you have an endless supply of opium you can be the best stoic in the world all day yeah and and

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:58.039
remember this is opium that's not been culated into heroin right so it's going

01:07:58.039 --> 01:08:05.039
to be a right it's going to be a different this is not a an opium den Marcus really isn't sitting on his side

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:14.079
and dreaming all the time no no he's using it in a way to capacitate um himself rather than to to

01:08:14.079 --> 01:08:19.120
himself to understand what it takes to be a a a stoic you have to understand

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:24.798
that the mind of Zeus that's the logos is in control and whatever that logos's

01:08:24.799 --> 01:08:31.640
will is is what's going to happen and you don't have any control over it so you have to accept it and play your role

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:37.838
whether you're a slave or you're a pevan or you're a equestrian Warrior or farmer

01:08:37.839 --> 01:08:43.040
or a king you play your role that you were granted by the mind of Zeus you do

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:50.798
it without complaining that is what a stoic is oh doesn't it sound like an opium thing

01:08:50.799 --> 01:08:56.000
sounds if you have opium you're gonna be a great stoic feel good I love it I love

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.798
it now look at the last sentence just because the text is ancient does not mean it isn't a forgery or it's content

01:09:03.799 --> 01:09:10.120
isn't salacious fiction now wait a minute I'm we're talking now do you see how ridiculous this is this dude steps

01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:34.798
prescriptions for Marcus aelius noting that he has to adjust the dosage of

01:09:34.799 --> 01:09:42.278
opium upwards because Marcus rius is becoming accustomed is how they

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:48.560
expressed it accustomed to the drug right this is not salacious fic this

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:53.920

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:40.199
ancient world we forgot about it through the Dark Ages we lost his information but I'm here to Enlighten everybody and

01:12:40.199 --> 01:12:47.920
get and so yeah it is a portal we are we're we're opening up a portal to ancient Athens and ancient El elus and

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:54.159
and Rome and uh and Alexandria so yeah it is a portal yeah definitely

01:12:54.159 --> 01:12:59.880
definitely I want to go back to that mystery that Jesus was involved in that's what I want I just want to land

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:07.679
there in Gethsemane and I want I want to see that naked kid standing there with Jesus and be like just for one minute

01:13:07.679 --> 01:13:14.760
have the have the Insight say what what if you couldn't bring your phone though so no one would believe you that would

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:32.040
phone or something you leave it there or something right I don't know come I saw everybody and they're like where's the F

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.960
like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh man I guess I'm demon possessed again hit

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:44.239
it go ahead hit the clip next one um and then there was the inquiry the formal

01:13:44.239 --> 01:13:51.199
inquiry and it was two I'm told it was two charges number one was demon possession which personally I think

01:13:51.199 --> 01:13:58.760
that's pretty cool that's pretty that's pretty metal no it is yeah number number two it was I was opening

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:04.719
portals to where I don't know but do you think I

01:14:04.719 --> 01:14:11.840
would be a Catholic can you find this is this is this published anywhere yeah it

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:17.920
is I got to finish them so people can have a little sympathy for me I was

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:23.960
fired after the production of the Meda it was wildly successful people said it was the best thing that ever produced

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:30.880
right but I had I had Furious choruses of Catholic University students po

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:36.280
pointing what yes they said they wanted it

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:42.520
accurate so um two things people uh talk about they don't like that there was so

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:49.080
much censoring right they don't like that Danny had to bleep it you know what I mean so that's interesting right

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:54.400
there's a group of people out there who you know are sensitive to that free

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.480
Danny's defense in Danny's defense he wasn't trying to censor you because he wanted to he just

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:04.639
wanted to make sure that the video didn't get uh brought down by the YouTube

01:15:04.639 --> 01:15:10.639
algorithm right if anything he freed you up in a certain way yeah no no no that's

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:17.120
exactly what I thought um he did that he has to dance that dance or um he's not

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:23.280
goingon to get on and I video would not be as many views as it has if he would if he just would have dropped the way it

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:28.800
was it would so bad yeah no no totally totally

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:35.639
reasonable totally reasonable not and and and in his defense as well he's there you have the option if you want to

01:15:35.639 --> 01:15:41.480
go and get the the full gritty version it's out there you know yeah yeah if you

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:47.199
want the full dirty movie go buy it right go buy it yeah yeah and for those

01:15:47.199 --> 01:15:54.239
of you who don't have the money look I'm poor for those of you who don't have the money um to do that look at what I'm

01:15:54.239 --> 01:16:00.199
saying you can see what I'm saying you don't need you don't it you know I mean they left it available enough that we

01:16:00.199 --> 01:16:07.239
can figure out what it means right you know what I mean so um I thought it was great that he laughed in the background

01:16:07.239 --> 01:16:14.320
um Steve I don't know if you caught it but you can hear Steve laugh in the background um over the demon possession

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:20.760
thing but I I want you to see that this is happening again and again this is

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:27.080
part of the initiation there is a static that you will rub up against and that

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:34.520
static produces this demon possession thing right so um it's pretty cool I

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:39.760
think it's I think it is metal to be honest give me the last uh clip sweetie

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:45.800
yeah um nobody is above no nobody's above the Democracy nobody's above your

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:53.000
reason nobody's above the mind that you've been given and that nature is

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.360
your is your mom and um the mystery brings you to a place

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:05.520
where you know who you are that's what it said on the Temple of Apollo it said know yourself

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:10.760
no know yourself right so yeah I think it there would be a renaissance and I

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:16.880
would love it I would love it but you couldn't worship Jesus Anymore you couldn't take the communion way to bring it back full

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.400
circle with what we've been saying this entire time yeah yeah yeah no communion

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:27.679
brother there's no communion anymore cuz how can you right I mean think about

01:17:27.679 --> 01:17:33.960
your morality if you woke up tomorrow and you found out Jesus Christ was a

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:42.600
basically history's kind of awful rotten criminal dude who um was turned into a

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:48.320
power power moving moneymaking um institution that

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:53.560
influenced history and the development of Western Government you know what I

01:17:53.560 --> 01:18:02.120
mean how could you who who is it was it Maki you were reading the other day Neil that said um Christianity screwed up

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:09.320
classical civilization who was that makavelli he that's the that's from discourses on Livy you can go in there

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:15.679
read about what he thinks about Christianity and Roman religion he thought Roman religion was had a better

01:18:15.679 --> 01:18:23.120
understanding of Nature and stuff like that and it gave people something to look forward to every month every month was a new Festival the hararia festival

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:29.120
the floralia festival these different Apollo games came in the summertime every every every month and then

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:34.239
Christianity is like oh we have Easter and we have Christmas and that's it it's like and then you have to have lent you

01:18:34.239 --> 01:18:39.560
have to fast like all there no one want no there nothing to look forward to um

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:46.760
but the point was look you had makii points this out that religion is really

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:53.199
the the the culture that that that keeps civilization gives it a purpose gives it

01:18:53.199 --> 01:18:59.199
some glue to give everybody something to to be connected with um and it's not it

01:18:59.199 --> 01:19:04.960
wasn't just him either all these different Renaissance writers were pointing this out they're saying we live in a time where atheism is on the rise

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:11.239
people don't believe in this religion anymore because it's just pure Dogma it's like forcing you to think whereas

01:19:11.239 --> 01:19:16.639
the old mystery religion didn't really do that you kind of had to have your own

01:19:16.639 --> 01:19:22.560
path that you're on you kind of you got to be initiated or you're not initiated it didn't really matter there's nothing

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:28.719
forcing you to do anything you know yeah could you could you imagine opening your

01:19:28.719 --> 01:19:35.199
eyes to a reality when you've been in this comato state and you thought what

01:19:35.199 --> 01:19:42.440
was going on was real and suddenly you wake up to that reality that lifegiving

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:48.920
spark is what drove these ancient Mysteries and bringing somebody somebody

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:55.440
to that Awakening was their ionic salvation it it makes me wonder

01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:01.920
if we could understand who Jesus actually was we were like everybody just

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:09.920
um puts it down yeah looks like there's too much evidence um he's he's a kind of a creep and he was involved in child

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:18.960
prostitution and um drug use um drugging children um and involving them in Acts

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:27.280
that were um of a cultic of a sexual cultic uh bent um if we could all agree

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:32.960
to that and come to that point you know Danny asked me this question what

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:40.760
happens what's the is that a good thing and my answer to him was really um

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:46.880
inside of my head I didn't say it out very good but inside of my head it was

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:54.040
resounding yes um it's always better to pull toward reason it's always better to

01:20:54.040 --> 01:21:00.920
those natur natural gifts that we have um that logos that we have should compel

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:06.120
us toward reason and not toward faith

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:11.840
and you you even see that dichotomy you see that struggle with Paul he's like

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:18.719
you Greeks you're all about your science right you got to be about faith right

01:21:18.719 --> 01:21:24.000
it's the person struggling to convince somebody that what they're reasoning is

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:31.440
wrong and they have to accept something that isn't natural right that isn't natural the the

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:38.560
the real judge for Antiquity was what was natural right all of these drugs and everything all of these acts that are

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:44.000
going on you know sex is natural that's why they're using it in the rights and

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.639
um yeah it's it's a world that you don't even realize is there I was just reading

01:21:49.639 --> 01:21:56.520
two days a three days ago you know um Danny had to had to pull things you know

01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:04.719
had to cover up certain acts and whatnot but I was just reading two days ago people have asked me um what about the

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:10.719
um virgin breast uh transformative drug and I just came across another example

01:22:10.719 --> 01:22:15.800
of it in gayen um and uh and the boy

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:23.159
who's been uh who's been uniz is there as well um treatment of that area after

01:22:23.159 --> 01:22:29.760
making boys Unix for for the sake of um Sac sacred worship when you brought up

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:35.520
that source to Danny about when they throw the testicles in the house and then whatever house it lands in that

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:41.800
their job was to go and get some women's clothes to bring it to them that's actually so well documented that even

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:48.960
Christian sources write about that you have that in ferus you have that in uh a couple other sources I have that's a

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:54.760
that's there's mad sources for that it was going on all the way into the fifth century until theodosius

01:22:54.760 --> 01:23:00.480
yeah and notice they don't have any exemptions right you cannot object to

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:08.760
that for a kid throwing his testicles into your living room it's okay it's time to get the women's clothes out

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:16.239
objection you don't see people sitting around saying well that's the most unnatural thing I ever seen in my Loop

01:23:16.239 --> 01:23:22.360
right you don't see any of that kind of thing and you think well my God these are Romans and Greeks and they're

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:28.800
embracing this yeah they are hararia Festival which was there during that last week of March when that went down

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:35.280
was one of the biggest festivals in the entire Roman Empire all the way down in Egypt all the way in Rome all the way in

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:42.159
friia they were doing it everywhere so this was a huge event that everyone knew about wasn't just some random one-off

01:23:42.159 --> 01:23:48.600
thing that happened one time this was a thing that happened for 200 or more than that started in 200 BC when they

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:54.639
imported Magnum maer and it goes all the way up until the fifth century when you the Christian authors are still writing

01:23:54.639 --> 01:24:02.520
about it so you have like 700 years of that going down as part of the culture that's crazy that's a big deal yeah yeah

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:08.239
it's foundational it's foundational put the let's go through the last of the

01:24:08.239 --> 01:24:14.719
comments I got a funny verse from Paul gohe go ahead pull this up real quick this just makes me laugh Paul is trying

01:24:14.719 --> 01:24:20.400
to sell Christianity and he's in Thal or he's in Athens right and Paul's now he's

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:27.679
with the big boys now and it says Paul was waiting for them in Athens he was greatly distressed the city was full of Idols so he reasoned in the S so he

01:24:27.679 --> 01:24:33.960
reasoned in the synagogue with both the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks as well as in the marketplace and those happened

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:39.159
to be there a group of epicurian and stoic philosophers began to debate with

01:24:39.159 --> 01:24:45.600
him some of them asked what is this babbler trying to say others remarked he seems to be

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:52.080
advocating foreign gods they said this because Paul was preaching the Good News about Jesus and the resurrection then

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:57.920
they brought him to a meeting of the aegus where they said to him may we know

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:03.360
what this teaching is that you're presenting you are bringing some strange Notions to ideas to our other one says

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:09.520
Notions to our ears we would like to know what they mean and then it says all the Athenians and foreigners who live

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:16.480
there spent their time doing nothing but talking and listening to the ideas um but it's what makes me laugh can I just

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:23.800
say look at that look at that can I just say he's in a place where the people not only they have they have schools of

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:29.600
philosophy ERS but they have people who are willing and ready to engage in

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:37.080
discussions oh God that's what could be more beautiful than that Athenian you know Democratic Heir and it's funny as

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:43.159
they're like What's this babler talking about then it ends with this ends this is hilarious when they heard about the

01:25:43.159 --> 01:25:49.719
resurrection of dead some of them sneered and others says we want to hear you again on this subject uh some of

01:25:49.719 --> 01:25:55.960
them followers some of them believed among was Dian Isis so like basically he he just gets like shut down they're like

01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:02.280
this is weird like all right that's enough of that bye it's like it's just so funny how that I don't know that

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:07.679
story makes me laugh when I hear it I don't know what it is give me the laugh that sounds like the Athenians that

01:26:07.679 --> 01:26:14.280
sounds exactly what the Athenians would do they would go huh tell us about this let's let's see here then they go okay

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:22.040
that's enough of that goodbye and notice that was it the areopagus the hill of Mars where they um conduct the the

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:30.400
earliest Athenian Court was from the areopagus oh yeah um and uh Paul quotes

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:39.000
right so he goes to that thing and he quotes um uh the uh epines quote that

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.560
was originally given by media Paul quotes it right right there because um

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:51.840
he's got some exposure to that literary culture of the Greeks and that's why

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:57.960
when people why when people say that they found pots and there's Greek um and

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:04.480
Hebrew that's why you know those are Hebrew you know what's circulating Greek Greek is the literary language Hebrew is

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:10.440
not right it's not it's not built for it it's not capacitated for it Greek is but

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:17.400
don't worry the Roman scientific stuff blew it totally blew I know people love lucretius and they're like oh the nature

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:24.600
of things that blows compared to Aristotle okay I'm sorry I I say what I think but give me the last couple quotes

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:34.719
and I want Neil there were a couple funny ones here just get give me a oh WTF I want bro did he just say

01:27:34.719 --> 01:27:41.360
Jesus touched little boys and was sipping on the Venom I kind of feel

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:47.679
weird if I write his name I just yelled at my laptop 500

01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:54.719
times because he's convincing okayed that guy's possessed dude

01:27:54.719 --> 01:27:59.960
dude whatever you're taking okay fantastic they said I was taking

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:05.119
something what are you talking about you guys in the audience you're taking things go give me that one this guy

01:28:05.119 --> 01:28:11.400
definitely works with the Jin what did you think about that well I guess if you want to talk about uh the Arabic

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:17.560
translation of demon I guess Jin is the word you go with right yeah I I like the

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:24.080
fact that it's the idea that you can manipulate like the the Jin is there you know and there's certain things you g

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:30.480
rements that can be made and Etc I don't know I kind of like that that's where you get the genie from right Genie yeah

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:38.679
right right exactly I want I want a bottle give me the next one too weird oh by the way're on the

01:28:38.679 --> 01:28:46.199
topic of Genies um there's an Arabic text from the I don't know 700s something like that maybe 800s and it

01:28:46.199 --> 01:28:53.440
talks about an ancient ruin and they in this ancient ruin they found all types of genie bottles and

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:59.119
gold and diamonds and jewels and then they find a text and it says written in

01:28:59.119 --> 01:29:05.679
old ionian characters that's what that's how they describe it old ionian character it's

01:29:05.679 --> 01:29:14.360
Psalms it's not Hebrew it's the book of Psalms and it's written in Old ionian Char Greek isn't that crazy no it's not

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:20.400
crazy because Psalm is a Greek word not crazy at all exactly what David does or

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:27.360
not D it's exactly what orus does he plays a samoy yeah museus it's a song meant for a harp

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:33.719
that's what it means yes exactly did you know that song you know Moses is is

01:29:33.719 --> 01:29:41.119
museus is a songwriter right so that's why you get people ask sometimes why do you have songs of Moses right because

01:29:41.119 --> 01:29:46.880
when Moses's character was invented they were doing it based off the Greek museus

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:53.880
who was a poet that's why that's why so many that's why a lot of Scholars and myself included say that the the nature

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:59.639
of of early Judaism whatever you want to call it septu agent Judaism is orphic by

01:29:59.639 --> 01:30:06.440
nature because it's all it's being performed as songs you get the Psalms you get the Proverbs you get all these

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:11.520
and it's all written in a Cadence it's like that's what that's how the orphic texts were written and by the way the

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:18.880
orphic texts were called apocalypses were called Revelations correct orus was called the Theologian all the technology

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:27.639
all the same technological words that you get in judeo Christianity you find in Al Andria in the oric literature yeah

01:30:27.639 --> 01:30:33.119
why don't people listen to that Neil why don't people listen to of them do some

01:30:33.119 --> 01:30:38.320
of them do Jam Char James Charlesworth is a big big time Bible scholar he's

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:44.920
written about this subject so it's out there it's just not like not you just just not fully absorbed yet it's just

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:50.760
it's just starting to get out there which is a good thing though yeah I think if we look at the underbelly and

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:57.080
we bring out all the underbelly I think people will start I want people to investigate why Peter James and John can

01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:06.000
get away with killing ananas and saf and you say well wait a minute no the Lord smot them okay find that works on your

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.679
fairy tale level but Antiquity was real history right so I want to know how the

01:31:11.679 --> 01:31:18.280
hell they got away with that I understand they convinced their own followers that ananas and saf would be

01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:25.000
in Greedy and keeping gold out of their pockets so God smoted them I understand

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:33.520
your acolyte who is a monest your monest acolyte can be trained to believe

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:38.840
anything right so um I understand them but the people around him weren't the

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:44.840
weren't the pagans standing around weren't they like Jesus did you see those those Christians killed some of

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:51.639
their own people right uh you know don't we get the authorities involved it makes me wonder

01:31:51.639 --> 01:31:57.760
were some of those crucifixions some of that stuff I'll bet you was legitimate you know what I mean like pet

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:05.920
Peter may have gotten what he deserved if you don't follow the fairy tale if you follow the reality it is Peter James

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:12.719
and John killing two people to make a lesson to the acolytes who are nuts that

01:32:12.719 --> 01:32:18.920
if they don't do something they're going to end up like that glory be to God and

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:24.159
um we stand around we look at that it's just like Jesus with his young disciples

01:32:24.159 --> 01:32:31.880
with his young boys we look at that and we don't it doesn't penetrate our brain we see the fairy tale that the that

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:37.280
Christianity is very carefully is very carefully plastered over and oh I love

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:42.880
it the chance to be able to get to tell people this um is our privilege and our

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:49.280
honor Neil and it's a privilege and honor to have um your fellow um

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:55.000
warriorship and uh working with you and tell us real quick about what you're

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:01.560
going to be doing over the next because I want to hear your art like give us a glimpse into the studio video the next

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:08.840
video I'm coming out with is a it's kind of an anthropology video having to do with the what is religion the history of

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:17.440
religion going back I I'm um I'm quoting from petrarch and broy and uh macavelli

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:23.280
what they thought about it at their time period when they were starting to wake up from what seems like some sort of

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:30.000
hypnosis that came over the West for 800 years at that point in time plethon uh

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:37.800
and I'm going through the you know the atmology of the word religio in Latin and then in Greek eia you know and

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:43.400
there's always different words of the there's patas there's fedis uh all these

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:50.239
different words that we would consider to be where we get our word religion from and it's the it's the oath that you

01:33:50.239 --> 01:33:57.360
take it's the awe of the frenzy it's the Devotion to the gods obviously and it's

01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.400
the it's the community of like elus for example so there's a lot of different

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:10.320
factors it's not just one thing it's not just I go I go to a church religion is Christianity or Judaism that's a way

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:16.119
dumb down fixed way to look at religion whereas religion is more about the cult

01:34:16.119 --> 01:34:22.560
the culture where we get the word culture from and that's what I'm getting into it's very anthropological it's going through a lot of history but it

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:27.639
also is going to shake things up because I'm calling some people out some of these modern day religious Scholars that

01:34:27.639 --> 01:34:35.040
are full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you'll see Dan mclin's one of them I wasn't say that but I just I just

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:42.159
slipped sorry no no uh Neil you have to you have to take the LI of reason you

01:34:42.159 --> 01:34:47.800
know what I mean and let me something real quick I'm just gonna give you one little one little I wasn't gonna say

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:54.960
this I was going to wait on this because I don't know how I want to argue this point but this guy wrote an article

01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:03.239
about what is religion and he tries to define religio the dmy of the word he picks

01:35:03.239 --> 01:35:10.119
three random sources where the word religio is used he picks plotus s Cesar

01:35:10.119 --> 01:35:16.960
and cisero now if you go to Perseus tus we call it Ellis you'll see he left out

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:22.080
about 80 other ones so why did he choose those three well they happened to align

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:29.440
with what his argument was he Cherry picks the data that's wrong you don't do that you don't go into uh uh you don't

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:35.320
go into research saying here's what I want to be true now let me find all the data to fix that that's what Dan was

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:42.119
doing in this article so and then he ignores the entire atmology of the word

01:35:42.119 --> 01:35:47.679
AIA which is the Greek word for religion he doesn't even talk about that and how

01:35:47.679 --> 01:35:53.400
you going to ignore the whole Greek side of where we get our religion from how are you going to just go right to the

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:58.560
laat and then pick three words he's he's in trouble for this the way he defines

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.920
monotheism is problematic in my opinion he is uh selectively deciding that

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:09.440
monotheism is just one thing depending on how judeo Christianity looks at it

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:15.480
he's ignoring the monism the presocratic he's ignoring Plato he's ignoring middle platonism he doesn't know what he's

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:20.600
doing it it it seems to me this guy doesn't not know what he's doing he shouldn't call himself a scholar of

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:26.480
religion he should just call himself a scholar of the Hebrew Bible that's all he knows anyways that's that's for now

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:34.080
what's what's strange what's I find strange about that is to use three sources like plotus and Cicero and

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:40.520
Caesar and to assert something about religia the religion and when you use

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:47.600
that word you're talking about old Roman old Roman rights and what is what is

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:53.639
floating in Jesus's helenistic environment is actually the as you said

01:36:53.639 --> 01:36:59.600
the ELA and that's why they're running around talking about Sabah and sabath

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:07.080
because they sabba means to worship it means to recognize those divinities

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:13.080
yeah he's even in the wrong stream right he's in the wrong stream from the

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:19.760
beginning now now you see why I'm having such an issue with this I had I had to rewrite my script because I had to I go

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:26.600
hold on a second this is bad this is really for someone to call it for this is an awardwinning scholar who just won

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:32.320
an award for public he won an award for public facing academic yeah and you you're calling yourself a scholar of

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:38.440
religion you don't even know what religion means right that's like a a that's like a physicist who doesn't

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:43.679
understand who who's never read uh uh Einstein and then just like just going

01:37:43.679 --> 01:37:48.920
off on just some random book they read on on on Twitter or something some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:55.040
that's not a phys you're not a physicist dude stop calling yourself that the the other level of depth that you can tell

01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:01.800
about the person is um you can tell that um when somebody just looked at a

01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:10.239
definition of a word and without having read like I doubt that Dan actually reads plotus no I I I doubt that very

01:38:10.239 --> 01:38:15.960
seriously I'm I'm a helist but I also had to master Latin as well and I can

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:21.239
tell you for a fact that plotus is not easy um plotus is drawing upon some

01:38:21.239 --> 01:38:28.199
older archaic Latin right right now it's only from you know it's not that far back um because those Hut dwellers they

01:38:28.199 --> 01:38:33.760
weren't that advanced but um the the fact is you know Dan doesn't read Dan

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:40.520
doesn't sit around reading plotus and that's what it takes Neil that's what it takes people are this is a good

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:46.159
transition because people are asking me what about um the teaching and what about bringing us in I want to learn

01:38:46.159 --> 01:38:52.040
greatek this requires a commitment when you were reading texts every day you

01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:57.599
were developing a kind kind of a a second sense or feeling you can kind of

01:38:57.599 --> 01:39:03.239
feel the Greek stretched around you you feel where that cozy spaces and you only

01:39:03.239 --> 01:39:09.639
get that by charging through these texts all the time if Dan's reading a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of plotus then you know what we ought to

01:39:09.639 --> 01:39:16.320
do is bring that forward if he's playing a Garian game right not even a good

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:23.480
Garian game like a Byzantine Garian but like a modern Evangelical

01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:28.800
or you know large Church whether it's Mormon or Jehovah's Witnesses or

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:35.080
whatever any of them right any of those monest um it's it feels like he plays

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:40.960
that game um and that's disingenuous man if he's not out there reading plotus

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:46.719
right if he doesn't know Cicero and why it is that cisero is so enamored of the

01:39:46.719 --> 01:39:52.560
Divination of the atrans um you know don't tell me right

01:39:52.560 --> 01:40:00.000
oh God I'm sorry yeah you get in my goat where's penelopy did you bring Penelope tonight let's flash penelopy in the Holy

up with my own talk that I already had with Danny which is being edited right now and check this out it's it's almost

01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:02.159
like a part two because the first qu qu Danny was so shook up from talking you

01:41:02.159 --> 01:41:07.719
he had to ask me questions on what I thought about all this stuff so immediately the whole first hour of our

01:41:07.719 --> 01:41:13.280
discussion was about your discussion so it really is like a perfect part two so

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:19.040
you got to stay tuned and watch that part as well you'll see we go right back to the sources again we talk about Jesus

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:26.000
and the boy in the garden it's all going to be there even me um so you'll enjoy it I also talk about some early dirty

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.599
Christian sources like the borit and Mary being T this is part of the borite

01:41:31.599 --> 01:41:37.560
Gospel that Mary gets taken up onto a h a mountain with Jesus and he says in
