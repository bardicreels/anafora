00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.918
at this furnished with a bow my number two this

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:31.860
one also equals toxicos it also equals the same thing but look at the end of the line

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:38.400
toxic cause salmos toxic salmos

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:46.200
wait the twang of the bow string Psalms and songs and bow strings are all

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:52.500
connected they're all connected in Antiquity you're dealing with the very same entity

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:59.220
you're dealing with the Titans you say what the language it makes sense

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:06.740
the translation she doesn't the Titans those who stretch

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:13.260
heraclitus understood that the Universe was held in the

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.900
tension isn't it amazing that guy was smoking

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:28.799
the universe is held in tension it is that tension that brings you the

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:33.900
seed that tension that brings you the seed

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:39.120
start thinking like an ancient Greek start thinking like an ancient Greek no

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:45.660
yeah think like a pre-socratic yeah fantastic it is that tension that

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:52.080
stretching that brings the seed or the semen it's that tension

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:58.080
okay okay I'm beginning to see Titans Titans are those strainers

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:05.660
they are those powers that maintain that tension

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:12.120
wow okay I'm starting to starting to see some things here starting to see some

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:20.220
some things okay the songs you don't get songs without tension

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:29.100
wait what you can't produce a note without some form of that Plucky tension

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:37.559

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.640
yeah there it is look at this guys take a look take a look at number four

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:30.360
serpents Venom right serpents Venom and we get this reference to job we also get

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:36.900
a reference in the Paula Doris notice by the way at number three uh lxx of course

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:46.080
is Septuagint right it's a 70. right and look look at how bad the maserates do

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:52.260
things are you ready Hebrew Rush a poisonous plant variously called Hemlock

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:59.520
and probably okay stop right there that's how you know this the trans the original is not Hebrew

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:07.260
right variously translators Hemlock or poppy any ancient Roman or Greek would

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:16.020
laugh at that you know the difference between Hemlock and Poppy is like incredible if you were some Monk or you

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:22.860
were some dude who was in a religious order or if you were some dude who was part of an orthodox order

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:28.320
you know what you would do you wouldn't know the difference and so you would throw them together in some garbage

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:34.679
translation that's what you're getting from the mazarites this text is not

00:27:34.679 --> 00:27:40.559
Hebrew it is a very specific Greek and

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:45.960
they couldn't translate it right Julius Africanus is going up to the guys

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:53.820
working on the Hebrew and he says to him he says what are you doing and they you know this is Greek

00:27:53.820 --> 00:28:00.260
you know what you're doing it's back translating this the Hebrew text doesn't exist

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:07.080
ask your Scholars he says a question ask your Hebrew Scholars what this word

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:12.419
means just like a cup was one of common trees he says they don't know

00:28:12.419 --> 00:28:18.059
future conversation they don't know right because they're speaking Greek

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:25.260
Hebrew has been dead for 400 years yeah and they don't have the vocabulary

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:35.340
anymore why they didn't write anything down they didn't write anything down

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:43.679
wow and you mean you thought this text everything that I'm quoting to you tonight you thought was Hebrew look how

00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:48.900
screwed up your perception would be if you put either opium or Hemlock in that

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:54.500
little thing boy it's a good thing we're not magicians or we'd be poisoning ourselves

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:59.520
fantastic okay let's keep going let's keep going let's just keep drilling

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:05.460
we've got a couple more and we're going to jump jump to kneel yeah go ahead uh the end of that translation the long one

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:11.120
I just want oh there's none there's a good one take down the Bible studies people can see this

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:18.240
oh yeah God totally bashed us right he ripped us a new one yeah and he forced

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:25.740
us to drink the hole he forced us to drink the hole because we we

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:32.820
failed in just in front of him just in his presence we failed

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:39.899
we failed so what does he do he gives us the poison what does Hercules do with this stuff what does

00:29:39.899 --> 00:29:45.179
Hercules do let's keep going what does Hercules do yeah

00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:51.299
oh look at that this is somebody else look people where this is from we're going now from a Septuagint to the New

00:29:51.299 --> 00:29:56.700
Testament right hold on you Bible scholars I know hold on I know you're

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:03.000
not used to this because you're used to bs'ing the world you're used to lying

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.700
watch this what they do they gave him wine to drink

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:18.480
with hole huh with hole and mixed in

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:24.260
mixed in and you know some minutes when he tasted

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:31.200
after he tasted it he didn't want to drink it he didn't want that wine a

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:39.899
Sodom he didn't want that he's screaming I'm thirsty and in place of my

00:30:39.899 --> 00:30:46.200
uh from my thirst they give me the oxos

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:52.700
now thank goodness there's a physician and a a medieval

00:30:52.700 --> 00:31:01.740
zoroastrian fruitcake magician who tells us that the um

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:08.100
the antidote in his words the antidote for

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:14.820
um the dips ass Viper is is called oxas

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:20.399
Let's Just Dance what they call it yeah so it makes sense so we're seeing in the

00:31:20.399 --> 00:31:29.220
psalms about druggies getting wasted on Venom so that a dude who is the Christos

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:36.899
can then later sit on a cross and fulfill his mission

00:31:36.899 --> 00:31:44.460
as the son of God right right out of the myth right out of

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:50.100
the cult right out of the history right out of the history

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:56.039
yeah right out of the history hit us within the uh our last I think

00:31:56.039 --> 00:32:02.279
we've got one more here boom yeah hit us with that first one yeah um I wanted you guys to see this I just

00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:07.580
want you to look at the last line look at the EO beloys yeah

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:13.919
send out what does Heracles do with his bows he dips them in the in the holy of

00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:19.140
the serpent right he dips it he's one of these guys who uses those poisons right

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:25.500
and here it is within him this is not a document for us to it's not a musical

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:32.100
it's not some kind of entertainment it's a hymn Meant To Be Sung

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:38.279
during the performance of the mystery okay give me the give me the next one there

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:43.860
um and then finally we're down to Dias Gordy's who's a physician and Dias

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:52.080
Gordy's is going to tell us he's going to tell us what we can do with the Oak and and the acorns that come from and

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:57.480
the oak Galls that he's going to be talking about it yeah he says there

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:05.039
um erratic and their treat kephalale you know headaches and they can be consumed

00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:12.539
or they can be breathed in they can be breathed in now matusai

00:33:13.399 --> 00:33:20.760
and we have some things that are helpful when someone is eating the Ebola wait a

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:26.100
minute when someone's eating what yeah when someone's eating that yobolos

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:31.559
right what is that Yoba loss wait it means shooting arrows yeah

00:33:31.559 --> 00:33:37.799
shedding Venom or venomous animals oh I see look at number two averos poisoned

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:47.580
and we get the orphic hymn to Heracles notice what's poison the Hyma the Hyma

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:53.100
that's that poison Essence that's that poison blood that drink my blood when

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:59.399
lady Babylon gives us the cup right when lady Babylon gives us the cup

00:33:59.399 --> 00:34:06.779
we are drinking that fatal blood that will put us into death

00:34:06.779 --> 00:34:11.898
so that she can resurrect us that's the mystery

00:34:11.899 --> 00:34:20.040
1200 years before Jesus is ever using the word Christ it is not a great it is

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:28.260
not a Hebrew word it is a native pre-hebrew Greek concept think about

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:38.300
that just for one minute what I'm laying down tonight Christos is pre-hebrew cult Greek

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:47.398
pre-hebrew cult Greek it is the state of an oracular child of God

00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:56.158
the oystermania is the state of the Prophet that is the Christos that is the

00:34:56.159 --> 00:35:02.040
Christos okay okay let's look there's one more that I have one more thing yeah

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:07.140
I had one more little thing I just want you to see this little Paul doors just so you don't think I'm I'm bsing you

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:12.960
we're the last word in that first line is the word that's used to baptize right

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:20.640
this is just to die or to cover with a liquid or a gel or a cream to cover

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:26.280
something okay soos and Boston what did he do he

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:32.339
covered his arrows he baptizes arrows in the Holy

00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:38.700
okay that's what he does that's part look at the anthropology again second

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:44.820
line is excuse me he's doing the same thing he's

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:52.800
dipping his Aki whoops is yeah Akita sakidas there it is he's

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:58.600
dipping his projectiles right Akitas I'll keep yeah

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:05.820
[Music] that's a projectile project something with a point comes

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:11.339
comes from the root for point yeah he's dipping them and what in that

00:36:11.339 --> 00:36:18.000
Holy again right it's a very specific use of a very

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.359
specific drug from Antiquity and it is a cult drug so when we find out the

00:36:24.359 --> 00:36:31.500
serpent has so many heads kefla and we're talking about Revelation or

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:37.680
apocalypse we're talking about that dragon with the heads realize

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:44.160
realize what we're talking about we're talking within cult about the communion

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:50.480
fantastic fantastic no problem it's not a flying dragon

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:55.980
I'm sorry to disappoint you but J.R Tolkien is full of it

00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:03.240
right he's it's just kind of it's kind of Mythic masturbation with

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:09.300
just a hint of Norse doo doo right no offense to the north your stuff

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:17.099
is great right but wow we're talking history people we're

00:37:17.099 --> 00:37:22.980
talking history lastly there is a word

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:28.920
in Greek that is the great representation

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:35.760
now is the Greek representation of what um you would call Messiah

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:43.440
and that word is Messias right there was a Greek word for it

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:50.460
yeah what happens when you make a Greek word for a Hebrew word and then claim

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:55.560
that another Greek word is that same Hebrew word

00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:01.619
you're only doing that because you have to fake it you're doing that because you have to fake it

00:38:01.619 --> 00:38:10.099
because you can't explain it Christ is not Messias they are not equivalents

00:38:10.099 --> 00:38:16.440
yeah we have just been reading the text of a bunch of drug using cultists those

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:23.460
who founded your sighting your philosophy and everything about the tiny religions that sprang off as a result

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:31.800
all right Judaism Christianity Islam are The Offspring of this religion

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:39.900
yeah yeah so we're gonna start looking at these

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:46.260
texts and we're going to find every place where our Greek where our Pagan

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:55.440
religion has been washed and whitewashed and sanitized

00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:03.720
so that you get a version of something that doesn't exist I'm going to show you the real religion I'm going to bring you

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.579
to that that

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:17.579
donkey phallus Centaur who's going to teach you about the drugs

00:39:17.579 --> 00:39:23.400
yeah fantastic thank you for your time I want to bring Neil on now I'm sorry to

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:29.520

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:35.880
see you thanks for having me on I can if I if I can just um bring up a few things

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:40.920
I want you said because I couldn't agree more and you that was amazing well said well said

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:46.160
the when we look at Genesis

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:51.660
first of all there's no one citing this text before the ptolemaic times before

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:58.579
Alexandria you never there's no one in Persia no one in Babylon no one in Greece no one in Egypt ever mentioning

00:39:58.579 --> 00:40:03.960
Abraham or Moses or the Genesis story you only start hearing people citing

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:11.220
this text after the 4th Century BCE and it's it's it's like what what's going on here well

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:16.440
if you look at the if you look at the uh the courts of Ptolemy soter and his son

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:21.839
it's Demetrius Valerian who comes from Athens he is the successor of all the

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:28.320
socratic thinkers he's the successor of Plato and Aristotle he's bringing down all that knowledge to Alexandria you've

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:34.859
got barosis the Chaldean coming over here moneto who's citing hecateus of

00:40:34.859 --> 00:40:41.640
abdara where you get your first Moses story and then you have kalamakis the hymn writer who is using baking chance

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:48.180
like hallelujah and amen for pagan gods but not for Yahweh or anything so all of

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:53.280
a sudden you're looking at this court of Alexandria like oh I see what's going on

00:40:53.280 --> 00:41:00.540
here they're putting together like a steroid a religion on steroids right now that's what's happening and so from from

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:06.240
the Greek perspective it's all Native it's all fluid it's like it all flows

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:11.700
you get terms like Daisy domania which means the religious feeling that bakic

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:18.720
revelry feeling which gets translated into the fear of God it means you have to fear God and be afraid of him that's

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:26.400
not what it means it means it does yeah it means fearing God but it means the religious frenzy fearing of God it's the

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:33.060
religious feeling it's that bakic Mania and so when you get when it gets translated from Greek and Hebrew and

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:38.880
then into English or then in the Latin and then into English I should say you lose all the contacts we have no idea

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:46.440
who these people were talking about when you go back and so the the Greek side is where it gets crazy now if I can one

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:52.200
last thing I want to do I I heard what you said about the Christos thing and the oyster Mania

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:57.859
thing and I pulled out some sources if anyone wants to see this is from askilus

00:41:57.859 --> 00:42:04.619
Prometheus bound so I'm going to share three screens real quick and then and then that's it then I'm done the first

00:42:04.619 --> 00:42:10.680
one I want to show the Greek so here it is right here this is the Greek

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:18.480
you notice how this is from Prometheus bound askless uh 566 right it has their you've got

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:23.760
your chance in the beginning there's here's your first word kriya

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:29.160
Korea and then there's your oystros so I'm going to click on this word right

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:36.359
here right this is their Crea now what does this mean now check this out this is going to blow your mind here's

00:42:36.359 --> 00:42:41.880
the real here's the real origins of what a Christ is okay

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:47.400
Creo I clicked on that word here's what it gave me Creo

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:53.820
Korea now we click on the lsj rub anoint all that stuff it's the

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:59.579
anointed right but what's this one down here with the gad fly that's odd Well

00:42:59.579 --> 00:43:04.980
turns out if we go back to ask list this is where it comes from

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:11.040
so I'm going to share them this the last screen I'm going to and then I'll show the translation actually so the uh if we

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:16.880
go back to the Greek text you see this word oysteros Creo

00:43:20.359 --> 00:43:27.180
tessros we click on this oystros and what do we get well let's let's uh let's

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:32.940
switch my screen over to that word right now I'll show you what I'm get what I got here oystros

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:39.359
the gadfly so what is this Korea gadfly phrase happening what's happening here well

00:43:39.359 --> 00:43:45.359
let's do it let's see let's go to the English translation just to speed this up a little bit because we could translate it ourselves which we normally

00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:50.819
do but just for the sake of time let's just see what uh let's just see what Alice has is for the translation real

00:43:50.819 --> 00:43:57.300
quick I'm going to go to the text back to the text uh reveal what this all means and you get

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:04.859
oh ah a gadfly Phantom of The earthborn Argus is stinging me again

00:44:04.859 --> 00:44:10.260
to be stung by the gadfly is the Creo

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:15.480
and this is the first time you see this show up where there's a Christos or a

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:22.440
Creo in any text it's a it's a title and in this case Prometheus is being is

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:27.960
is being stung by the gadfly he's becoming a Christos

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:33.480
there it is I mean we're just pulling out sources here which is not our theories or what we think happened

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:39.079
this is the source so I just wanted to bring that up

00:44:39.079 --> 00:44:45.660
notice notice Neil that it's that gadfly sting that brings that Madness or the

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:51.380
what they called the oyster Mania if you just take that oysters and you look up

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:56.880
oyster Mania it'll tell you this is the state that you enter when you're

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:02.099
prophesying under the influence of the oysters they said the Mania that Mania

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:07.380
that that term has to be in there right it's for profits it's for the prophets

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:16.099
it's what they used we have a reference in diadoris to the cristasa the the

00:45:16.099 --> 00:45:22.740
self-christing of Medea right so when she enters that frenzy in order to do

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:30.000
her thing it's not it's not odd to us that somebody was claiming a title of

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.819
the one who is christed it's not it's not odd at all to us and it it just

00:45:35.819 --> 00:45:43.200
makes great great sense that he's in the shape that he is screaming about is being thirsty and whatnot it's the same

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:49.859
presentation of symptoms so yeah why I wanted you I wanted people tonight Neil

00:45:49.859 --> 00:45:57.180
what did you think about reaching back into abakum um we you know he does talk about the

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:04.260
sotare he talks about the so tear and he talks

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:10.920
about the salvation and we skipped over it but he talks about the one who is

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:16.200
that bringer that that great uh it's it's the first one Chewie bring that up

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:22.380
real quick I need to show people he is the one look at that look at that paragraph uh that second paragraph there

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:29.880
Ryan he's he's look at that first verb [Music] origos is doing he's entering that orgy

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:36.540
in the rivers he's entering that that extreme satiric phase that when your

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:44.880
Tyrion is kicked in and you're standing there with your erection his thumos is in the waters right his what is that

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:50.220
word that's weird hormones from that right

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:56.880
his impulse his sexual drives in that sea why do you think that that where do

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:03.480
you think that power production comes from right and what's funny is the next line says right this

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:12.720
is all from your what you call the Old Testament he says he gets up on his horses and his horsemanship is his

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:19.560
salvation stop if that's not a reference if that's not a reference to the oyster

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:26.160
Maniac horse culture that is the kind of Black Sea civian culture and there's one

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:33.180
group in it right but the group that produces that says hey we're going to change our identity those Aryans and

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:38.280
they change their identity to medes this is that same horse culture that's

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:45.839
spreading these drugs and it is working in concert in the text with the purple

00:47:45.839 --> 00:47:53.640
trade as well so we've got some we've got some things to start looking at if we can what do

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:59.579
you think Neil about I mean this is an Old Testament Prophet how does all that strike you you mentioned because you

00:47:59.579 --> 00:48:06.119
mentioned how there was a paradise and Medea was the queen and we can put it together through the

00:48:06.119 --> 00:48:11.220
primary sources you can too because you you get Medias venerated down in Egypt

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:18.000
she's venerated over in Italy she's venerated and then you've got the medes Horizons says that the needs own account

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.280
of themselves that they used to be called Aryans until Medea came and they

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:29.579
changed her name to the medes because of her that's like there's a lot there's a lot of sources to show that this stuff

00:48:29.579 --> 00:48:37.140
there's historical layers happening here it's not just fairy tale like there's this is some real Bronze Age history

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:42.960
that's being baked into these into these texts maybe that's how they tell the stories I don't know what's going on

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:50.460
here but like there's so there's a layer of truth to this stuff there's a there's an Empire of the mind

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:58.200
you and I have talked a little bit about this there's an Empire the mind and I don't know which one of us first came up

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:05.880
with the idea may have been you and I just called it the Empire of the mind but there is a spread of a mental

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:11.579
culture from from some people would say all the way from India to

00:49:11.579 --> 00:49:16.619
um the edge of Europe right with the oracles up in Brittany some people would

00:49:16.619 --> 00:49:22.859
say it goes all the way that far when pindar trots out his Oracle of Medea and

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:28.020
says that she was sitting on Thera the island as if she is

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:33.599
governing the Mediterranean she is telling people where their future

00:49:33.599 --> 00:49:38.700
Generations will colonize isn't that weird she's telling you in so many

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:44.220
generations your descendant remind them will go should go off to North Africa

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:50.640
build a city called X worship worship there someone they were saying that the

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:57.200
um the people that were living in the masagatai which is probably another way to say

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:04.920
Magog or like the Eastern scythians Gog Magog or massagatai whatever there's

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:10.440
probably different there's probably a hundred different words to say it but in this particular story Cyrus is trying to

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:16.920
go in there and say hey let us marry your let me marry your queen which she already has a bunch of other queens that

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:22.800
he's married to for political reasons so he can have their land basically so he can take their territory use it as a

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:28.500
trading Port whatever and this queen was like hip to it she's like nah we have no Queen but Medea

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:33.720
so that she ended up going to war with Cyrus and she beat him the Jewish

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:39.839
Messiah Cyrus the only person in the whole Old Testament who gets called my

00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:46.859
Messiah finds his end from a queen in the middle of nowhere

00:50:46.859 --> 00:50:52.800
who has no wealth no no power he he goes out in there I think he's just going to

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:58.619
conquer everything and she she ends up with his head in her hand saying and then she takes his head this is what she

00:50:58.619 --> 00:51:06.420
does this is a true this is this is in Herodotus she takes his head puts it in a vas of blood

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:12.140
and then says now you'll never have to thirst for blood ever again

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:19.619
oh I have no Queen but Medea get out of my land like that's some like that's badass

00:51:19.619 --> 00:51:25.559
this is who we're talking about we're talking about the world that no one ever talks about but there's people there and

00:51:25.559 --> 00:51:30.780
there were they were brilliant people too you know very good had very high

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:36.059
culture and everything you know yeah lady Babylon it's something it's

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:41.880
something of history that we just uh it's better covered up it makes us feel

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:48.780
better uh now that we're part of these offshoots Judaism Christianity Islam makes us feel better to kind of mop this

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:55.260
up I was jarring somebody's mind the other day tell me what you think about this Neil with the whole pirate thing

00:51:55.260 --> 00:52:02.040
the lace days right with that second century pirate Queen

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:09.839
um yeah the second century pirate Queen from across the across the

00:52:09.839 --> 00:52:18.780
sea there to on the east side of Italy um yeah and she's uh tuta and she goes

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:24.119
to war with the Romans she's like screw you I don't want you you know you're not going to come out here and tell me what

00:52:24.119 --> 00:52:29.960
to do I'm the pirate Queen well they build a huge Army like the biggest

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:37.500
Point went over there and you know and conquered but people don't see that

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:44.280
they're behind the oracles is a is a whole system of power that is

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:50.880
being exercised in Antiquity and if you don't understand what a pirate Queen is if you don't understand how you could

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:56.520
take somebody you could trade children you could trade drugs and you could

00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:04.079
promote the religion that drives your Society then you don't understand how

00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:10.020
the Bronze Age is put together right I mean it's just uh it's amazing I hope

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:15.180
people can see I hope people can see the big picture Nia was there anything else

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:20.640
that stuck out tonight did you want just to comment on yeah the last thing I was going to say

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:26.160
is um what you see what you're seeing happening in the final centuries leading

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.800
up to the Common Era the time of Jesus uh you're seeing the a bunch of nerds

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:38.700
basically getting together and saying well we have this uh we had this this Empire you know whether it's the

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:44.760
macedonians or Romans doesn't matter because they're both doing the same thing they're both they're trying to create this Universal package of

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:51.839
religion wherein the Bronze Age had an understanding or not even just the Bronze Age you know the uh the age

00:53:51.839 --> 00:53:58.200
leading up you know the Iron Age leading up to Alexander's time all that but like they had an understanding that wherever

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:03.780
you went location-wise if you were in Cyprus you honored Aphrodite if you were

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:09.059
in um I don't know Athens you honored Athena and you had this regional thing

00:54:09.059 --> 00:54:15.300
happening everything was the there was a balance there then as soon as you start getting all these nerds getting together

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:23.160
trying to create these Universal religions like Christianity and Judaism and Islam it just seems like everything falls out

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:30.059
of order it's like there's more chaos from this it just seems like the the it's a failure to try that you gotta you

00:54:30.059 --> 00:54:36.599
gotta let people have their own culture and and and and uh it would just seemed to work better that way

00:54:36.599 --> 00:54:41.880
it makes you think that maybe when they talk about civilization you know and the

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:48.900
value maybe it was something that they saw that they were building there's a freedom in having libraries for example

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:56.579
there's a freedom of having all sorts of temples where all sorts of religious practices can happen right the drive to

00:54:56.579 --> 00:55:01.740
make it the one I mean couldn't you put Neil Jesus and his Apostles and that

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:09.079
group of nerds that you're talking about yeah so the drive to make it that one

00:55:09.079 --> 00:55:17.220
exclusive group tends to be explosive naturally explosive yeah love it love it

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:23.819
I wish that we can reclaim in our in our searches I hope that we can reclaim what

00:55:23.819 --> 00:55:29.280
that Christos really was if we did we could probably understand a lot better

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:34.859
who Jesus was why he was doing what he was doing and why most importantly he

00:55:34.859 --> 00:55:42.180
was arrested in a public park at 4am with a naked kid yeah yeah absolutely Neil I'll give you

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:47.220
the last word thanks for coming tonight all right I'll take the last word the last thing young one of the last things

00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:53.160
young says Carl Young in this famous Red Book it says you need to recognize the

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:58.740
multiplicity of the Gods you cannot unite them into one being

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:04.380
I was thinking about that you gotta let you gotta let there be a diverse culture

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:09.780
you're not just gonna or unify them into one thing that you

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:16.559
want Let Let There Be separations Let There Be diversity you know

00:56:16.559 --> 00:56:22.380
look at the man pulling out pulling out the great cursed Red Book of Carl Jung I

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:29.579
love it where else can you guys get this Neil thanks for coming and I do just want to uh say by the way that Neil's

00:56:29.579 --> 00:56:35.220
working on more videos and I have to say the last one that I saw I was quite

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:43.800
impressed with Neil I mean you're rolling out Blockbusters one after another and I hope I hope that yours is

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:50.339
coming yours is coming soon too I'm almost can you tell the group a little just a minute about what it's about we're

00:56:50.339 --> 00:56:55.740

00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:01.260
it's about Medea so we'll Premiere it sometime we'll get

00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:08.819

00:57:08.819 --> 00:57:15.359
