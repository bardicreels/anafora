be able to come and partake of the offerings which I'll talk about a

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.379

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.300
potential future in the area they want to know who I am and

where I teach let me show you I've made a little video

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.599
it's just a short video but it encompasses some of the headlines

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:57.360
and a couple of images and some nice music from Zane Campbell

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.720
thank you very much Zane and um Chewie roll it I was lost in an

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.040
airport I walked outside onto a golf course

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.280
foreign

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.760
I woke up from the dream I had flown in from somewhere

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:33.680
I didn't know where I was going dreams are kind of like a life sometimes

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.420
they don't make sense I was dreaming about an old love

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:51.200
you were lucky I left you I would have made you miserable

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:05.120
though it broke your heart [Music]

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:13.510
I made it a nightmare but you woke up and I was gone

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:26.120
[Music]

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.670

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.749
[Applause]

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.780
headlines was I'm fired for a phallus yes

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:54.620
um the stage prop that was being used in our bakic performance of the Medea

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:03.479
it was part of the sacking that the association

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.600
for University professors the American Association the aauup descended on the

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.900
University and said not so fast you have done wrong and you have taken a

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.280
man out when other professors approached me and said you're going to be fired I I um

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.460
I had no reason to doubt them but I pressed ahead I pressed ahead with

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.220
bringing them that Medea can can we see the Medea again

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.860
um do we have her image yes this is actually

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.280
um this is actually one of my students and she was the

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.880
inspiration of the play and after my sacking which as you know

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.960
behind the scenes involved an official inquiry by the Catholic Church into my

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.479
state of demon possession and whether or not I was opening oracles

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:12.479
um um portals yeah through oracles yeah fantastic so I

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:18.720
that's where I'm coming from that's where I'm coming from and it was

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:25.199
my honor and duty to the Muse to be able to serve

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:31.680
in that capacity to be able to take students we had great success with our programs with people

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.380
who enter Classics um just because of the work that I was doing and all I was

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.620
doing was showing these texts was opening up this Avenue to these texts

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.280
and so what happens to a person after they are

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.380
fired from a university they end up in a very uh tricky

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:03.180
situation that brought me ultimately to the base of the largest constantly

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:11.100
occupy the the only the oldest constantly occupied City on the planet uh another planet excuse me

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:17.639
um on our continent yeah yeah anyway

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:27.240
um it's a necromantic center a village and um that's how I came to this desert

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.539
um I was I landed here after my termination from the University

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:38.759
I landed here much to the Chagrin of my students and there's a whole

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:46.099
um you can see from the headlines you know it landed our University in the um tops 10

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:52.979
bad universities for free speech and these are it's not a distinction that

00:07:52.979 --> 00:08:00.539
they wanted to earn but at the same time when you point a phallus

00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:07.380
when you point a phallus at someone you bring something from the ancient

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:12.660
world into the modern by means of magic they're

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:18.780
only all these texts are always talking about bringing the future and the past into

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:25.919
the present it's the art of the mogress to be able to do that

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:33.180
it is Magic itself so bringing that power back into the present

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:38.940
is um something that I thought was the goal

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:44.940
and so that's how I oriented my programs and teaching the student that you see

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:52.040
bring her up again please that's such a I'm so proud foreign

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.720
this method actress who thrilled on the stage and everybody

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:04.980
said this was the best thing that this university has ever produced yeah full houses every night sold out

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:10.860
the the counters at the Seminary

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:16.820
um off the charts for dirty internet web uh internet traffic

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:22.200
you know that you hit on when you get stats like that back

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.300
anyway I'm so proud of what she was able to do

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:34.440
she was able to bring that lady Babylon she was able to at that very time when

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:42.480
those fallacies were pointed at the audience and when we brought them the fury you

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:48.060
could hear it crackle in the air you could feel it within the audience

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:54.300
when we brought them the figure of that Fury back and said your greed

00:09:54.300 --> 00:10:00.420
stains your soul with a stench of ruin um that's when we had the victory the

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:06.139
students saw it and the students knew it so when I was fired

00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:12.300
um uh it was uh it was upsetting to a lot of people because what you're doing

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.339
is you're cutting off the the very source that you claim your

00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:24.959
place of your Museum you're supposed to be they're supposed to have access to this information well that student wrote

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:32.160
me she graduated and she went on to act um started her acting career and um when

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.680
she she gave me a note that I have to this day in my jacket pocket people want

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:43.740
to know my motivations and what makes me want to do what I do

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:50.100
um her note said dear Dr Hillman

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.620
you have shown me more of Christianity

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:03.480
than any of my priests could ever do thank you for the education

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.700
and I thought yeah that's why that's why you do it right there

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:15.600
yep so for those of you who are going to be coming to this class tomorrow what I'm

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:22.200
offering what I'm offering to you is a hardcore

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:29.640
preparation for intermediate level reading of ancient Greek this is your hardcore

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:35.279
intensive beginner course I will be more of a drill instructor

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:41.339
than anything to you and you will get tired and you will complain that your muscles

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:46.399
hurt and I had just had somebody in for the first time

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:52.079
and he told me after a after a workout he said I didn't think

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:58.079
it was going to be so tough right um yeah because that's how you have to

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:06.120
be able to burn through what what is piled up over that strength that

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:13.220
inner strength you have to forge ahead with that and that's what I'm here to do is to show you you can see what happened

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:18.779
in my situation you can see what happened and you can

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:25.440
know that I was not going to back down that I was going to bring the

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:34.279
authenticity I was going to bring the muse right and I wasn't going to back down

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:41.220
um there should be no censorship despite what you may

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:48.720
take what you may be willing to endure you should not be willing

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.360
to endure the rape of the muse

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.880
now having said that we have an issue to deal with and that is um there have been

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:06.060
Cersei um has reported to me that there have

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:13.339
been issues with misogyny on this site of all places

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:23.100
for misogyny to be where we study and venerate a woman

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:29.639
we study and venerate a woman if you want to say we we worship femininity

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:35.459
well what kind of misogynists would be welcome

00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:42.779
yeah if we're going to follow the oracles and if we're going to look at that Medea because the real history is

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:48.560
way more interesting than what you're being given

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:56.100
yeah what I'm given the real history is way more interesting when you get down into those texts and

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:01.920
you know that you people know that that's why you want to come tomorrow right the ones of you that want to take

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.320
that route I'm offering you a specialty here I am Ronan you can see that from

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.420
the video I'm on the outside

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:18.420
great job got a lot of attention people said this is real real potential here

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:23.700
and these theories right these theories

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:29.760
um are going to change things yeah yeah and all I was doing was giving him

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:37.320
evidence hey you guys there's a whole bunch of drug books these people are all on drugs right and they're they're using

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:43.500
they're giving their infants opiates right all the time why oh why

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:49.500
slows down your bowels right you get a little diarrhea and take some opium feel better get some sleep

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.959
you know this is part of our culture that's all I was giving them those were the theories the things that they said

00:14:54.959 --> 00:15:03.360
were theories that's what and it's catching up to them it's catching up to them the

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:10.560
the place that we have to go now is we have to say Okay we started the magic I

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:16.620
see The Pact I know what what direction this is going I understand now

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:23.220
that I am in an implicit agreement

00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:30.779
and I will know consciously when pieces of this agreement including what

00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:38.660
I need to do are provided or given and one of those things

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:46.920
is this clothing thing next uh two weeks from now

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:52.440
we will have a Fight Club

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:59.040
yeah it's the get your outfits on Fight Club

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:05.639
Neil will be the champion that one Challenger

00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:12.000
will be able to um to challenge

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.699
yeah now here's the setting

00:16:17.699 --> 00:16:25.320
We are following an a saturnian initiation okay in order to do that

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:33.959
authentically you must follow the Roman legionaries

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:40.259
yeah isn't that Nate this is preserved with them it only makes sense

00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:45.600
it's always the officer Corps who's who's involved in these aristocratic

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:52.259
types of goings-on right we we want that bakkick we want

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:57.360
that common democratic bakunt um worship

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:03.360
yeah we want that Bach fever we want that menatic

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.639
feminine religion

00:17:08.939 --> 00:17:15.660
so um we follow the greatest Greek manly hero that ever lived

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:21.240
and that is Heracles and Heracles

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:27.839
was remanded to the custody of a queen

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:33.600
by the oracle yeah by the oracle

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:39.840
by the Oracle herself so this is pretty serious sentence and

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:46.640
um it is there that he develops the understanding

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:52.740
of the Queen's lingerie

00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:58.440
you know some of you

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:04.740
are delving into the sources now and sending me messages that say oops you

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:10.980
said this I didn't think this was right and there it is right this is a problem that I've had in

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:16.919
the past with a lot of people people always say no no they can't be when I tell you that Jesus Christ is arrested

00:18:16.919 --> 00:18:22.140
in the public park at 4am with a naked boy you're like oh no that cannot be

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:27.660
and then you look it up and then you say it can be and it is and that's my

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:33.299
reality right so um

00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:39.419
what I would like to do what I would like to do is to give you

00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:47.039
access to that initiation pathway and in order to do it

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:52.740
we have to revive that classical gymnasium

00:18:52.740 --> 00:19:00.720
and we are going to do that in two weeks following the heraclion

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:07.320
understanding of the bacchic woman's kit

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:12.900
the minatic kit okay this is the dress

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:19.200
this is the dress of the right and if you are Heracles you

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:29.340
are wearing very nice lingerie very nice this is a queen's lingerie

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:34.620
all right so in order

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:41.640
um you know I could just tell you it's because one of the misogynists snuck on here started saying stuff the pig has to

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:48.059
be sacrificed right this Beast that wandered in has to be sacrificed and now

00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:54.360
we all have to wear the kit of the me net I will be there as

00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:00.679
referee it will be three rounds

00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:04.940
best two out of three

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:12.360
um the first to two Falls is out person by person monoi mono this is

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.700
wrestling right it's a gymnasium and I will present questions to them that will

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:47.220
I was in Israel people have asked me well if you're helping us to go through

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:52.679
this why have you done this before and not yet um very organically my

00:26:52.679 --> 00:26:58.080
initiation happened when I was in Israel and the people in bed were sitting up

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:04.200
and telling me things and then running off the next day crazy like

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:10.980
um when I was there a group of women descended upon me I

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:16.200
don't know it's probably eight yeah and they took me back to their

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:23.059
Dwelling Place yeah and they stripped me of my clothing

00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:29.580
it was the locals were celebrating a festival this is near Armageddon

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:35.700
Tel megido anyway the locals were celebrating a religious Festival

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:41.400
so it was time to go out and dance they stripped me naked

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:48.600
and reassembled my clothing with the kit of a minad

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:53.700
yes they did they gave me a just a gorgeous dress

00:27:53.700 --> 00:28:01.380
and took me out as if we were one big drunken Troop

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:07.500
and the dancing oh the dancing was spectacular the dancing was spectacular

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:13.200
I ended up in the end running like most do I hit him from the

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.779
back and so I ended up um you know running back I found I was

00:28:18.779 --> 00:28:24.240
safe don't worry everything was everything was fine but in the process

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:30.480
of that initiation I realized that I had a tool against

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:37.740
every misogynistic impulse that that I would ever have

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:43.559
yes you see why you need the Balkans you see why you need the mean ads tell me

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:50.520

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:25.320
picture of beauty shoulders rich and fine letting her long

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:31.740
hair Trail into a wine Talons of love the poison tooth of sin

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:37.860
slip and are dulled against her Granite skin she laughs at death and flouts

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:45.059
debauchery those fiends who in their heavy pleasantries gouge and Destroy still

00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:51.899
keep a strange regard for Majesty her body strong and hard

00:29:51.899 --> 00:29:59.279
a goddess her eyes call mortal beings to the

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:04.500
charms of ready breasts between her open arms

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:14.419
she feels she knows this made this Barren girl by our desire fit to move the world

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.779
the gift of body's beauty is Sublime and draws forgiveness out of every crime

00:30:21.779 --> 00:30:28.260

those of you with ears to hear will see her

00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:53.120

00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:01.860
where is that Englishman Rob is Rob here Rob is not here yet um he'll be here in

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:09.899

um we're here at the field of Mars we're here at the field of Mars here he comes

00:31:15.539 --> 00:31:21.059
but before I before we jump we're here at the field of Mars and for those of you

00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:28.440
who don't feel you have any obligation to defend the great mother

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:33.720
to stand between the great mother

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:39.360
and the pollution of this existence right now in Ukraine you and I are

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:46.380
witnessing mothers and children being wiped out being wiped out

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:52.200
we're witnessing Nations stand back and watch it happen

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:59.940
yeah we're watching people justify it there is something that rocks even the

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:06.840
heart of the most stained fascist

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:14.399
and that's the mother we take on the kit of the mean ads

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:22.919
because we honor the great mother yeah yeah we make this this space sacred

00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:27.500
for her Rob how are you doing sir

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.840
oh yeah hi how are you you're right that

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:42.059
was excellent he was uh you know I like hearing about you your history

00:32:42.059 --> 00:32:47.480
excellent story on Israel is that tell megido

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:54.960
yeah and and it was an excellent excavation and everybody knows that on

00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:00.360
two of the nights that I was there people sat up out of bed and said very strange

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:06.299
things and a very strange voice to me it was a powerful experience and a powerful

00:33:06.299 --> 00:33:11.520
place and I will never forget riding horses through the valley of Jezreel

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:18.659
that's that's the way to go rob what do you think about Heracles and

00:33:18.659 --> 00:33:23.820
um his fascination with the kit of the mean ads

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:30.000
profound I always say profound Delta but it says profound dentist it's

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.659
a it's kind of a it's it's confusing to me I'm going to be

00:33:36.659 --> 00:33:42.120
totally honest it's confusing to me um to

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.640
kind of emulate that it's not I mean

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:53.279
I'm not misogynistic by any degree but

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:59.940
you know I I just um I I don't I don't want to come across as an opposition in

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:06.179
this book um scared of it I'm going to be honest about about that I'm scared of dressing

00:34:06.179 --> 00:34:11.220
up in in uh lingerie to be honest with you and

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:19.740
I don't feel like I support support it completely I suppose any expression help you would it

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:27.240
help you Rob it would help you if I told you that right now in Behind These Wars are

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:35.839
people who are killing other people yeah for um doing things like

00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:44.158
dressing up if you're a man like a woman for questioning for questioning gender

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:49.618
um for for looking at masculinity and feminine femininity through a lens

00:34:49.619 --> 00:34:54.658
that's not traditionally accepted that the people you know on you can just say

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:59.940
Georgia right look at Georgia and what's been done

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:06.660
um for the the great mother could you would you could you consider

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:12.119
it for the sake of the great mother oh consider it I I have you know it's

00:35:12.119 --> 00:35:17.760
it's um it's not something I haven't considered certainly don't I don't agree with

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.800
what what people do in in them countries or I

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:28.079
don't agree with that you can't it's really Daft in my opinion and I

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:33.300
don't I don't have much time for it personally uh I I off I often hear of

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:41.040
these things because a work in a place that quite a few guys who come from the European

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:47.520
Community come over and we require them because of the skills that they have and

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.560
um they have these views you know they they do have these views and it's not very nice

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:58.380
I don't you you know in England you can express

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:05.220
your views without having to suffer serious consequences for them but

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:12.359
it's also has an effect on the way people think of you and uh it's it's not a very nice way of

00:36:12.359 --> 00:36:19.619
going about handling oneself in a situation that's it can be it can be that like as you say

00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:28.440
it's devastating it is devastating to be to think people are losing their lives this is such a situational where they're

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:36.180
only expressing it you should be free to express yourself in however you feel like you'd want to that's my opinion of

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:42.839
of matters like I I want I wouldn't be able I want people to be able to express themselves

00:36:42.839 --> 00:36:50.820
freely without any reprise or recalls from in any way shape or form really yeah you

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:57.480
should you still be able to do that express yourself you are you know and be honest with who

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:03.540
you are and share it be proud of it because that is you you know what if we

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:10.920
get what if we get a little more active about it Rob and what if we say it's uh it's almost an obligation of a free

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:16.500
Society to protect it's it's

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:23.579
um it's mothering source to go out and to to prevent the

00:37:23.579 --> 00:37:31.140
destruction of that image the image of the mother um and is that what is Heracles you know

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:36.180
Bears the name of his mother right

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:42.900
Heracles yeah yeah um what she doesn't want right she

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:50.280
doesn't want and there's a whole there's a whole mythology and cult ritual built

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:59.099
around this there's entire temples around these great labors one of which is getting is getting a girdle right and

00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:04.740
in the end Heracles ends up full-grown land breastfeeding from the mother of the cosmos

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:11.099
isn't that nice the the queen of Queens if we're going to bring that queen of

00:38:11.099 --> 00:38:18.060
Queen back in our back into our Trinity cognitively right because this is all

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:27.119
quantum physics that we're doing don't we need to commit to that State of Mind where you and I

00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:35.220
can sit comfortably I need to sit and I want people to know I want people to know I was breffing from the start in my

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:42.060
normal attire and it was Rob who said wait a minute wait a minute

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:47.760
um we're gonna all be dressed in Victoria's Secret but

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:55.380
um you're not right um so Rob I appreciate that and after consultation with the devil and in fact

00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:01.200
you have me you have me on a you know it's a clause within the contract but

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:06.540
it's you know it's something I have to abide by so I'll be there too I'll be

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:11.700
there too and um we want people we want to use this

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:16.920
exercise to show people that um

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:22.020
the mean attic starting point is still living that this

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:28.440
the mystery they said was something that you could bring that was living that was a process and

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:37.320
that this could affect history that's why I keep saying let's bring back lady Babylon she is that operation she is

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:43.560
that all bridging Tower and to bring her back we have to don't

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:49.920
isn't it rational that we have to enter into the state I mean so many medicine

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:57.180
men Native American medicine men can't be that wrong there's something about the necromancy

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:02.820
here that we're trying to bring out and um so I invite people and I'm

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:08.940
inviting people now and I wanted people to see Rob tonight because Rob is as

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:14.820
genuine and as transparent as you can get of a human being he's not trying to hide anything

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:19.859
right he's a lover of the Muse and he will follow her and I know that for a

00:40:19.859 --> 00:40:26.780
fact he'll follow her and he is having a difficult time

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:35.700
yep considering the options yes right so um yeah go ahead I'm sorry you're right

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.740
yeah I'm the way it goes for me is

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:47.820
if this is supposed to be my my path and my way then I'll I'll find out I'll I'll

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:55.140
be I'll be shown there'll be something there'll be a signal or a sign or something that I'll recognize and follow

00:40:55.140 --> 00:41:00.300
for the minute I'm just frightened I'm sure I'm sure I'm not alone I'm sure I'm

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:06.960
not alone in that and I'm sure there's Manny Manu ready to express themselves

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:13.160
then you got me full support complete and full support me uh

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:21.480
I'm like that whether it's your life you know it's um you show myself to see what

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:27.599
happens with so for our our judge will be Cersei our

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:33.060
judge will be Cersei in one aspect I will call the rounds and Cersei will

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:38.220
judge for the sake of prizes and she will do so by polling the audience

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:45.000
by pulling the audience so we will have your your um

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.400
when you become a Marcus and you step up and you're wearing this you're wearing

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:56.280
your feminine kit and you're drawing that attention when you

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:01.980
become that Marcus you will then have the capacity

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:08.220
to enter into

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:14.520
the Ecstasy you will be at the point that your mind

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:19.560
is primed for what the right can deliver it's

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:27.119
again it's not my rules it's just from the past just these texts that are telling us this okay not many detectives

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:33.660
go to the crime scene and put on the Killer's pants right not many of them go through and

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:38.820
stick their finger into the bullet wound right but that's because they wouldn't

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:45.660
want to contaminate it with DNA but that's what we need to do we need to get down we need to get down to the very

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:51.960
basis of what these texts are talking about in order to get there Rob I have to put on the kit

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:59.819
I have to be in that state from the throne now you will have evangelicals who will

00:42:59.819 --> 00:43:07.520
hear that and who will readily understand that we are following the way of Cain

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:14.099
right and are aren't we then aren't we then preparing the place for lady

00:43:14.099 --> 00:43:19.380
Babylon yes right yes if you can get over

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:25.680
and this is the funny thing I started this process and I tell you what I'm frustrated because every one of those

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:33.060
gowns is going to make me look fat every one of them every one of them and I have had a bad

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:39.180
body image for the last 24 hours when I realized what I was going to have to

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:44.339
present to you it makes me the first thing I thought about this morning when I got up is I

00:43:44.339 --> 00:43:51.660
don't want to eat anything right I gotta get ready for this two-week uh and then I stopped myself

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:57.780
and said what what kind of reasoning is this I've put myself into a position that I'm now

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:05.460
reasoning in a way that I don't normally do right in a way that we can smell has the

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:13.020
sense that comes from her coming from her if you are performing testicular tanning

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:20.640
you are never going to fill up with her right it's the wrong direction gentlemen

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:27.660
and who knew that better than anyone the greatest most masculine Greek hero that

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:33.300
walks the face of ancient mythology yeah so

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:38.819
um if you're a Roman soldier and you don't have a problem with this right

00:44:38.819 --> 00:44:47.819
um it's because you respect Heracles and Heracles is the glory of Hera the queen of Queens

00:44:47.819 --> 00:44:53.880
right that that mother that accepts you to her breast

00:44:53.880 --> 00:45:01.680
right you can't get there if you're if you're fascist I'm sorry something blocks you right you can't get there

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:09.359
that mother is a Nazi killer yeah yeah so

00:45:09.359 --> 00:45:15.060
