00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.879
welcome back welcome back I hope every body is doing well

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.320
um thank you for coming to the congregation of Satanist um tonight we'll be looking at a very

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.680
very dirty Bible text but it's an Avenue for us to be able to jump in our

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.400
spaceship and move back through time to that to that period when they were

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.439
having the orgies yeah so I want to be able to find this

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:39.060
place and to take you there and show you and and we're going to do that but in order to get there I need you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.560
hail Satan I need you to be able with me

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.960
to focus on why this is even important so and I'm going to do that with a short

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.560
video I'm going to show you a video and I'm going to have us I'll make a couple of comments on it but I'm doing so to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.000
set up the fact that you don't you never stray from principle one

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.039
which is faith no reason

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.800
number one reason first reason first so we're gonna look at

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.239
these texts but I want to show you something this is going to be this is a clip of a gentleman who is critiquing

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.319
something that has just happened recently um and that is the discussion of Jesus

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.800
on the international stage of Jesus as trans

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.400
I Think Jesus um transgenders himself on a number of occasions and I think if you

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.120
look at the foot washing from John's gospel footwashing elsewhere in both Old and New Testaments that it's

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.959
consistently done by by women and again jesus takes us on people often cast that as being the servant it was the woman's

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.360
role and and Jesus does it and

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.099
it becomes the woman at that point oh boy oh boy we gotta talk about a

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.099
story that you only really seem to get in relation to Christianity because the

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:29.459
world revolutionaries are not brave enough to do this to other people's religions like Islam right we'll talk

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:37.739
about that a little bit later but they tend to do this to Christianity in the wake of tragedy

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.459
what do you want what a job that I don't hate

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.459
is

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.500
that she

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.229
[Music]

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.939
[Music]

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.620
which again he takes his opportunity to express his hate for Christians yes sure they have massive blame the Republican

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.680
party is 100 guilty they have passed over 600 laws against the lgbtq

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.720
community just since 2018. 100 guilty if

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.320
you're a republican you drove this hatred you drove it it's your fault okay

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.479
but it's but my point overall is guys it isn't just the last couple of years

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.960
where they drove that hatred my whole life my whole life right-wing religious leaders have said hey gay people hate

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.259
them hate them hate them oh I I'm not saying hate The Sinner but the sin

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:05.600
they're sinning it is not a god damn sin

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:15.300
so um what do we see there we see a lot of

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.759
people using something to make a lot of different arguments

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:28.740
and you have to realize that unless you can be there unless you can see what's going

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.960
on you can't really you can't really make any statements that

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.080
um individual goes on to talk about is critiquing the situation commenting goes

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:47.460
on to talk uh uh at length about why it isn't possibly correct and in doing so

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.699
he talks about the scholars who talk about trans Jesus now and one of them

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:59.639
came up with a dissertation on uh paintings later much later I mean it's

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:07.280
not even using contemporary evidence so it's it's poor and I've noticed that

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.139
you who have interest in these topics I've noticed that you are progressing

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:18.180
down this path that we're going to see in in the text and in order to do that

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.520
you have to be able to access the genuine if you're going to make a

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:31.020
decision about what is going on now in our society you have to understand the

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.300
past and the only way to do that is through these sources I've watched you

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:43.740
guys I love your comments by the way I'm I'm loving the shirt thing and I'm loving uh

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.960
um I love the guy kudos to the to the guy or gal or hermaphrodite who stood up

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:57.060
last time and said hey um when we initiated brilliant nice

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:02.280

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.560
how it is if you hear someone there there was a

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:32.219
Prof in front of the name or a PhD which they've got their PHD and they're from a big university you assume what they're

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:38.419
saying is accurate I told them Neil you you're being molested by a group of religious

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:44.279
historians Neil religious historians don't work with the texts in the

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:50.279
original you got to go to somebody who's classically trained right you got to go to some hard case

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:55.320
who knows how to read these texts and that's the only thing that I can bring

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.660
to you I can bring you the evidence and hold it in front of your face

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.880
so that you can see it okay let's let's proceed uh thank you everybody for

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:12.000
everybody for joining and um I appreciate your time I I do

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.360

um on command I'll ask you any questions then we can proceed this is going to be

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:30.300
short I don't want to hold us here for a while I just want to Splash it in your face because that's the that's the time

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:36.019
that we've got right um and I appreciate the fact that you're here when you're here

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:42.420
let's look at Ezekiel let's get right in jump right into the the evidence Ezekiel

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.120
please if you'll bring up the text for the evening

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.420
nope

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:02.220
excuse us for not being Johnny on the spot I'm gonna bring

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:09.660
up your text and I'm gonna show you the Greek and I just want to read through with you and show you some words and as

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:18.000
I'm doing so I'm going to bring some images to your brain and those images correlate with the text itself so what

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.660
do I have up here I've got that dirty dirty Prophet Ezekiel and you'll notice right away it's Greek

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:31.680
and the first thing that you will do is you will stand up because you have been listening to the people who don't have

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.560
the training you will stand up and you will say this should be in Hebrew

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:45.740
because your post 10th century when that Hebrew back translation

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:50.600
came into existence and dropped

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:56.700
from the text from the Septuagint you're gonna love this there's dirty dirty

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:03.600
stuff in here oh we've got to we've got to explore this together okay um let's just proceed shall we where

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.360
where the ships come to Halt you know we can all step outside and see what it is

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.880

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:56.399
you'll see this is translated terribly um terribly through the masoretic

00:11:56.399 --> 00:12:03.240
tradition it doesn't use the right word right didn't use uh Adam right it's son

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:10.079
of man interesting title and they they understood this in the first century that's why you know who was going around

00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:06.720
the purple dye from Antiquity is a huge trade it's a huge Trade It splashes

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:12.299
itself all over the languages of the Mediterranean for example Phoenician the

00:21:12.299 --> 00:21:18.960
word Phoenician just means purple right these are traitors and they took

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:25.260
this stuff all over the all over the Mediterranean all over they sit down colonies they influence the language and

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:31.020
the development the language oh God it's beautiful when you consider it for the

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:36.720
delicate history right and remember Greek is a reservoir

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:43.080
this is several thousand Lang years of language and when you get that much development

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:51.659
it's no wonder like the Romans said you know okay the grace goddess with the language right it's a it's you know it

00:21:51.659 --> 00:21:58.860
is the master means of expression you know but we're good at engineering and our language reflects it that's that was

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:06.240
the excuse ride but they all knew they they all they all went over to eluses right

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:11.640

00:29:48.899 --> 00:29:54.000
lot here uh yeah but um yeah he saw them

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.240
let's go down to verse 13. I just want you to see this as young initiates

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:07.279
look at verse 13. yeah okay

00:30:09.659 --> 00:30:15.860

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.980
foreign

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.679
one way walking the one way of the two

00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:43.140
isn't that beautiful yeah so that hold us that way

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:49.799
um when you see that in the first century and Jesus is talking about the way if you don't know those primary

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:55.020
sources you don't even know what the way is right and the example that I always give

00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:02.220
you guys that I want to I I want to finish on this tonight and then take some questions from you

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:09.539
um is that way that we talk about um uh Salvation

00:31:09.539 --> 00:31:15.600
yeah salvation those words we don't have those words those are rich

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:22.140
rich rich rich Greek words so if we're going to say to bring this

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:29.520
back to the beginning if we're going to say that oh as Georgia did

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:36.679
the country the Republic of as Georgia did when people rose up

00:31:36.679 --> 00:31:42.779
and Chase homosexual men and women around and

00:31:42.779 --> 00:31:49.980
killed them as the world tide of this comes this world tide based upon

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:55.200
based upon the very Dogma

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.840
generated by these texts not the text it's not coming from the

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:08.039
text it's coming from the Dogma that's generated by them let's go back and see

00:32:08.039 --> 00:32:15.659
let's go back and see somebody's made the assertion

00:32:15.659 --> 00:32:22.020
that Jesus is trans based on some paintings

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:28.799
if we were to go back and actually look at the sexuality of Jesus if we were to

00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:34.620
go back to the texts we would see

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:40.260
a world that'll crack that'll Crack Your Existence

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:46.260
yeah we'll see we'll catch Jesus in a park um with a naked boy we'll catch him

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:52.080
there and and what is he doing does he have the purple

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:57.659
yeah long story short

00:32:57.659 --> 00:33:04.320
they saw the way they found the way okay

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.779
so now let's get back in the ship come back to modernity does anybody does

00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:15.659
anybody have any questions does anybody have any related to these texts

00:33:15.659 --> 00:33:21.299
