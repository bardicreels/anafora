it to a person over a period of years until they develop to a certain stage

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:52.120

realize that just as the atrans told us um through their

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:28.000
prophets um there is a language that must be used in order to access this era

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.800
yeah and um that language holds the key the heretic stuff is all there because

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:41.920
of that logos that Reckoning the language is bringing the Reckoning the

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:47.160
language is the device for your brain growth it's not just psilocybin or

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:55.520

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:31.599
we get to the point that we can understand half of what they were saying I would be happy if I could understand

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:38.200
half yeah fantastic why because it's just you know it's

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:43.400

Haus there we go tune that vow um it's from Heros which means holy

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:27.000
and the Sigma Lambda muot which in one

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.960
case that we know of is a form of medicine is a form of

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:39.559
medicine interesting do you mean if you go right now and look up the atmology

00:47:39.559 --> 00:47:46.000
atmology ET ettim ET ym etimon right if

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.480
you look up the atmology of Jerusalem you're going to find it's Hebrew and there are guesses

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:58.839
from mishna stuff way later R when it just is sitting there with

00:47:58.839 --> 00:48:06.760
Greek Roots it just is sitting there with Greek Roots something is wrong the

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:13.640
language is topsy turvy it is saying this is no this is older this is older

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:22.240
than you think yeah and um it's later assimilated right as the Old Testament was written

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:27.520
in the 3 Century it assimilated the name back translated it into Hebrew you know

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:33.480
those guys with the Dead Sea Scrolls do you want the secret of what they were actually doing they were sitting there

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:38.079
copying into Hebrew the

00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:45.160
Greek yes and they can't do it CU their language is so

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:52.280
tiny yes it was by then it was lurgical they didn't have a shot they didn't have a shot at it people of course they were

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:59.599
doing the best they could because they were trying to build a tra a tradition some kind of cultural Foundation the

00:48:59.599 --> 00:49:04.640
rest of the world around them had gone into civilization

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:10.640
mode and if you're G to be in this mode at the with the museum in Alexandria

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:15.720
you're gonna have to come up with a foundation right we're scientists we sit

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:23.079
and study these things right so this is when Judaism is really invented it is

00:49:23.079 --> 00:49:29.440
invented then and it is based on on this older mystery cult that comes to us from

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:37.200
the Bronze Age of which this igia this force of the woman is the founder I'm

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:43.440
looking for her I'm looking for that Queen Force I'm looking for it this is

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:50.559
where we're we're going to look all through these texts right until we bring out lady Babylon and let you see the

00:49:50.559 --> 00:49:57.520
most influential woman in all of Earth history

00:49:58.079 --> 00:50:03.599
yeah yeah that's that's who we're looking for let's go let's go to the

00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:09.799
next one we're almost through we're almost through sorry gnostics I'll hurry up here yeah salom may I just want to

00:50:09.799 --> 00:50:14.839
see the medicine there that was andromus as well but I wanted to oh the wolf by

00:50:14.839 --> 00:50:22.240
the way can you just go back to the wolf because I don't want people to miss this um look at this guys look at look at

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:29.920
number um six number six Roman numeral number six nickname of a of

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:36.599
past past right what do you call a past the

00:50:36.599 --> 00:50:41.720
wolf right and is it because of you know we all have weird impressions of wolves

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:49.400
no it's because it's a cult and Cults have symbols that they

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:55.440
use and when I say symbols I do not mean images mental IM

00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:00.599
images metaphors I'm not talking about that I'm talking about

00:51:00.599 --> 00:51:09.040
identification I'm talking about putting two pieces of the puzzle together that match perfectly that is the sumon give

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:14.480
us the next one yep here we go sumon ital each of two halves corresponding

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:20.480
pieces of an AST Gallos or any or other object which two senoi strangers or any

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:26.200
two Contracting parties broke between them okay take it down yeah

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:32.799
so you make a contract you break this thing and it fits perfectly between the two they come together lock and key

00:51:32.799 --> 00:51:39.000
there you are it's proof of your contract it's identification hit the next one hit the next one you're not

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:45.599
going to get this in the Bible School people they don't do this stuff yeah oh what is that AST galus it's a like they

00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:52.599
would use knuckle bones knuckle bones and why why all of a sudden Gunk rat

00:51:52.599 --> 00:51:57.960
woke up um we're talking about sore taste and what are the original sortes used

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:27.839
victorians translate this look at this celebrating of

00:55:27.839 --> 00:55:33.480
Oria okay okay what does that mean what does that mean notice that they're

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:39.799
related there they're related there to dionisis the worship of dianis and that's why I brought you this passage to

00:55:39.799 --> 00:55:47.160
show you look oh is that one nope that one's next go to this one yep oh it's

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:55.480
not now it's further down okay just stick with here let me see hang on this is my fault not chewy um yeah this is

00:55:55.480 --> 00:56:03.520
the passage I had it in the wrong place remember you told me not to do that I'm right right chewy thank you chewy look

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:11.039
uh there's another explanation you know what I mean all the women all the women in this place are

00:56:11.039 --> 00:56:16.920
totally I'm translating are totally enslaved to the orphic

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:23.520
rights they love these oras Mo they they

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:28.640
they really get into the you know to this thing um and they've

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:33.960
been doing it for a long time they call them they clones the MIM Malones that's

what they call them that's aonomus what their what their name is and you know

00:56:39.119 --> 00:56:45.119
they do many of the things that the edoni do and especially they do a lot of

00:56:45.119 --> 00:56:51.599
things that the thran women do the ones that go and celebrate on hyon Mount hyon

00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:57.640
you know what I mean they're all doing the same things and you know I think it seems to me at least that this is where

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:03.160
the verb in Greek comes from it comes from this

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:10.000
crazy extreme cult activity and you know who's worst at this who's worst at this

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.720
is Olympus says the text she is the worstest she's the most Zealot you see that word for Zealot

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:23.440

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:10.880
headbands or the crowns of the women who were there and they I love the last line

got to bring Gnostic on I think that's it let me just make sure that that's um I'm going to go ahead and cut it yeah

00:58:38.119 --> 00:58:45.359
I'm G to go ahead and cut it there um there were a couple other things but um I think it's nice to bring on Gnostic

00:58:45.359 --> 00:58:50.640
informant now chewy let's bring him on welcome Gnostic thanks for having me man

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:55.920
that was cool I kept you for a long time jamack sources and stuff I never even

00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:01.160
heard yet so was good stuff I probably kept you way too long you're probably

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:06.520
you know what it's all right taking a break from some editing anyway it's all good you're about to bring out a new

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:11.680
piece speaking of which you're about to what's your new topic so I'm covering

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:17.680
the first two centuries of Christianity and it's not the so people are told the

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:27.160
the understanding is that there's Proto Orthodox and there's a perfect straight line from Jesus to Paul to Justin Martyr

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:34.760
irenaeus Yus and so forth that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the early Christianity was a

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:41.480
lot more wild a lot more ritualistic a lot more platonist a lot more

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:48.520
Pythagorean orphic Style bakic Style it was very religious a lot of

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:55.440
mania a lot of eucharists a lot of taking substances going out Into the

00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:02.000
Wilderness uh it's dropping out of society having egalitarian societies and

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.480
Cults um with women in charge there's a lot I have a lot of sources proving that

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:13.480
too so I'm going to show people early Christianity is not what people try to

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:19.079
make it as a lot of times people look will back backtrack and say these people

01:00:19.079 --> 01:00:25.119
were Heretics and they always were Heretics everyone always knew this but the the truth is no one knew that these

01:00:25.119 --> 01:00:30.599
people were Heretics these people were revered among Christians popular writing

01:00:30.599 --> 01:00:36.880
texts in Alexandria with funding with uh support and patrons and these were the

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:44.319
early real early Christian fathers and some of these so-called Heretics are have genealogies that bring

01:00:44.319 --> 01:00:50.640
themselves into the so-called 70 Disciples of Jesus for example marcion

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:56.680
is a big one marcion is the first Christian to have a Canon a new

01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:04.920
testament and he according to the sources even the people that hay him say this that he was a student of

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:10.920
thus which is one of the people that Paul traveled with and his father was

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:18.000
filus filus is is is counted among the 70 disciples that actually knew Jesus

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.520
he's one generation away so you'd think this guy would know a thing or two and by the way in his possession is all Paul

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:30.880
PA's letters how does he have all Paul's letters it's not like today where you just can fact stuff around and send

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:38.000
emails you you have a cop if you have a copy of Paul's letters in this early second century you know people that knew

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Paul you're you're right there right you're in that world you're part of that s system of early Christianity so I'm

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.200
highlighting that and then I'm going after I show how the evidence proves this then I go into what did they

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:56.640
actually believe what were they doing and it's a lot of wild what you would consider bakic you know bakic in the

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:03.400
sense that there's they're going through these ecstatic worship ceremonies speaking in

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:10.640
tongues um taking Eucharist and baptisms and going wild and getting the Holy

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:17.200
Spirit like there's a lot of that going on this there there's there's um there I have a whole list of these these early

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:23.559
Christians and like what they what they were talking about what they were doing and that was one of the big ones was

01:02:23.559 --> 01:02:28.920
obtaining the holy Spirit was you would have to go into an ecstatic state of

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:35.799
ecstasy and Mania for for the for the Holy Spirit to possess you and that was important

01:02:35.799 --> 01:02:42.799
that's bigger than anything else so um yeah there I'm gonna show that too yeah

01:02:42.799 --> 01:02:49.960
no I love that I love that um entering the spirit you know what I mean and the all the prophets are doing it you know

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:57.160
what I mean and all the people the priesthood that's getting the voice to speak over the in the Tabernacle they're

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.480
all doing the same thing they're all performing that same mystery it's

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:08.559
fantastic I love it I'm glad that you're I'm glad that you're seeing it I hope you can bring us some dirty stuff you

01:03:08.559 --> 01:03:14.440
got any dirty sex stuff from oh yeah early Christians I got all yeah I got I

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:21.599
got lots of sources about some of their ritual stuff there's Eucharist where Seaman is involved drinking

01:03:21.599 --> 01:03:28.119
semen um good yeah you're going to see it you're going to see it good good I'm I

01:03:28.119 --> 01:03:34.960
can't wait I can't wait so I had you on Neil because I wanted to ask you a couple of questions very specific

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:43.400
questions um number one tell me um what is your estimation of Academia

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:51.240
particularly Bible scholars and the the um investigation of

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:56.680
antiquity what what's your what do you think so because I'm glad you said

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:04.319
specifically Bible studies because I I've been saying this and I'll keep saying it I think Bible scholars

01:04:04.319 --> 01:04:10.480
seminarian uh uh Academia is like not even minor

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:17.480
leagues compared to the major leagues that is Classics right I wouldn't even say it's minor leagues I'd say it's like

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:23.880
high school it's like it's is junior varsity no seriously though I mean like

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:31.119
let cut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like this to get the best get best New Testament scholar you

01:04:31.119 --> 01:04:38.480
can get and their range of like history is just they're not required to do what

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:44.279
Classics are classes are supposed to do and you could tell me with but better experience than me I'm just hearing this

01:04:44.279 --> 01:04:51.440
from talking to people like you and other classicists who are just like they look at the the current state of Bible

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:57.160
studies and Bible SC Academia new test in scholarship and it's just it's so

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:03.880
pigeon hold it's so basic like biblical Greek you have to learn biblical Greek

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:10.920
whatever that means instead of actually like getting into like the attic and the classical Greek you just have to learn

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:15.960
just what's in only you only got to learn the Greek that's in the Bible that's it like there's a whole book on

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:22.319
this like learning biblical Greek and it's just you're literally just learning the vocab that's in the Bible so you

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:29.720
don't even know what these words are analogies are like it's and and and just real quick before you comment on this

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:39.160
and then you hear him talk like I don't want to say names but like there's a big Bible scholar out there who will often

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:45.240
times to explain some sort of um to explain something in the New Testament

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:51.400
right because you can't explain what's going on in the New Testament without having the background of the culture and the history but before it like this

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:58.400
Christianity just Sprout up out of the ground as a a miracle like without any influences from before it right everyone

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:03.680
knows that that's just common sense everything's like that so you'll like this person in particular I'm I'm

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:09.039
thinking of starts um giving an explanation of like some of the DIY Wars

01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:14.880
between Alexanders generals and it's so bad it's they're getting people's names

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:22.079
wrong getting dates wrong like it's like it's not even like it's not even like um

01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:27.640
associates degree level knowledge of this type of stuff like it's like some

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:33.200
it looks like this person just found out five minutes ago from Reading Wikipedia and then extrapolated some stuff and

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:40.000
wrote it down it's just like whoa and like that's your exp this person was comparing

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:47.920
ccus and how he was the son of God to like Jesus I think that's what they were doing and and I just remember just

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:54.880
reading it because I five years ago I would have read that and be like oh cool I didn't because I don't know nothing but now that I'm like actually studying

01:06:54.880 --> 01:07:00.319
the the history the helenistic era DIY Wars you know the antigonid the ccids

01:07:00.319 --> 01:07:05.799
the tmes um th lmus and like getting to know what was going on in that time what

01:07:05.799 --> 01:07:13.039
were these different Cults like what were they doing what was this what was the culture of the time period and then I read something like this and I'm like

01:07:13.039 --> 01:07:22.160
now I know why now I know why classicists laugh at the state of Bible scholars just saying yeah yeah a aimen

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:28.240
to that which is a shame because they have those texts but they um they don't

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:34.039
really belong to them right you have to look at it and this is what troubles me

01:07:34.039 --> 01:07:39.960
because this is what impedes Renaissance is when you take a group of people and

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:45.559
say we're going to control the media surrounding these this evidence as soon

01:07:45.559 --> 01:07:52.960
as you do that you get appropriation right that's why you have people justifying terrible terrible acts

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:59.799
over well you know know God told him to kill all the women in village and that it was for the glory of God um when you

01:07:59.799 --> 01:08:05.720
have a group of people teaching like that um you can guarantee yourself 100%

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:12.520
of the time you're not going to get an accurate look at that evidence it the evidence belongs to us the New Testament

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:17.880
belongs to us it's a human document part of history and right it shouldn't be

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:24.679
separated like it that's what that's what that's what's so crazy about separating classical scholarship

01:08:24.679 --> 01:08:31.679
classical philology from New Testament studies why why why are they separating those two they need to be that this this

01:08:31.679 --> 01:08:37.798
is part of the same classical philology world that it was written in so why are you separating it you don't do that you

01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:43.480
don't take like you don't take Homer and just make it its own thing and then separate it from the rest of the

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:49.600
classical studies why would you do that how would you understand Homer without understanding hiad or understanding you

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:57.080
know the pre like the stuff that happened before like how would you know you would just be just focusing on Homer you'd be so be so pigeon hole and blind

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:02.600
to to understand what's going on yeah exactly exactly and why is it you give

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:09.080
just this material to be guarded by these people who are not into the rest I

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:14.318
can tell you why this is what I think because it it began as a thing that was

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:19.520
controlled by Christians in in scholarship like these these very

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:25.600
Christian universities these Catholic universities dominated that space for so

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:32.920
long and it's it still affects the way it is today even today you get you know classical or um you know PhD New

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:39.199
Testament Scholars that come out of a seminary and they they still have to sign a document saying that they believe

01:09:39.199 --> 01:09:45.960
in Jesus even if they don't they'll just lie and sign it just to get their PHD like why is that even there

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:54.120
still right it's like why why would you have a you couldn't see this in physics or chemistry can you imagine wouldn't

01:09:54.120 --> 01:10:01.040
take a a great astrophysicist and say you know what all your work is great your math is straight on nice articles

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:07.080
nice books um but you got to sign this statement because we only want you to

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:12.480
present this material a certain way it's total control yeah and that's why Julian

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:19.760
is saying this has to stop and I don't think people realize Neil this is why I was so you know this is what really gets

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:25.159
my goat is is when do we have can we bring up the goat now put him on too

01:10:25.159 --> 01:10:32.320
there he is there he is this is what really gets my goat um is the fact that

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:39.199
this material is being essentially altered to be presented to you in a way

01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:48.320
that some group wants you to understand it right the reality is being fed to you

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:55.040
through a lens and all you got to do it's all you got to do is shadow that lens shadow of that lens and stand back

01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:00.080
and look at the text look at the text and do what a scientist would do just do

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:06.360
what a scientist would do and look at the evidence and say what do these words mean and where do they come from and all

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:13.400
of a sudden when you start doing that the whole propaganda that started with the

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:20.880
early church and I'm not talking about the freaks who were on drugs I'm talking about the reformers the church fathers

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:28.640
cury guys who were trying to put control trying to put that horse you know a bridal on that horse right yeah yeah

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:34.920
real quick let me jump in and say something about that because the the the case that these so-called gnostics are

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:41.080
trying to make for themselves being the legit Christians was that they are doing

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:47.800
exactly what Jesus and Paul are doing they're getting their Divine messages from the Holy Spirit through

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:53.639
inspiration that's correct that's biblically correct this the the her

01:11:53.639 --> 01:12:00.199
ologist or they call him Proto Orthodox I hate that word there's no such thing you're looking back and then you're

01:12:00.199 --> 01:12:06.280
classifying him as Orthodox because they won so these Proto Orthodox people you

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:13.159
know what they you irus actually says this that Authority only comes from a

01:12:13.159 --> 01:12:19.120
bishop because the bishop is the Living God on Earth where where do you that is

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:24.199
so against the message of Jesus that it's not even funny the guy that's walking around talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to Pharisees

01:12:24.199 --> 01:12:31.800
and Sadducees because they're all obsessed with the law and they're obsessed with authority and having the high places and the you think that makes

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:39.000
you that's why would that be the case but it so it's like how did how did someone with that message win out

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:46.120
because it fits like a glove for a Roman Imperial religion you're not going to let some guys that are taking getting

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:53.120
ecstatic speaking in tugs taking drugs and getting the message from the holy spirit in control of your cultural uh

01:12:53.120 --> 01:13:00.159
Norm forms you're going to have some guy well dressed in his nice robes and he's got his well written books NE next to

01:13:00.159 --> 01:13:06.120
him and he's you know he's got Bishops in all these different cities that he can like write to and set things up with

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:14.440
it's way easier to control it's way more uh the legistics of it makes way more sense but and for me personally the idea

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:19.880
that oh we're right because we have Bishops and Bishops have authority

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:28.040
because they're Bishops over oh we're right because we're getting the Divine message from the Holy Spirit like that

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:33.880
is making a lot of sense to me right whether you like Christianity or not this is beside the point it has

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:40.880
nothing to do with the video what I'm doing is I'm just saying within the Christian World here's what we're looking at yeah yeah you know I mean

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:46.679
yeah I totally get what you mean and I know that that's why Becka Deli um was

01:13:46.679 --> 01:13:54.360
doing what he was doing he was trying to break through that Authority and say look you know we're humanists

01:13:54.360 --> 01:14:00.080
you you know you don't influence us and he tried to write about the very heart

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:07.719
of the mystery and it was so much for that control structure that um they they

01:14:07.719 --> 01:14:14.960
uh it some one gentleman um said people blamed the

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:22.840
Reformation on the examination of the hermaphrodite seriously seriously your

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:29.120
mind is that small right it's I just can't believe it Neil it's um we're

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:36.080
going to be swallowed if if we're let me finish with this question for you if if

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:44.840
we are in a period following a Renaissance that followed Dark Ages that

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:51.760
followed the height of Roman civilization if we are in a period That's following that Renaissance and

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:58.440
that enlightenment do you think now in society that we're going forwards or

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:06.320
backwards are you gonna where are you going to put put us on the scale of you know progress towards classical

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:13.880
civilization or um turning away from it where are we well we're turning I would say this

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:22.199
we're turning away from those dark ages of the church being in control of every facet of society even during Reformation

01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:28.040
days it's it's like either you're a Lutheran or a Catholic or a calvinist or maybe you live in England you're an

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:34.679
Anglican and they control all facets of society coming into the Americas and the

01:15:34.679 --> 01:15:40.239
French the French were contemporary with the Americans on this um was the idea

01:15:40.239 --> 01:15:48.159
that we need to get away from this this system and allow you know freedom of religion stuff like that so going I

01:15:48.159 --> 01:15:56.000
think that and that's and that's reverting back to the classical age of the democ Ry of Greece of having your

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:04.239
own personal mystery religions wherever you are and not having to having to answer to some top down system in some

01:16:04.239 --> 01:16:10.000
other city so I would say moving forward in that sense is that what you

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:16.320
meant yeah so do you think you just you just sparked something in my brain if

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:23.440
what you're saying is Right are we could be in a position where there could be a

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.600
Reformation of the church itself the church could assimilate the new

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:34.560
information that's coming about itself and it change it could form something

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:39.760
new I was thinking we're just in a place of Darkness where we're gonna go back

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:46.000
down that path of the Dark Ages it could be it if you know think about not to get

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.800
political I'm not g to be political but but I mean I have to say this the the dude who just got picked to be the house

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:58.239
speaker speaker this guy is not just a Christian like every other person in Senate is everyone in Senate is a

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:04.000
Christian everyone they're all Christians or there's a couple of Jewish people in there and then there's one

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:11.040
person who considers himself an atheist Andrew Yang in the whole Congress all Christians and Catholics but these

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:19.520
people aren't really cath they just say they are they're not really like they just say it this guy is legitimately

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:25.440
thinks the world's 6,000 years old he think God created the world in seven he thinks Adam and Eve are literally real

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:32.159
like this guy is legitimately a fundamentalist Christian he and if you think about it if the

01:17:32.159 --> 01:17:38.320
president dies the vice president becomes president the vice president dies he becomes president he's third in

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:43.800
he's the third most powerful person in the nation so looking at something like

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:49.280
that then I agree with you because it could go either way either we either we

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:56.400
as a society go that way in that direction cuz that's it's right there for the taking on that side I'm not what I'm

01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:02.120
saying well going towards the principles that Greece and uh you know you know

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:07.840
Greece and Rome laid out in the Republic days and helenistic era democratus and

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:15.080
or um demostenes and Solon giv giving those laws and stuff like that um that

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:21.199
that made civilization right we are and and so so there's like half of us in the world that are trying to go in that

01:18:21.199 --> 01:18:29.400
direction and then modern not just not just to do exactly what they did but to to to have that same layout system but

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:35.760
you're right though and there's another half of the society that wants to go in that other direction and they're and

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.040
they you can see this these people are all over Twitter and they're they're always talking about look look at this

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:48.199
beautiful church that was built in 1532 why can't we build stuff like that anymore we're so weak today in society

01:18:48.199 --> 01:18:53.320
this is what they try to St and like so they they are a strong force in the

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:58.880
culture of think of that type of thinking so you're not wrong I don't think you're wrong any more anymore than

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:04.080
I think what we I think it could go either way we're in the middle right we're at a fork in the road right now

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:10.000
yeah yeah notice that the guy is also that same guy is part of this group that

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.880
is you know they're going to change education they're going to change the way that we look at the world notice

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:22.000
that they're all saying the same thing that that Christianity produced

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.880
democracy that our beloved nation is producct of uh excuse me you could not

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:35.360
be you could not be more Incorrect and I know Neil that you've put up quotes to try to yell at people and say look it

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:41.679
wasn't they did not think that way yeah people you'll he people like bench up here will say like you know the

01:19:41.679 --> 01:19:50.280
Constitution is a judeo-christian document yeah really oh my God it's so bizarre

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:55.480
because everything you find in the Constitution you can find in Pre

01:19:55.480 --> 01:20:01.320
Christian Greece like in in the laws of Solon for example in the laws of De in

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:10.520
the orations of of deases I just mentioned both of them but even Roman Republic era constit constitutions were

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:16.880
were given by the goddess this was this was understood by everybody the goddess whether it's

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:24.120
Athena or manura the goddess with the with the helmet and the shield and the spear and that she's the symbol of the

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:29.239
Constitution because the what the Constitution does is it's a Divine thing

01:20:29.239 --> 01:20:35.480
in this in in this sense why is it a Divine thing what do you mean is it magic well here's what it does everybody

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:41.560
whether you have a better abilities and capabilities of someone else or not under this constitution you this person

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:48.080
that you can have that you can easily out um you can easily outdo somebody

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:54.000
because of your wealth because of you have you have access to an army you have you control the grain whatever you are

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:00.800
you're a senator high up somewhere that person's just a plebian right but the Constitution puts up stuff that protects

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:06.719
this person with their rights so that you are bound by these

01:21:06.719 --> 01:21:12.040
same these same Powers basically like that's what a constitution does it's

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:18.360
power it sets up a system where people have protections right so that that's a

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:23.520
thing that is like so important um and I just want to say one more thing about

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:28.800
judeo-christianity having some sort of claim to this because I there's I can

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:36.679
see why they would say this but it's wrong but here's the thing so we were talking about how septu agent and the

01:21:36.679 --> 01:21:43.800
pentat was created in Alexandria uh around 300 270 BCE right

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:51.400
well one of the questions I get from people who are skeptic of this Theory will say why why do they care about

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:56.719
creating a Bible for people in Israel why wouldn't they just write their it's

01:21:56.719 --> 01:22:01.840
a decent question on the face but it's really simple once you look at the situation this is why I talk about the

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:07.639
diak key knowing the history knowing what was going on in the world at this time is so important because if you look

01:22:07.639 --> 01:22:16.840
at the sources right around 300 312 320 BCE there's a giant War over Israel

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:24.840
between taly and the son of antigonous Demetrius and fought literally in Gaza

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:30.040
this is CRA like another war in Gaza there's a thousand Wars that happened in Gaza throughout history this was one of

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:36.080
them and tmy I was I just told this story the other day on someone else's stream I'll tell it to you it's such a

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:42.360
great story Plutarch tells it the best he says that um young

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:47.719
Demetrius so demetrius's father is antigonous the oneeyed famous General

01:22:47.719 --> 01:22:53.360
who served under Alexander the Great and Alexander the Great's father

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:59.880
um uh what's his name um uh Phillip so this guy is an OG he has one eye from

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:05.400
war like he's a he's an OG his son is Demetrius now antigonus is still alive

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:12.920
during this time but he's controlling Greece he's controlling Macedonia he sends his son Demetrius to go fight tmy

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:18.239
tmy also fought under Alexander the Great side by side with this guy's

01:23:18.239 --> 01:23:24.199
father so they have a bond they're like brothers he's going to fight he's sending a son to go fight one of his

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:30.520
brothers so he goes down and they find each other in Gaza and T tmy sets up his

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:36.440
army and Demetrius sets up his army and they they fight tmy destroys him

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:42.960
absolutely annihilates his whole army takes all of his fleets in this in the Mediterranean Sea takes all of his

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:48.719
golden chests that he had because you have to when you're traveling you need funds right takes everything all of his

01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:55.199
tents all of his all of his horses all of everything gone and he now Demetrius

01:23:55.199 --> 01:24:02.760
is on his knees expecting to be executed right then and there Tomy walks up to him yeah good you did good kid it was

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:08.159
good for a first fight uh here here's all your chest back here's all of your

01:24:08.159 --> 01:24:15.480
fleets back here's all of your horses back you get out of my land I own this land now I'm taking all these Jews here

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:21.639
this is the reason why I tell them story I'm taking all these Jews here they're my slaves not yours go back and tell

01:24:21.639 --> 01:24:27.159
your father you lost come back in about a year when you get better and we'll fight again which does

01:24:27.159 --> 01:24:34.880
happen by the way um but anyways the reason why I told that story is because now talmy controls Israel he takes

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:41.920
hundreds of thousands of slaves from Israel to Alexandria Egypt about two

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:48.520
decades later is when this septu agent pentat gets created now the question of

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:55.840
why would they do this well I if you can't see it now I don't know what the to tell you because when you control a

01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:03.560
land you have to set up laws that are in line with what your ideology is talmy

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:11.320
had all the incentives in the world to set a set up a a uh mythology a history

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:18.000
and a set of laws to govern Israel he does this by the way Russell gurkin from

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.360
Copenhagen sem seminar uh International writes a whole book about this showing

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:29.600
that 95% of the laws in Deuteronomy numbers and exodus are from

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:35.639
Solon Solon and ligis and only 5% of them are found in

01:25:35.639 --> 01:25:41.600
Babylon Babylonian laws so what they did was they took all the cultural norms and

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:49.679
legends about Abraham and Moses and all these people they wrote rewrote these stories but they inserted new laws that

01:25:49.679 --> 01:25:54.840
would be that would be a beneficial to the state of the talic Empire and then

01:25:54.840 --> 01:26:00.960
guess what happened they did this and then they let all those slaves go back to Israel with their new set of laws

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:08.000
that is what that's geopolitics that's what happens in the world right now when you set up when you conquer a new land

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:14.639
you set up a new government you put a new constitution there you get a new it's this is what H this is normal stuff

01:26:14.639 --> 01:26:20.159
that happens all the time so that's your answer to why would they do this of course they would do this why wouldn't

01:26:20.159 --> 01:26:26.920
they do this they controlled that land so brilliant brilliant brilliant did you

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:35.239
notice I want everybody in the audience to notice the precise use of um the

01:26:35.239 --> 01:26:40.840
sources Neil is just reading sources right and he's just taking material from

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:48.159
sources that's all he didn't think this up he didn't sit around and right he realized it when he's putting evidence

01:26:48.159 --> 01:26:55.639
together so that he can make a case like the academic should be doing doing but don't because he's operating outside

01:26:55.639 --> 01:27:01.840
think about what Neil just said right if that's true Judaism is an invention of

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:09.239
the thir century and further down an invention it is yeah yeah think about

01:27:09.239 --> 01:27:14.800
what that does think about what that does to this very time in space just to

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:20.480
say that will cause commotion right you're not going to be popular for

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:27.280
saying that kind of thing Neil you're standing with the sources and because of that I will stand right next to you yeah

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:32.560
I'm not the only one saying it there's peerreview material on it not I'm not like I'm making this up out of thin air there other people that came to the same

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:37.600
conclusion and I didn't even know this I came to this conclusion on my own work

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:43.639
and then I found out that other people through peer review through through actual academic regular study have come

01:27:43.639 --> 01:27:51.679
to this exact same cusion as me and um what was I going to say um yeah it's um

01:27:51.679 --> 01:27:58.800
and that's that's what I that's the reason why I was saying that is because when people say judeo-christianity are the laws that are from the Constitution

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:04.440
it's like no this is standard constitutional republic that are set up

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:11.239
by ancient Classical Greece uh thinkers like so long very the very idea that the

01:28:11.239 --> 01:28:17.040
slave religion of Christianity could have produced

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:24.239
democracy is a joke it's myis is standing there your slave religion

01:28:24.239 --> 01:28:30.719
sucks right it's gonna it's going to destroy our society Christians if I can

01:28:30.719 --> 01:28:37.040
make an appeal to the evangelicals this is we'll end up with two appeals I'll do mine you do yours Neil and we'll call it

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:45.560
a night um my appeal is to the evangelicals out there you think what you're doing is bringing America you

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:53.000
think you're bringing the freedom you're not you're bringing your own chains you're taking the democracy that was

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.360
built by people who went to those classical sources and for their

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:06.199
inspiration and said oh democracy Athenian invention sounds good let's try it here in America you're taking those

01:29:06.199 --> 01:29:13.239
people's work and you're destroying it so that you can be enslaved enslaved to a

01:29:13.239 --> 01:29:20.080
Theocratic Orange monster that's what you're doing morons

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:25.520
it's you people who will drag down this country and I'm not the one who said it

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:31.360
Thomas Jefferson said greatest the greatest threat to the fledgling

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:37.679
American democracy is the Christian church right him and a lot him and a lot

01:29:37.679 --> 01:29:43.760
of other uh F uh you know constitutional fathers whatever you call them they a

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:50.320
lot of them were saying this stuff Thomas Payne was all over this stuff um Franklin every they're all were they all

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:57.239
they all were even the and and they it's and yeah they were friendly to the churches because they

01:29:57.239 --> 01:30:02.280
these are people living in the nation they're not going to they're not going to genocide Christians they weren't that's not what they're trying to do

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:08.520
it's not what me and you are trying to do it's just that you don't let that be the power that at you don't let them

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:14.600
have the power it's that simple like go ahead be a Christian over there you're fine no one's gonna mess with you but

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:19.840
you're not taking control because your system is just the last 3 400 years we

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:27.400
can see over in Europe they're not doing okay over there so and I just want to say something else about the um about

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:33.520
the idea that it's an invention well here's here's one something I want to people to think

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:40.280
about because the question would be how do you know it's an invention how do you know they weren't already you know doing

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:46.440
something similar before the Greeks conquered them well we could we have time capsules to to show this well the

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:53.560
first time capsule is the Phoenicians going down to car going over to Carthage and what do they believe in is there is

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:59.159
there Abraham stories over there no is there what gods they worship oh they're worshiping all the same Gods everyone

01:30:59.159 --> 01:31:04.600
else is worshiping oh interesting and this this and they start colonizing

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:10.159
after 700 BCE they're still colonizing in the five six 400s they're still so

01:31:10.159 --> 01:31:15.320
it's like they're right next to them why why aren't they where how come they don't know all this King David stuff

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:22.159
they just don't I'll even go closer to 300 BCE and 400 b 400 to 500 between

01:31:22.159 --> 01:31:29.560
that 400 to 500 BC you have a large amount of Jews moving down to Egypt to

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:36.280
elephantine and they left they left traces we have physical text in Aramaic

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:43.080
from this time period and you're this is 400 500 BCE this is after well this is

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:48.960
like contemporary with the Persian period right Persian period it's second temple they should be they should have a

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:54.960
whole whole Torah by then right they should have the whole Bible it should have everything nothing they don't have

01:31:54.960 --> 01:32:02.080
anything like that they don't even say the word Judaism doesn't exist in this text there is no Torah in this text

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:07.600
there is no legends about Abraham it's worshiping Yahweh yeah that's there we

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:14.159
know Yahweh is pretty you know he's Iron Age God you know we we know that but guess what we don't have guess what he

01:32:14.159 --> 01:32:20.960
also is doing they're also worshiping o Cirus and Isis and mat and Kum and uh

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:28.679
and Horus so it's like and P standard polytheistic Egyptian stuff

01:32:28.679 --> 01:32:34.400
written in Aramaic by people that call themselves Jews is it is it any wonder

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:43.199
that tacitus comes along and says oh they were just they were worshiping set on crate and ended up you

01:32:43.199 --> 01:32:49.520
know ended up going elsewhere and and and you know what bothers me about that is there's so there's if you read the I

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:55.560
think the Oxford translation has like a little commentary on the bottom saying most Scholars think he's wrong or

01:32:55.560 --> 01:33:02.719
something like that but like we know for a fact that the Philistines are from CRE

01:33:02.719 --> 01:33:08.440
the Philistines that are living in Gaza and and those cities in on the coast who

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:14.000
are Canaanites they are part of the same they speak they have a Phoenician

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:20.119
alphabet and everything they are from CRE so is he really wrong for saying

01:33:20.119 --> 01:33:26.320
that they came from CRE not he's he's looking at the geography and he's looking at his probably he probably has

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:32.400
sources of History mentioning the when the pans fled from CRE and and went

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:38.480
different directions and that was one of the directions they went was the they became the Philistines pelep pelet is in

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:44.520
the Egyptian sources and it comes from pesan and I'm I'm not the only one that said that there's like 10 different

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:49.639
Scholars who have pointed this out P pelet probably means probably is a

01:33:49.639 --> 01:33:55.880
derivative of pesan I love that I love that I um I hope it

01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:03.840
can be I hope we can open that up even more it's a froner um it's a that also mean that pal

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:10.000
that also mean that Palestine comes from pan too those Philistines are poo man

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.040
they're old old oh yeah they've been there they were there before even according to their own Bible the

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:21.960
biblical text even says the Philistines were there before they even got there yeah so even they even they had no way

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:29.000
around that one what happened what happened Neil to the Canaanites that were there because

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.400
you know every everywhere you go in Israel you dig down deep enough you get to Canaanite some kind of Canaanite

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:40.880
development and they're all gone they're all gone what happened do you think

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:48.239
let's just predict the future and this is terribly serious but satanic initiation is terribly serious um if we

01:34:48.239 --> 01:34:54.360
have all of these people that have been in a effect wiped off of the map of

01:34:54.360 --> 01:35:00.440
History um in Antiquity because you don't have any Canaanites walking around you see any Canaanites I don't see any

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:06.679
Canaanites right you see any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no you see any ammonites you mean there's a group of

01:35:06.679 --> 01:35:12.159
people yeah there were they were just like languages just like

01:35:12.159 --> 01:35:18.320
languages Neil people get wiped out I'm wondering is that what we're watching

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:24.480
now are we watching that history develop and and you know people sayoh you're

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:31.800
going to be political right the whole world right now is looking at this the entire world is looking at Israel and

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:39.360
Palestine they're watching this so all all I'm asking is as a historian as

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:44.520
location where it's going are we just doing it again tmy and

01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:50.000
and and Demetrius fought there um like the the Egyptian pharaohs fought the

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:56.679
Hittites in this region this is this is like this the the stadium for Wars or something this this little Gaza Strip

01:35:56.679 --> 01:36:02.480
for some reason you know always right there you know that's weird you know

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:09.360
that's why the evangelicals love it too they love it because this is exactly what they prophesied this is what we've

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:16.119
all been saying for so many years and writing down in these novels and left behind this is what we're all sitting

01:36:16.119 --> 01:36:21.960
there in our pews Neil we Christians we're all waiting now don't tell anybody

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:28.719
but the Christians know that the Jews will be wiped out in the end they

01:36:28.719 --> 01:36:34.760
already know that and they're rooting for the ready they're waiting to backstab once the once Enemy Number One

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:41.199
is gone which is the Muslims and then all of a sudden it's gonna be Enemy Number Two the Jew like they it's messed

01:36:41.199 --> 01:36:46.320
up dude and they're sting blood people and there's there's people

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:52.800
children dying I'm not sitting there choosing one side or the other it's this difficult situation it's but it's not

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:57.880
good I'm not sitting there rooting for one side to kill the other side that's not what I'm doing I think that's I'm

01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:04.760
just getting I'm just getting sick of watching them of kids dead I'm getting sick of looking at dead kids you know

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:11.560
what I mean messed up so messed up welcome to the messed up world somebody turned up the thermostat the mental

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:17.560
thermostat I think that's fantastic Neil I'm gonna give you the second to last word then I'm gonna hail Satan and call

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:24.520
it out so just give me a shout out or whatever you want to say man just check out the sources get get

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:30.920
get acquainted with the ancient sources and get an understanding and it's a it's a it's a big world it's a big world it's

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:36.600
a big history and uh there's never it's never there's there's enough for

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:43.199
everybody to come up with something and have come up with a um some understanding of what what what happened

01:37:43.199 --> 01:37:49.119
because history is kind of a mystery in a way we don't we don't have it all fleshed out there's there's there's some

01:37:49.119 --> 01:37:54.400
uh there's some things to look into to and stuff you know it it's uh it's it's

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:59.960
open for anyone to go and and explore and bring something back and show people

because it's vast everywhere you go every part of the world yeah amen that
