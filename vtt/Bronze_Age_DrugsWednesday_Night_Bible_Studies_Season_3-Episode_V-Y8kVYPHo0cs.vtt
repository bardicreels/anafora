00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.379
welcome back to Lady Babylon Wednesday night bible study tonight we're going to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.620
be looking at Mycenaean drug users this is fantastic

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.660
we've just been bombarded we're being bombarded by all this good evidence all

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.920
this hardcore archeology oh God throw some science in there

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.159
next thing you know hplc oh God we're getting the samples

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.220
tonight we're gonna look at a couple of things about Bronze Age drug users and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.320
we're going to look at a very frustrated person through time

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.000
and we're going to watch the world develop a sense from that evidence

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.439
despite his greatest highest loudest voice we're going to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.439
have a little clip tonight um gorgeous little clip a chance for us to hear some of the music of Zane

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:45.299
Campbell definitely didn't possess definitely no doubt certifiably love it and then

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.380
we're going to talk about some current some current events in archeology and a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.420
little bit of pharmacology we're going to start off with a little bit of Medea

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.920
so you can see who she is

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:19.370
[Music]

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.459
I hope you were not too disappointed that Neil has become a little bit not

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.920
feeling so well and won't be able to make it tonight we thank him for putting

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.379
out the effort uh appreciate that Neil hope you uh hope you feel better so

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.900
tonight whereas I was thinking about a conversation between me and Neil it's

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.239
going to end up having to be a conversation between me and an invisible devil

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.060
so I want to start out with a couple of quotes I'm going to take you I'm going to get in the ship we're going to go

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.239
back in time we're going to land somewhere 1200 1100 BC

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.760
talking near the end of the Bronze Age we're gonna talk about

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.580
one of these drug users one of these drug users should we hit

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.800
the first slide with uh I just want to read this to you this is from the orphic

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.879
argonautica we start at the end here at one of the gate posts there stood a statue of the far-seeing queen

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:29.280
scattering with emotion the radiance of fire whom the Culkin's propitiate as

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.959
Artemis of the gate resounding with the chase terrible for men to see and terrible to hear

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.799
unless one approaches the sacred rights and purification the rights kept hidden

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:51.659
by the Priestess who was initiated media unfortunate in marriage along with the

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:58.680
girls of Sita no mortal whether native or stranger entered that way crossing

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:06.659
over that threshold for the terrible goddess kept them away by all means breathing Madness into her fired-eyed

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.659
dogs I want you to make sure that you're getting an impression of

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:21.299
um the time remember we're talking about priestesses here and we're talking about a Medea who's who's the queen right and

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:29.280
she is the one who is exercised in the right only she can do it

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.320
right or sightean Maids are these

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:44.840
exceptionally skilled workers in drugs

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.580
um scythian archeresses yeah from across from across the way

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.360
on the Black Sea and these are very skilled talented people I

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.820
wanted you to see that I wanted you to see that she is named as that person you can't approach this Divinity Artemis

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.520
you can't approach her unless you go by the way of the rights

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.300
yeah by the way of the rights now I have been screaming at people about

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.820
drug use in the Bronze Age and we've all been

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:34.820
sitting here for the last four or five months and we have seen that

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:42.060
there was drug use yes there was drug use not just in Antiquity classical

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:51.060
Antiquity but preceding that considerably yeah drug use and people tend not to pay

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.780
attention well now they're paying attention and now we want to know it's funny to watch them you can watch the

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.940
evolution of the scholars here as they as they go through the machinations of

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.400
trying to set their mind outside of the Paradigm that they thought was reality

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.680
and now they have to go into another so good for them good for them it's a

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.960
it's a great experience thank you guys for doing those that hplc and whatnot

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.039
yeah fantastic um second quote by Medea I just want you to see or about Medea I just want you to

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:31.199
see the dream quickly struck terrible fear in the heart of the king

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:36.300
he seemed to see on the lovely bosom of the young Maiden Medea whom he was

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:43.199
Raising in his Halls a glistening star darting across its Heavenly path which

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:49.380
she having taken it up on her robe brought to water of the fair flowing

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.539
fossus he saw the star seize the maiden and

00:06:54.539 --> 00:07:01.979
carry her across the Black Sea relax this is the vision of ETS and that was

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:08.520
more of the orphic arganonica and this vision is preserved in multiple sources

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:15.720
and so we ask ourselves in the first quote from the argonautica who are the dogs you can't get in to see the secret

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:22.680
unless you get by the dogs but she gives those dogs maddening poison

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.680
all right she gives them maddening poison remember that maddening poison remember that we're

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:36.139
talking about the eoboloi the hurlers of the poison this is Artemis

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.240
this is Artemis who pours out the poison who

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.259
pours out the communion Venom this is her and you can't get there you can't even

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:56.280
get across the threshold all right unless you've been through the mystery you cannot get there

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:03.060
they call these the Hidden Eye the Hidden Eye because they are priestesses

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:10.860
who have been using the formula who have been using the toxins

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.380
to alter themselves right they're the Medusa

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:22.080
now I want you to see a little bit more of Madea and what's going on maybe you have

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.240
a little more respect for the knowledge because now the

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:34.979
bridies you know the scholars are always they're always right there I love it you guys you do it tremendously

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:42.240
a tremendously mediocre and sometimes late job you know and sometimes even

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:48.420
damaging by giving us garbage we don't want any garbage theories we just want

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:55.920
the evidence right and everybody knows the evidence now says from the hair samples that

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:02.940
we've got that the Bronze Age was uh full of drug use

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:09.899
yes yes that there are drugs in people hallucinogens and not necessarily the

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:16.080
hallucinogens that you wanna you know go out and see a concert with

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.540
right so yeah this is serious stuff let's take

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.760
a look at it I want before we do I want to watch a little clip just two number

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:32.399
one to do two things number one to remind you that we've been talking about these people using drugs for the last

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:37.440
six months and number two to set your mind in that

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:43.380
place where you can say Okay um how are these Scholars looking at

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:49.920
this evidence what are they doing with it yeah love it let's hit the clip

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:59.459
please [Music] [Applause] what a mess I'm made of it all and I

00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:05.519
guess I gotta blame myself oh I could blame it on

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:13.639
are on him or on them but in the end I made my own little help

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:19.100
and they wonder why foreign

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:24.780
[Applause] [Music]

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:30.860
[Applause] [Music]

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:41.490
[Applause] [Music] [Applause]

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:48.079
[Music] [Applause] [Music]

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:55.660
turns on me [Applause]

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:03.779
[Music] [Applause] [Music]

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:11.579
I hope that set the mood a little bit there because we're going to be talking about how we got there

00:11:11.579 --> 00:11:18.779
so this as you know this story is blowing up right the story's blowing up it's all everywhere from The New York

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:25.980
Times it's all over journals let's splash some of these up here you guys have seen this you guys have seen this

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:31.140
here we go here's Salon Bronze Age Europeans we're getting high on all

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:37.560
kinds of drugs hair analysis study fines wow that's fantastic how about another

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:44.700
one here's one from CNN my goodness look at that that's Central 3 000 year old hairs

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:51.720
hold the ancient oldest clues about psychoactive drug use in Europe fantastic

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:58.220
here's one from the Greek reporter scientists discover evidence of drug use

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:04.860
during Bronze Age rituals okay it's getting deeper right we're

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:10.019
getting in there tripping in the Bronze Age says the says the New York Times

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:16.500
right right love it we're going to look at a couple of these in depth this one I think is gross I don't know why but that

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:22.200
whatever that is I know it's no offense is the Bronze Age dude or do that who

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:28.680
was wearing that but I don't know it makes my stomach turn a little bit direct evidence of ancient Bronze Age

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:34.860
drug use found in Menorca right so this is all off that that Spanish Island fine

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:40.200
that they've got with hair and what they're looking at it and I just wanted you to see a couple of quotes right

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.720
direct evidence the use of multiple drugs and Bronze Age Menorca from human

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:52.019
hair analysis beautiful beautiful archeology evidence of drug use during

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:57.180
Bronze Age ceremonies Bronze Age ceremonies they say right

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:04.620
Bronze Age ceremonies okay let's keep going here's direct quote the

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:11.040
findings published Thursday and scientific reports of the journal Nature great Journal provide the first direct

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.320
evidence that ancient Europeans consume psychoactive drugs much like their

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.839
pre-columbian brethren in mesoamerica the researchers said

00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:26.880
wait a minute did he say brethren

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:33.240
what what was that I need that quote back we here there we go

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:39.380
um yeah Brethren okay they weren't really brothers right I don't know where you know they're not even

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:45.480
closely related right but okay um who knows that's a nice Ambiance he's

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:53.220
trying to create there right um yeah this is he says the first direct evidence that ancient Europeans now when

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:58.860
he's saying ancient Europeans he's talking Bronze Age right and this is my frustration if the

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:05.880
classicists were on the ball and I'll just throw it out there this is not the first evidence that we

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:11.459
have of ancient drug use several of these articles say that this we finally

00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:18.540
have evidence for ancient drug use take a step back Poindexter

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:23.579
put down that slide rule put it down put it down

00:14:23.579 --> 00:14:30.480
the words that you're using to describe all of these drugs

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.940
um they're already talking about in detail and we'll see this is the right

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:42.839
apparently this is amazed what here's a problem classes don't like to go there because classes and you can ask anybody

00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:48.480
ask them all ask barter and right um uh because people watch him here not

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:54.899
because he's classes he's not classes but um you know ask Carl Rock right

00:14:54.899 --> 00:15:02.459
um this is uh this stuff has been sitting in this literature for a ton of time and nobody reads it

00:15:02.459 --> 00:15:07.920
thousands of pages on drugs I can even tell you what was on that hair

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:15.420
yeah I'm going to show you you're going to the benefit of coming tonight was that you get to be

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:20.699
one step ahead of the rest of the world one step just one

00:15:20.699 --> 00:15:26.500
let's do it let's do it um

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:33.720
[Music] yeah here's the main doc who's ahead of it right Guerra dos I'm not quite sure

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.940
I'm sorry but listen if I've mispronounced your name the lead author of the study said

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:45.420
researchers were stunned by the results now wait a minute nobody's done guys just wait especially because the cave

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:52.139
Interiors yielded knowledgeable signs of drugs presence myself okay well they

00:15:52.139 --> 00:15:57.899
didn't they had it in their hair but not in their pockets okay fine a chemical

00:15:57.899 --> 00:16:03.860
analysis of the hair revealed evidence of three alkaloid substances what are those alkaloids those are those

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:11.519
nitrogenous substances that have some kind of physiological activity yeah human body I

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:16.860
think the anti-fungal they can be pain killers you know you know

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:25.440
um uh you're not gonna get to chase the dragon without um alkaloids right alkaloids nice family

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:34.860
chemicals yeah known to produce Altered States Of Consciousness what they find ephedrine atropine and scopolamine and

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.899
for those of you who are you know just somewhere on the periphery Neuroscience

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:45.300
mate you might be in neuroscientist or you might be a some molecular biologist

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:51.660
you know maybe chemist um maybe an engineer right and you might

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:59.160
be familiar with some of this terminology uh you know that these substances are not these are not

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:04.438
um lightweights right atropy and Scopolamine that will put you into a

00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:09.959
vision state that the magic I use to torture people to get information out of

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:15.660
them right yeah that's what these people had in their hair

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:22.020
for that diamond surprised at this I don't know why

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:27.240
they're surprised um yeah especially when the especially when

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:32.640
the Greeks are documenting all of this and you say to yourself oh

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:38.520
give us the evidence we're hungry I want that evidence I want your evidence

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:45.660
give me that evidence I'll give you my evidence just all you got to do is go back to Homer I was

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:53.700
talking with I was talking with Neil today and Neil said he'd interviewed a PhD and PhD got his PhD in New Testament

00:17:53.700 --> 00:18:00.179
studies right and then he went back and got a master's degree in Classics and he said

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:06.740
he didn't realize how full of nothing was the was the Bible studies degree

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:13.380
isn't that funny because he went back and got a classic degree they brought him up to the evidence and I know you're

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:21.780
hungry for that my audience is hungry for that evidence give me that I want that Eminence I got Homer let's

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:29.700
call up Homer right and you're saying wait a minute wait a minute okay where are we don't worry it's 9th 8th century

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:37.440
right BC 9th or 8th century yeah we're only a couple of centuries

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.080
away from that ending of that Bronze Age right we're

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:51.539
talking about the same Generations Homer is hearkening back to this Bronze Age oh

00:18:51.539 --> 00:18:57.539
and he is saying in it they're on drugs what do you mean this

00:18:57.539 --> 00:19:03.480
is the first evidence we've ever had what are you talking about go to the

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:11.520
text oh my God you can't have a party in the in the Bronze Age without getting

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.460
there on drugs and that's what the scholars are so worried about they're trying to make sure I'm going to show

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:26.700
you these quotes they want you to know they want you to know this is not for fun this is not for fun no

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:31.740
I want to take you out back I got a place for you I'm back come on

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:37.080
let's go it's okay services are over all right come on

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:43.860
come on we gotta take off the uniforms anyway you know what I mean they want to take you out back right

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:49.740
Homer is talking about the drugs right you have a giant party where you

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:55.919
have people over you you've doused them in drugs wine drug

00:19:55.919 --> 00:20:03.179
laced wine that gets them so bent that he says you could kill their mother or

00:20:03.179 --> 00:20:11.520
father in front of them and they wouldn't care now Vice news thanks for the bid on the

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.980
Scorpion smoking get out there and look at that if you guys haven't seen that

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:24.480
um the place that takes you right is a place they're going backwards back

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:30.000
and forth to all right to enter these these places

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:40.020
where you can interact with the powers that be real sorcery real sorcery yeah I love it

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:46.380
let's keep going I gotta wait which one of my chewy this one okay the author suggests that in the presence of these

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:53.220
alkaloids may have been due to consumption of some Nightshade plants such as mandrake

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:58.380
okay now look I want you to notice as we're reading these these are all these

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:05.700
are all of the suspects The Usual Suspects you could look in any

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:12.360
um Inquisition documentation at all you can look up any Inquisition documentation you watch the

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:18.900
trials um you can see what kind of testimony you get out of this is the thing they're always these are the drugs the standard

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:24.000
list of drugs they are always catching the witches with always catching them

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.840
with what do we get here Mandrake right they also use Mandrake by the way in surgery

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:37.380
in Antiquity yeah cool huhn Bane right higher Sky Ms that's what they call

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:44.280
angry that's a Greek name hey for all you people who are surprised all of you Scholars I know I give you credit you

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:50.520
guys are out there digging in the dirt and you're getting the evidence who are right I love that but look here the

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:57.059
Greek name for the drug you found right is sitting right in front of our faces high of skyamus right that's all

00:21:57.059 --> 00:22:03.659
you gotta know did they know about these drugs yeah did they use them of course they did and they wrote a ton about

00:22:03.659 --> 00:22:09.179
using them that nobody shame on the classics out there one more time as a

00:22:09.179 --> 00:22:16.260
ronin I want to say this if today is my last I want the world to know

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:23.100
that the people and Classics have let you down that they are dogs that they

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:30.299
are not the Guardians of those sacred words that they have lost their right

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:36.780
to call themselves Defenders of the Muse shame on you people

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:44.039
there's literally thousands of stuff that remains untranslated because like my dissertation is like my the head of

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:50.360
my department told me when I was given my dissertation said

00:22:50.659 --> 00:22:56.539
the Romans they just wouldn't do such a thing

00:22:57.179 --> 00:23:04.919
I was like are we talking about the same people are we talking about the same people have you seen what the Romans do

00:23:04.919 --> 00:23:11.460
yeah okay let's keep going because I want to get to Jesus I want to get to stabbing Jesus we're gonna get there

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:19.799
this one yeah here we go uh hang on no I'm gonna read this henbane and Thorn Apple right what else joint Pine the

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:26.159
author suggests that these drug plants may have been used as part of ritual ceremonies performed by a shaman right

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:31.200
that was they all run to that right now now we're getting outside the evidence

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:37.620
right and what do they use for evidence the concentric circles and the wooden containers may have depicted ice okay

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:43.980
personally people that's it in my scientific opinion having worked in the

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:50.400
lab myself uh vest doesn't hold up come on guys you can do better that's the

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:57.539
best you Scholars can do I'm sure there are people right now who are writing a book probably for Rutledge and I'll bet

00:23:57.539 --> 00:24:05.520
you can look at all these pots and they'll say this is the Psychedelic experience no you can't make conclusions

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:11.159
like that then it's not how you use evidence I wouldn't hold up in a court you think they would convict someone on

00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:17.159
a murder charge based on the the big googly eyes and the pots yeah

00:24:17.159 --> 00:24:23.460
people grow up why don't you just read your text why don't you just read what the people that came after them said to

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:30.600
do with the drugs I don't know maybe that's an idea Helen is putting drugs in

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:37.500
the wine Cersei is drugging men she's got the dildo Rod she is trogging man

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:45.360
man this is an operation this is Big Stuff these are crazy poisons right love

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:51.059
it this stuff will get you going and people are shocked oh we found hair we

00:24:51.059 --> 00:24:57.659
found Bronze Age herring in this hair we found drugs do you know how frustrating it is step back for a minute

00:24:57.659 --> 00:25:05.580
step back for a minute you know I have been shouting to the world right

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:13.080
I've been shouting the word Carl Rock has been shouting to the world his whole career right and people look at you

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:20.039
funny now you've got hair you morons now you've got hair and now you see it's

00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:24.179
there yeah finally

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:30.779
oh you don't deserve it you don't deserve to know what the Caesars were doing

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:37.140
you don't deserved in the cult you despicable Athenian women weren't

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:43.860
staying indoors all the time shame on you shame on you

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:49.440
you pretend to write a book disgusting

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:56.520
open up the pharmaceutical stuff let's see where it goes you'll have to forgive me I have a clear

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:03.240
distaste for Academia but um I was known for that as a graduate

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:10.020
student too and I would always bring the they were like oh Hillman's here he's going to bring up

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:17.700
something that nobody knows read the tax people it's all there let's keep going this is exciting the researchers noted

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:23.400
that do the dangerous nature of the alkaloids found in the hair using and handling these substances requiring

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:29.100
specialized knowledge and expertise what a bunch of geniuses you guys are

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:34.320
yeah congratulations congratulations if you'd read the

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.960
documents they talk about what Specialists you have to have just to

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:45.360
procure these drugs much less to make the compounds and what to do with them

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:51.720
you know some of this stuff is great this is a you know and remember Bronze

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:57.179
Age is the glory time that's when these big

00:26:57.179 --> 00:27:02.640
cities are getting built that's when what you and I call civilization that's

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:08.220
when it's thriving it's only afterwards with the Dark Age

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:16.380
but they don't know what happened it's an island blew up and people invaded and uh you know famine you know all that

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:21.799
kind of stuff they don't know what caused that but we went backwards

00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:27.120
we know that the people that were associated just think on this for a minute the people that were associated

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:34.080
with the advancements were the ones who were actively um performing the mystery whereby they

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:40.980
were exposed to the drugs yeah love it let's go on next quote or are we do we

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:47.700
get us here good drug use among humans is a practice not only thousands of years old based on clues that were

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:54.120
previously uncovered Eurasia and the Americas but in Europe the presence of mind-offering plants at prehistoric

00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:00.419
sites offered archaeologists an incomplete picture until now they lacked evidence that people in ancient

00:28:00.419 --> 00:28:06.659
communities ingested the plants oh by the way it didn't ingest them all right

00:28:06.659 --> 00:28:16.559
there's a lot of where they eat this stuff Medea invented the vapor bath they call it the

00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:23.820
vapor bath and you ask yourself what's the what's the favorite bath remember she's surrounded by scythian

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:30.120
um women and these women um bathe themselves as our text tell us

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:35.940
eroticus um with the fumigation and they have like oils they put on their skin made

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:43.320
out of woods um very nice great descriptions of this stuff um beautiful beautiful so

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:50.820
um there's some real real chemistry right there from the beginning with all this bring that up again yeah

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:58.440
um but with these new findings representing the earliest evidence of drug consumption right so Medea invents

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:05.520
the um Vapor bath which you would think is like

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:12.120
a steam bath but it's just the exposure to the Smoke of something yeah isn't

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:20.220
that neat you can it's like a fumigation that later is called a fumigation right yeah nice and so apparently she's the

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:25.380
one who invented this we have that attributed to her isn't that nice so you

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:33.360
can enter when you enter into the Tabernacle I had one person tell me this week stop my my worldview Chatters and I

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:40.020
can't I don't want to keep going down this path right when you got that person who steps into the

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:46.620
tent curtains that hold in all the vapor and

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:52.080
they're talking to God right this is pre-moses right we're

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:58.679
talking Moses is coming from these Traditions they're talking about Mycenaean stuff they're talking about

00:29:58.679 --> 00:30:05.279
1600 Moses was later right that's why he's throwing around his serpent right

00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:12.360
people think of Charlton Heston and that people watched Easter and they saw the guy with the big beard and hold them up

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:18.299
yeah they don't realize that um that dude was throwing snakes around

00:30:18.299 --> 00:30:25.620
right he's performing magic bro yeah doing he built a tent

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:32.220
and you can go inside that tent and you can talk to God you will hear the voice

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:37.740
of God don't worry we're gonna tie a rope to your leg because if you pass out we'll drag you out

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:44.220
right that's Vapor dude this is Bronze Age Technology that there let's go to

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:49.740
the next quote that they're harnessing here um these findings are so singular said

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:56.760
the doc in charge right um sometimes when people think about drugs they think it's a modern practice

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:02.700
these results tell us a different story there's also those of us who when they

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:09.720
hear about drugs no it's a modern breath no it's an ancient practice as well as a modern one so it doesn't bother us uh we

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:16.580
wouldn't be surprised according to the study the floor native to Menorca includes the psychoactive species datera

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:23.279
hyoscience and mandragora right which contain the propane derivatives atropy

00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:30.720
and Scopolamine also on the island is ephedra which contains the phenylethylamine derivative ephedrine

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:37.260
and papaver some nephron yay for the Opium that's the Opium this is quite a

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:42.840
cocktail we're ending off with here isn't it this is wonderful um which has its own alkaloids right

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:48.779
more morphine which we all know right everybody big hand for morphine uh long

00:31:48.779 --> 00:31:54.360
long long long history yeah it turns out your ancestors were shipping opium all

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.820
over the world long time ago way before they invented democracy way before where

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:06.960
they did you know killing pain is killing pain bro the Bronze Age populations of Menorca may have employed

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:12.960
drug plants for their medicinal properties thanks genius however the high levels of toxicity found in the

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:20.940
hair samples suggests the plant drugs were also used for the hallucinogenic properties in shamanic ceremonies right

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:26.220
so in shamanic ceremonies guest gasket was that written in the cave I was

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:33.000
written in the cave all you found is some people with drugs considering the potential toxicity of

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.640
the alcohol is found in the hair they're handling use in applications represent highly specialized knowledge the

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:46.620
author's report yeah I wonder where they passed that on to yeah going back to the shamans what is

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:54.059
wrong with you people don't you know that when people think of Shaman do you know what they think of yeah

00:32:54.059 --> 00:33:00.899
they don't think of the queen of caucus who created the medes

00:33:00.899 --> 00:33:07.200
right they don't know they don't shaman she was in a shaman she was a

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:13.140
witch Queen you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who knew the mystery

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:21.059
yeah who dispensed the poison of the Echidna love it from

00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:30.240
her Dark Harbor you give that one you classicist that fracture your brain Dark Harbor is

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.700
your vagina when it's covered with the burning purple yeah

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:41.179
yeah did we get censored on that or something

00:33:41.179 --> 00:33:48.659
hang on chewies we just hit an asteroid or something what was that wow okay I got it

00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:54.899
oh are we we're overheating hang on it's too much I start talking about

00:33:54.899 --> 00:34:02.480
yeah about the um pudenda we'll say it politely and scientifically

00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:12.138
the purple Harbor that's where it's all sailors go

00:34:12.899 --> 00:34:19.740
the ones who sail into the ion that's where they go

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:25.500
okay let's keep going these people are getting creepy plants like hinbane and

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:31.378
Belladonna produce atropy and Scopolamine but the plant that these Bronze Age people were most likely

00:34:31.379 --> 00:34:38.398
eating was Thorn Apple also known as Jimson weed it has distinct spiky seed

00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:46.378
pods and muted lavender flowers okay nice nice but what does it do look reportedly some potent often nightmarish

00:34:46.379 --> 00:34:53.398
trips that's where you want to get when you get here some of these reports talk about you know what's the use of these

00:34:53.399 --> 00:35:00.660
it's got to be sacred one of the authors said it's not the profane it's the sacred right and you're asking yourself

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:06.119
why are they so why are they so crazy about the fact that this can't be

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:14.760
um some people in the Bronze Age kicking back and getting recreationally super high going to a a

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:20.460
religious performance that their family goes to their grandparents had been to

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:27.960
you know that's why the people wear the dye in their hair man it's just part of the society right it's part of the our

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:33.119
medicine so what is wrong with you people what is wrong

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:40.740
the modern Iron Age poop where's the next one right here

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:46.140
here we go I got an alarm going off too you better find out what that is the recovery of human hair in the late

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:53.700
Bronze Age burial cave uh provides a unique opportunity to for the probe into the medicinal and ritual realms of

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.920
indigenous inhabitants of Western Mediterranean it's already 3 000 years ago

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:05.099
the results finish direct evidence yeah furnished direct evidence of the consumption of plant okay okay so yeah

00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:10.380
we know they took drugs now um here we're going to skip over that

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:18.359
and we're gonna go to recent analysis of hair watch this there's one really good scientific article on this one right

00:36:18.359 --> 00:36:24.359
um in nature and it's a fantastic it's a fantastic article and it goes over

00:36:24.359 --> 00:36:30.119
methods right analysis you can get all the chemistry for those of you Geeks Who

00:36:30.119 --> 00:36:36.240
are hplc um people and know what that means

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:41.940
um you know Mass Spectrum spectrometers and all that kind of stuff equipment

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:48.000
that we need if that stuff turns you on then um take a look at the one in nature but

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.220
here's a funny here's a funny reference to that recent analysis of hair of patients suffering from detera poisoning

00:36:55.220 --> 00:37:01.680
revealed atropine and scopolamine in a patient who admitted regular consumption

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:09.900
of detera and only Scopolamine in a regular cannabis abuser

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:15.380
wait a minute a regular a regular

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:21.000
is this thing scientific do you people see what happens as soon as you get into

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.640
this world of the recreation as soon as you get into this world of the high all

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:32.820
of a sudden it's not acceptable right the the Cannabis abuser

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:39.960
how many people you can't abuse cannabis that scientist needs to find out that you can't abuse cannabis

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:47.280
you can't you you learn to you you learn to Make Love Not War right

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:55.079
right they should have said the lover of cannabis in that article we found this lover of cannabis and he had the what's

00:37:55.079 --> 00:38:01.380
the point Poindexter the point is that he had the the Scopolamine and atropine

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:08.400
right or he didn't have the atropine but he did have the Scopolamine so these chemicals are being liberated and used

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:15.660
that's what the point is fantastic and they are terrible hallucinogens you can put somebody into

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:21.599
a state of complete total psychosis and now you understand why we've been

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:26.640
talking about all these caves all these caves Devils give me a little bit more

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:33.540
time tonight right um these caves and why they're going into the caves right it's where they

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:39.839
found this stuff is in a cave all right so there's got to be some that's why they try to bring in the

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:47.220
bring in the shaman this dirty he probably smells bad I bet that Shaman's underwear are dirty how much you want

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:52.800
that um this one fantastic but the dire oh

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:58.980
yeah this is I want to read you I wanted to get into a little bit of uh a little

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:05.880
bit of um we're talking now about Bronze Age drugs right one of the areas that people don't

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:12.119
talk about are the Venoms they come up all the time on the witch side they come

00:39:12.119 --> 00:39:18.900
up on the Midwifery side they come up on the oracular side you got a rock either priests we're writing about oh God this

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:26.099
is great combination of X Y and Z and you put this in bam right this stuff is

00:39:26.099 --> 00:39:33.180
great literature there's more on Theory X as a matter of fact I'm going to scare you a little bit I hope I do

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:40.619
um I was reading just this week in a place that hasn't been translated from Galen he's writing about Theory Acts and

00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:47.940
he says there is a theory act that is peculiar or particular to The House of the Caesars

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:54.420
yeah it is there family mystery communion

00:39:54.420 --> 00:40:02.160
yeah do you know who Julius Caesar put a portrait of in the temple of Venus

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:07.680
genetics and for those of you who are not in the know with Rome I'm sorry I don't mean to point that's

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:16.880
rude but for those of you who are not in the know with Rome Venus geometrics is our mother

00:40:17.099 --> 00:40:20.960
excuse me where I put my bracelet on

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:29.940
Venus good Matrix is our mother right if you're a Roman you know you're a

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:34.980
descendant of Venus genetics who it is Julius Caesar

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:41.040
get a portrait of and set it up in the temple of Venus genetrics he gets a

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:47.880
portrait of Medea he gets a portrait of Medea because the echidnae no

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:55.079
yeah I've seen things I've seen things and I keep screaming about them I don't

00:40:55.079 --> 00:41:00.839
scream about them I just I just wrote papers and went to conferences and wrote books

00:41:00.839 --> 00:41:05.940
couple of books um and now people are seeing the stuff

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:12.420
is there let's take the next step I was going to show you some text but I think we've

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:19.859
gone beyond um let us

00:41:19.859 --> 00:41:25.680
be satisfied in this in this

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:33.000
world where the drugs are used in

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.599
medicine and in health and are a big part of the development of

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:46.260
the religious attitude of the people yeah these drugs have tremendous

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:53.940
tremendous influence on society and the Mystery as started by and

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:59.700
perpetuated through the conkians eventually

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:05.579
all the way through the Etruscans right

00:42:05.579 --> 00:42:11.400
how do we know how do we know this is what they're going to be finding out in the future right I told you I would I

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:17.339
would do this okay so they talk about the hair dye you've got this red hair dye

00:42:17.339 --> 00:42:23.280
right yeah here we go here we go

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.040
this is the ferric oxide right ferric oxide and where do you find this though

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:37.980
you find the stuff in the limney and Earth you find it in what they called Lindy and Earth Galen went to limnos to

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:46.980
find this stuff because he claimed that it could heal breast tumors in

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:53.240
women now he said other things about it but that was one of the things that caught me as a grad student I was like what

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:59.339
yeah and he would it's something special I gave a paper on this and people

00:42:59.339 --> 00:43:05.339
speculated about what it could have been in the Lebanon Earth well this stuff is also

00:43:05.339 --> 00:43:12.540
um a base for a die right it's a base for a coloring agent you can make paint with it right and

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:20.099
um what they would do is they would put it for example today I was reading a priest named nikander who said look you know if

00:43:20.099 --> 00:43:27.300
you're out and you get bit and you don't have your coating on um it's your fault right your dermal

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:35.280
coating um there are paints that you can put on that will deactivate

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:41.819
poisons yeah very practical if you think about it yeah you can see you can see people

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:48.900
developing that that makes perfect sense just like that stuff the Medusa the temple Guardians put in their hair right

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:56.760
that they drag their arrows across and then their arrows are poisonous same kind of approach it's a very

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:03.300
naturalistic approach it's why the world monotheism

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:08.579
um when it encounters that world is on Shaky Ground it's not flexible enough to

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:15.180
absorb that that nature that pure exercise of nature right stop what

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:20.420
you're doing and that's where we get the Franks done well it turns out that this

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:26.180
substance right I'm going to pull up this in Greek for you it's called miltos

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:32.540
miltos red earth right red ocher I guess on the Brit sign they call it rutle

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:39.180
rutle Riot it's this red lead or this oxide right and notice that it's from

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:48.140
Lemonade look at number Roman numeral number two here in this Victorian classical philology Paradise Island

00:44:48.859 --> 00:44:54.900
what is oh wait a minute that's the rust that grows

00:44:54.900 --> 00:45:00.119
on the wheat and hence it is a title

00:45:00.119 --> 00:45:05.700
that we give to Demeter a title an apathet for her is this rust that grows

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:12.720
on wheat and so right away I know the neuroscientists out there right I'm

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:18.420
thinking of one in particular but I'll pretend like I'm speaking to a group of them

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:24.599
you all know now um that oh okay there could be a connection with the

00:45:24.599 --> 00:45:30.900
um ergot and the LSD because it's that rust that wheat rust

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:40.079
it's a fungus that produces the right stuff you can paint that stuff on your skin as well as

00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:47.160
put it into a barley meal drink right if your Barley's rusted right you

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:53.280
can put it into a drink as well or you can put it on your skin the Etruscans like to put it on their skin you ever

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.760
seen Etruscans they have like red skin they're like what's that

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:05.220
it's not because their colors were messed up right it's not because they we

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:11.760
don't understand do you see how bright red that stuff is there's no way right what is that that's artificial

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:18.240
yeah I know it turns out it is and we have descriptions of applying these things to your skin and the dyes are

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:24.960
huge the dyes are huge they called Hercules porphyrian right because of the

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:31.440
purple dye that he's marked with and where is he getting that he's getting it in the mystery and the only

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.839
one allowed and the Herculean mystery who is a female the only one that has a

00:46:36.839 --> 00:46:43.859
vagina has the black Harbor right Medea alone is allowed in the

00:46:43.859 --> 00:46:51.420
right so when the scientists dig up the hair and they find on it and everybody here

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:57.960
who's been because you all know I've been yelling about this for the last few months here on on our

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:06.060
you know Venture and our satanic initiation okay they came up with physical evidence

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:11.220
for it right good for them good job guys good job now let's keep

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:16.440
going and let's say what are these formula do how are they used why were

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:22.680
they using them why were they inducing was it a low enough level that they didn't induce you know you weren't

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:29.400
chronically walking around a state of psychosis right or the Roman doctors that's the

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:34.500
state where the Roman doctors are like you the guy coming out of the tavern he's like bleeding like a sheep and

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:39.960
irrational right that's the dude that is on X and you give them this antidote

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:46.079
right so we're not talking about the we're not talking about oh my God you

00:47:46.079 --> 00:47:51.480
know this discovery is great everybody should love this discovery because it is

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:58.500
showing the world that we have concrete drug use that people cannot say

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:03.900
um uh any longer that drug use isn't an

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:09.240
integral part of the development of human history

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:15.660
yeah it's an integral part of our history it is there and maybe

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:22.079
I'll just propose one thing I wanted to talk about the dips ass poisoning tonight and I want to talk

00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:28.200

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:39.359
wanted you to get there because I want us to be able to get a clear picture

00:48:39.359 --> 00:48:47.160
of what the texts are representing right no more no more time people the buses

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:54.839
already left for on theories and and uh you know Grand conclusions of idiot

00:48:54.839 --> 00:49:01.800
Scholars now is the time for us to say okay what's here and what can we apply and that's what that's what I'd like to

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:07.560
do is I'd like to help bring us forward then and say how can we really guard the

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:15.359
information that's in these texts well we can bring it into the museum and open it up and let people see it right and

00:49:15.359 --> 00:49:21.000
maybe there's something there maybe there's something there about our exposure over time

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:28.200
um we might it they may have been right we may be part of the generation that would decline there may be something

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:33.599
