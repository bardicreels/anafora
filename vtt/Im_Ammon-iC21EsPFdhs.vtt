to see a teenager in a Bible class open up

have their eyes open this is a marvelous thing but there's

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:13.860
one thing in my life that tastes even better

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.060
than the newborn

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.539
and that is the Nemesis of the blood to take down the arrogant and haughty

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:35.240
to bring them to their knees to show the world their emptiness

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:43.020

this place I said this is a marvelous place

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:20.040
it was the vineyard of an ancient witch

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:28.339

these clips and let's talk about what this fool is raving

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:06.480
I said break the Christian lens the first thing that you all believe that is completely wrong is that women have no

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.580
power in the ancient world that they were slaves they were chattel you've heard this you've heard this the classes

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:17.700
repeat this over and over and over again and that's completely wrong and the way that you can see this is the earliest

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:24.420
medicine we say is hypocratic right it's not the earliest medicine is actually gynecological you can look at the

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:31.200
Hippocratic Corpus and see the the hippocratics were borrowing from a female tradition and we have one text the diseases of

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.899
women that Scholars have said this is written by one of the hippocratics Hippocrates are one of his students and

00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:42.779
they smile and look at each other it's not in English right they smile and look at each other and in the text itself it

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:47.880
says don't trust those stupid men Physicians you have to go to a woman

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:55.140
because only we know the body Mars Needs women

00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:01.560
definitely and I am looking for that Amazonian at this point I am looking for

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:07.680
that Amazonian woman I have founder in the text and I've started to pull her

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.800
out and see her for what she is and her beauty her amazing Beauty and in front

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.019
of the scholars and the you know the who has and the big shots

00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:24.959
and the people with the foundations and whatnot um

00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:31.079
um maybe some of them want to know but we're not going to sell this material right we're not going to sell this

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:36.779
material we're just gonna profane the sacred I'm doing that with you and I

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:42.180
know that you know it I can't I can't hear you directly but in my mind I can

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:48.540
hear what you're thinking and I know you've come for those profanations

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.180
you've come it's inside of you you were drawn

00:11:54.140 --> 00:12:00.720
it's just what they told me yeah fantastic fantastic where does this

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.120
guy go where's this guy he goes right through education and it gets to the point that he's

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:12.000
writing his dissertation and it causes a splash it causes a little bit of a splash and how does it do that because

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.959
the dissertation committee did not want me to publish anything about recreational drug use or the classical

00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:24.959
authors who were indulging in recreational drug use and you know

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:30.660
what this did to me it caused me to vow

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:37.740
that for the rest of my life I would find those things that people

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:43.019
didn't want published I've got one for you tonight and I'm

00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:48.480
going to publish it here instead of writing it up in a mukmuk journal

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.060
I'm gonna burn it I'm gonna burn it so far through the the Publishers will

00:12:54.060 --> 00:13:00.060
never be able to carry it because what are we all interested here in what are

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:06.660
what's the whole purpose for this life of Ammon yes right

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:13.800
it's to find out who that naked kid was with Jesus right come on this is really what we all

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:21.839
want to know it's the answer and the fish would get off the ground get back

00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:27.959
and solve for us the language you and I would have the oldest language of

00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:35.040
Western Civilization don't even bring don't even bring your

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:41.540

yeah I'm talking pulaskian you know you're gonna love this stuff

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.760
and when you see Jesus in a light tonight I'm gonna give it to you okay I

00:13:53.760 --> 00:14:00.959
should stop I should stop run that first second clip let's keep going there's a drug that Mary Magdalene gives

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:07.139
to Jesus I hate using the Bible because then all the gnostics will start yelling but there's a drug that Mary Magdalene

00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:13.620
gives to Jesus right and if you look check it out in the Greek there's not one name for one plant you

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:19.740
guys are all know that right because you live that but modern classes don't

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:27.000
and in these texts you have all sorts of different names you have street names for drugs opium you don't call it opium in the

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.240
ancient world you call it the juice she gives it to him before the garden for ends up in the garden that's where he's

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:40.079
betrayed when he's in the garden he's with that kid in the garden is there an association is there was there a reason

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:45.540
that he was he had the linen cloth the kid had a linen cloth

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:51.240
what do we know about linen what kind of Ceremonies is that used in why is it that Jesus's apostles are

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:58.980
standing at a distance why is it a public park why is Jesus dealing with a prostitute in the first place and what

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:04.500
is that prostitute that's what our understanding of the term is how did the

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:10.560
Greeks and the Romans and the hellenists that lived in the that lived in the mishmash of Judea

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.079
how did they interpret that

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:22.680
yeah yeah where does that take us you see how we

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.320
jumped into the Forbidden especially when we tried on prostitutes

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:34.680
right as soon as we bring up that prostitutes I'm going to show you in a minute a prostitute

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:40.199
on a crucifix you're gonna love it you're gonna absolutely love it this is

00:15:40.199 --> 00:15:45.600
hidden stuff people nobody gives you this text because these kind of tax they

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.839
don't want you to have but it's not because it's a conspiracy

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:57.959
you know it's just because they're lazy you have to read a lot of pharmacology

00:15:57.959 --> 00:16:03.240
you got to read a lot of medicine bro these people don't read the medicine I

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:09.360
went and studied with the dude who did the medicine and the history

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:15.959
yeah Dr John Scarborough it was my privilege to have been able to work with him

00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:21.899
yeah this is the kind of stuff you know these tax guys are out there

00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:28.339
and they rub up against the ceiling and you really have to find

00:16:28.339 --> 00:16:34.079
a very intelligent way of penetrating further and further and further that

00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:42.300
academic progress is that constant steady motion that moving forward and

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:48.660
forward and forwards until that Rhythm gets to a point and you get that song

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:55.560
you get that song all from the evidence we are classical philologists who is

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:03.959
almond he's a trained classical philologist and Classics for those of you who think

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:11.640
what classicist yeah before there were phds from the

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:19.438
University system before there were medieval wise men

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:25.740
before there were Roman educated yeah

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:31.320
yeah way before all of that

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:39.419
do you have those who tended the museum those were the first classical philologists your universities

00:17:39.419 --> 00:17:45.240
spring from them from the discipline of classical philology

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:51.179
from the language of the ancient Greeks came power

00:17:51.179 --> 00:17:58.860
yeah power power to figure things out yeah gorgeous love it

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:07.200
we have to honor the muse this is why we're here still under the Muse and that's what the life of almond

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:14.160
um reflects yeah the madness let's get that Fury this was

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.980
a this was a production this is a woman on an altar who earlier

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:26.720
has taken a phallus has taken a prop

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:32.640
that caused a professor his position

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:39.539
at a university yes they'll say it was the phallus they'll say it was the phallus that did

00:18:39.539 --> 00:18:46.679
it but on that night of that performance a professor at a university named almond

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:52.860
got to sit in an audience and got to watch a stage full of

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:58.980
Catholic girls point a phallus

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:05.280
what is called in Rome afoskinum they got to point this thing they wanted

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:12.600
authenticity you know contractually I was bound to do it I I didn't care did they give you a big

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:18.900
Advance nope right wasn't anything about cashola

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:25.880
it was about integrity and they pointed these phalluses these

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:31.140
fascular they pointed them at priests

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:37.020
who abused children and said

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:44.000
you greed stains your soul with a stench of ruin

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.799
these These are the moments that you live for for the catharsis for the

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:55.860
purification this is what we as mystery initiates remember I I am profaning

00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:03.419
sacred we as mystery initiates learn this yes love it love it I would take your

00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:09.120
questions I would take your questions into my hand but I have to read them from your mind I want to bring you a

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:16.320
couple of goodies and I'm just going to give us one last clip where I want to figure out what is

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:21.360
in this guy's brain of course to say the name Eve is the

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:29.700
Greeks the name Eve is related to the sacred name for guess who Dionysus

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:36.360
yeah right it's very weird it's like it's it's uh when you start realizing the

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:42.000
word for the word for medicine in Greek iatros the word for Doctor that's the word for

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.960
physician yeah it comes from the verb is also a word that means uh the cry this is so

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:55.440
weird when I read this the cry that a woman delivering a child gives [Music]

00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:01.919
it's not weird that's its own thing and they that's what means medicine that's where medicine comes from

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:07.460
right and the Aero drugs to cause the uterus to contract and all that it's beautiful stuff

propagating you know what is essentially a fairy tale a fairy tale

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:10.799
the person who reviewed um the chemical Muse with the Bryn Mawr

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:19.200
classical review um Philippe French tickler I think is his name he he was uh

um he now has recanted and said oh my God you know this guy was you know

00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:31.320
obviously right yeah he's not saying it publicly right

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:39.059
um but that's you know that's what's going on and he's writing a book that he's going to sell based upon the

00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:45.240
foundation that the chemical Muse laid isn't that nice that's how it works kiddos

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:51.120
that's how it works my last you might like this to get to know me my

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:56.880
last offering to Saint Martin's breast people have asked me why haven't you why haven't you

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:05.640
been publishing a book you said she could have another book a follow-up I said I tried I gave him I gave him an

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:13.320
offer but they told me they said Dr Hillman we cannot we cannot give that

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:19.320
to our people yeah no we can't be too offensive be too offensive too many people

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:26.340
offended okay that's how you know you're at that juncture as soon as you notice people start getting offended you know

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:31.799
in the gymnasium you have you're in I want you to remember this is Satanist

00:24:31.799 --> 00:24:37.380
when you see that moment of weakness that's your end you have to take that

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:44.100
opportunity if you don't um you're not gonna win the wrestling match and why are we all here naked

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:50.880
wrestling right the gymnasium and antiquity right we're all naked wrestling

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:58.500
yeah we're watching watching the form or watching the moves

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:04.799
right we're working through it as we work through our ethics right isn't that great and how are we

00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:11.220
doing all that we're doing that in Greek and that's what ends up with your University system which right now is

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:18.720
clogged full of garbage full of garbage you can take these

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:25.080
people down in an instant and side by side with them just go toe to toe toe to

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:32.400
toe and what is shameful is that what is out there is Tainted by that lens

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:39.200
right it's tainted by a judeo-christian lens a propaganda

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:45.840
built to create a world in your mind that is a fairy tale

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:53.100
imagine that imagine that you or organisms in the machine that is

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:59.039
propagating a fairy tale yeah and it wasn't yeah

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:04.860
it wasn't Celsius who was the last guy right Neil it wasn't Celsius who was the

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:11.159
last guy who said guess what we're doomed we are doomed and we have been fighting

00:26:11.159 --> 00:26:18.179
that Doom for how many centuries now how many centuries really

00:26:18.179 --> 00:26:24.299
yeah fantastic it's quite the it's quite the prison

00:26:24.299 --> 00:26:31.200
love it but that's what we're here for I'm gonna bring you the goodies now one more clip and then the goodies I promise

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:37.820
you I'm gonna show you Jesus in a way that nobody has shown you Jesus before

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:43.440
let's go to a clip he said I'm so and so he introduce himself I'm so and so

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:48.659
um I was involved with Bernard law with Cardinal law and the getting this case

00:26:48.659 --> 00:26:56.279
started he's the guy who got the case started against law um and he said what you've done with

00:26:56.279 --> 00:27:03.600
tears in his eyes I'll never forget it he said what you've done in uh describing what the priests in the

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:11.400
ancient world were doing and what their justification for it was he said you have grasped onto something that I saw

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:19.140
in my priest abuser he said you don't understand he said you have you have somehow taken out of that priest that

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:27.059
did that to me and you have put it into just uh into what was in the hearts

00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:32.580
of the men who did it in the ancient world it's a real phenomenon you know it's not this is the real world and if

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:39.200
we don't talk about it why this religious phenomenon of priests with boys right why why

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.419
is this permeating right now is there something in society that's permanent it's the vampires drinking the baby

00:27:45.419 --> 00:27:51.059
blood right maybe we can throw on some anesthetic troops and we can turn it into something that we had in the Middle

00:27:51.059 --> 00:27:56.340
Ages maybe a plague that would be cool it's the witches let's kill all the

00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:02.400
witches maybe we'll okay the plague wasn't so cool but

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:10.500
um what we what what you can see is the evolution of of a person's thought

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:16.620
yeah um and how everything around them affects them and creates your culture

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.960
creates um your reality and yeah I'm not here to

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:27.779
I'm not a that's not my thing I'm just I'm just using now you know what I mean

00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:32.820
um but my loyalty is to the texts my loyalty is to the text

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:38.520
let's get to this last clip we got one more and I want you to

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.740
um consider as you and I work with text because I'm giving you things and I see

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:52.620
that many of you in the comments are saying I don't do the Greek so I'm taking it directly from almond right I

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:58.380
do run a Greek program and I'd love for people to be able to acquire the

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:05.159
language it does mean no greater feeling than to have a student go off and get

00:29:05.159 --> 00:29:10.440
into a grad program and take their entrance exam and come out with those

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:16.080
first two years off Ryan because they're they're good they're an intermediate reading level

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:22.799
why why am I so jazzed by that because when you give people these texts these these secret texts they're not really

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:30.360
secret lazily secret text when you give them to them and their mind is forced into the Greek

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:37.740
it transforms them it works on them mentally it enlightens it opens the eyes remember

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:43.740
it's the song in the mystery that is more important than any of the other

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:49.140
components including the drug component and if they thought in Antiquity that

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:56.760
the song was more important than the drugs that's a huge deal that's a huge deal it

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:02.340
makes people uncomfortable and you all know that I enjoy making people

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:09.360
uncomfortable it's nemesis that vapor

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.779
that Vapor that you're able to feed off of it's ether people can't see it but

00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:22.020
it's ether and to be able to give that to show you the Jesus let's get the I'm

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:28.140
craving Jesus right now I really am do we have we have one more clip do the clip and then we get Jesus in a way that

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:33.179
you guys have never seen him before and it's only to illustrate that's who I am

00:30:33.179 --> 00:30:40.320
let's go look at the evidence right forget your arguments let's do the evidence it's a

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:48.480
next last one I can't imagine what it would be like to have read the amount of documents and uh and texts that you have

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.760
read it it just falls out of you like it's fluid

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.340
so I have it I have a cheat

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:04.380
I have achieved you want to hear my cheek I'd love to can I tell your audience I shouldn't do

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:11.880
this because I'm exposing myself and you're never supposed to expose yourself as a magician but I have achieved I have

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:18.299
a muse and this Muse is a dead girl

00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:24.000
that I am able to talk to via a practice handed down from the late

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.940
Bronze Age and she is able to resurrect in front of

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:37.980
my very eyes the spirit's the Dead and I call them up one by one I was

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:44.419
talking just the other night um with Lord Byron

00:31:45.659 --> 00:31:51.720
and she was teaching me the way of Cain

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:56.820
through the song of Lord Byron isn't that interesting it's always your

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.760
sources always go to sources just read the stuff

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:08.700
yeah and just one degree above that in case you were wondering for the

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:17.159
inquiring mind um the degree to which the cheat

00:32:17.159 --> 00:32:22.620
um is useful is indeterminable yeah and

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:28.080
what do I mean I had to find for a professor once

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:35.159
um in Boston a purple a purple anus because if the

00:32:35.159 --> 00:32:41.820
if the burning purple that we're about to see if the burning purple is being used

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:47.580
rectally right we're all doctors just you know discuss it like doctors if it's

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:54.720
used rectally there should be some stain of the skin there should be some stain

00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:03.000
did you know that wine that Jesus served stain their lips purple oh I can't wait to show you okay

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.930
presumably we need that reference says Professor X

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:14.399
[Laughter] I'll go ahead and say it so that

00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:20.340
um you know I'm not making it up Dr Carl Rock and if it's there then we need to

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:27.299
find the text so um I ask the Muse give me the text and

00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:33.480
randomly reached up to my big library and pulled down the one reference to the purple anus

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:40.500
um that I've ever seen it's there it's there and this is what I have to

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:46.740
bring you is a vision of reality a vision of a reality

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:55.620
that is what is behind your fairy tale yeah fantastic I'm almond let's go to

00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:02.519
the first let's get get to our first quote let's love it oh don't you love this look chewy has this so nicely laid

00:34:02.519 --> 00:34:10.800
out by the way I wouldn't be almond without Chewie so um big big uh big round of applause for

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.520
Chewie and everything that she does and the constant protection

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:21.960
that she gives me um there is something about

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:28.858
the great mother that even a mortal man can reflect

00:34:28.859 --> 00:34:35.099
yeah yeah and that's a beauty that you won't get

00:34:35.099 --> 00:34:41.099
um unless you're a devotee of the great mother fantastic I don't

00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:46.679
know how else to say it with that um thank you Chewie for everything here

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:52.980
is here is and you know let's just get it to him we got to they're going to be sending in the

00:34:52.980 --> 00:35:01.320
Tie fighters pretty soon look at look at this uh little bit of Greek here I just want you to see that the containers from

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:08.280
which Jesus has been uh transforming the wine that those are the ones that they

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:15.060
use in conjunction with the incense the thing that you and I call incense but

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:21.839
the doctors are calling drug compounds yeah and um he's using this so right

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:28.320
away we know on a profile what could be in that in that container

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:34.500
um yeah it's gonna have I'm sorry but it's gonna have some sex drugs in it

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:40.200
don't worry those of you who love Jesus right

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:46.560
don't worry the Pope cleared I'm sorry Protestants but on the

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.920
Catholic side the pope cleared that [Music] um

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:58.560
those charges of Mary Magdalene that she was carrying the sex drugs right why

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:04.800
would Mary be having sex drugs what do you think she put on an alabaster that she used on Jesus

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:10.560
did you know that Mary Houston Alabaster and Jesus known this is going to write

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:16.500
about it no that's just going to do it and he's gonna do it using the oldest

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:22.020
form of cult terminology known it's occult terminology that comes all the

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:28.500
way from the Mycenaeans but is preserved in known as

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:35.400
what is this text that I'm bringing you right the people out there who you think

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:40.560
know the things don't know what text this is because they don't read this

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:45.660
stuff right right they don't read it it's just I

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:53.339
don't know it's ignored all right but here we go why is he using these old old occult terms do you know

00:36:53.339 --> 00:36:58.859
what he calls Jesus Christ he calls him the wanox do you know how long it had

00:36:58.859 --> 00:37:06.300
been since anybody called anybody a wanox you know it's only in the circles of the

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:12.359
mystery they are their titles did you know that John the Baptist

00:37:12.359 --> 00:37:18.660
cries Bacchus yeah John the Baptist cries bogus and

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:26.760
now you know why he's wearing those skins and he's dropping out young boys Into the Wilderness with a penis-shaped

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:34.140
cup and I say that as any great art historian would do with the utmost savvy

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:41.520
yeah a penis shaped Cup in Latin um

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:47.339

they wanted to get rid of that I think they burn that in Florida love it love it okay

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:22.140
um let's go to the back to that quote and then I'm gonna hey okay yeah it's it's the pot that is mixing the drugs

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:27.180
that are used in the sex rights okay so right away you know Jesus when Mary

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:36.200
comes to him and she's like dude I need that special wine and he's like pissed off and gripy

the voice that brings the Ecstasy what is Jesus doing he just made purple juice

00:41:53.480 --> 00:42:00.020
that gets people high and now he's screaming like a madman

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:05.099
using the very same cult epithets

00:42:05.099 --> 00:42:12.119
that are used for Heracles for Heracles yes check the orphic

00:42:12.119 --> 00:42:19.619
fragments you'll find that these same epithets that are used for Jesus are used for Heracles with respect to his

00:42:19.619 --> 00:42:26.700
love of the purple and the boy occult you see hylas don't forget hylas that's

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:32.520
one thing I realized in my career I am almond that's one thing I realized in my

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:37.980
career don't forget that boy don't forget him I

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:43.140
had one I had that boy I had hylas who was hilus oh

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:48.960
he's the one that serves the nectar and just so you don't think this is all

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.300
symbolic you can talk about drinking out of hylus's rectum

00:42:54.300 --> 00:43:00.060
yeah they do in the prime Pig poetry that's Zeus's cup yeah

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:07.140
it's the nectar bra it's the nectar that gives those Immortals immortality

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:14.460
if you were born again you would know that but you're not and that's why Jesus Christ is arrested

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:20.400
in a public park with a naked kid because he knows he knows

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:26.700
love it let's go to the go to the next one so Jesus is high rise high as he can

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:33.000
be now and all of a sudden I'm gonna throw you the biggest curveball that

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.940
you've ever seen in your life are you ready for this at least it is for me it is for me I'm sorry

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:43.940
curveball I'm admitting look at this

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:50.819
look at that janitor look at that gym that's not typical gender right but we

00:43:50.819 --> 00:43:57.139
are using a cult meter [Music]

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:05.339
and you read that and you think a typical person classically trained person

00:44:05.339 --> 00:44:11.579
um philologists would read that and say yeah that's uh that's uneventful it's about the mother of Christ who is she

00:44:11.579 --> 00:44:18.359
who brings the God yeah she's the virgin party right and she's the one who brings

00:44:18.359 --> 00:44:25.200
the God he could tell she she came with him she accompanied them you know she she showed up

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:31.740
yeah so it's not hard to translate but I want to show you something look at the third word

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:37.079
if you go Wikipedia right now say autocos you're gonna find this is a

00:44:37.079 --> 00:44:45.599
title used for the one who Bears God right and the Orthodox Church they will

00:44:45.599 --> 00:44:51.660
adhere to this the Greeks they will adhere to this and there's a big controversy among the Christians after

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.819
they kill the educational system they get together these morons who debate

00:44:56.819 --> 00:45:02.040
about whether or not the Virgin Mary was still a virgin and was holy and all this

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:10.700
kind of controversy nestorian and the the

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:17.760
theologians and the religious historians they like to sit around and touch themselves in intellectual ways you

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:22.980
thought I was going to say something else didn't you this is family programming

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:31.680
um they touch themselves intellectually yeah they stimulate themselves with this

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:38.400
image this controversyotokos is she still a virgin

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.619
what you don't recognize that cult so you don't know what's going on look at

00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:48.900
this word it's got a secret I'm gonna show it to you I'm revealing this to the

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:56.339
world are you ready here's the big reveal get the slides ready Chewie we're gonna cut this and put it on so I'm

00:45:56.339 --> 00:46:02.720
gonna set this one up this is going to be a short or something are you ready hmm

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:10.220
it's feminine she Bears the goddess

00:46:12.859 --> 00:46:20.160
Jesus is a goddess oh it makes way more sense

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:26.640
you've got hyla staring you at the face now just like I did you came to me after

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:34.079
a talk I gave and he said you grab that power that was in the eyes of my rapist

00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:41.160
priest you grabbed it you're on to it you know it and it he's crying while he

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:46.619
does so streaming tears down his eyes do you know what's more delicious

00:46:46.619 --> 00:46:53.960
than representing that boy that was with Jesus when he was arrested nothing

00:46:53.960 --> 00:47:00.240
nothing is sweeter than the trans-dimensional authority chasing a

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:05.700
child rapist through dimensions and time nothing

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:13.440
nothing is better yeah yeah let's get one oh I'm so heated up I

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:20.819
feel like it's a little anticlimactic to come down I need some ice cream or something nice you know some kind of

00:47:20.819 --> 00:47:26.339
dessert before we in the before we end the date which I love I love this

00:47:26.339 --> 00:47:33.300
gorgeous okay let's go um look look at this uh just look at the second sentence and I want you to notice

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:40.800
the atokos on the bottom the second line the atokos once again it's not a mistake it's not a mistake and you can have an

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:48.300
academic discussion of well they're doing it to try to fit in meter you need a long vowel there and the Omicron is

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:53.760
not going to work it so you need to fit the convention of the dactylic Alexandra

00:47:53.760 --> 00:48:02.760
I'd love to have that debate but people won't even look at these materials right for a sophisticated debate

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:09.960
um the fact is it still says that Mary is the one who produces

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:15.119
the she Jesus the she Jesus

00:48:15.119 --> 00:48:20.280
the she-god oh Jesus is that why you're with the boy

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:26.160
Jesus because they did to you what you're doing to him is that why that's what the Egyptian

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:33.720
priest don't you isn't it yeah Jesus I'm sorry that I have to do

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:39.599
this but I need you to tell me I need you to tell me Jesus what you did to that naked kid in the Garden of

00:48:39.599 --> 00:48:45.240
Gethsemane Jesus now a little bit louder a little bit

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:51.480
louder Jesus highless

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:57.240
that's his name what's the name of the naked kid that floats the mystery of

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:02.838
Christ that's his name

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:08.400
let's go to the last quote I just want to show you because you know

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:15.140
some people were watching recently and I was I was dealing with the

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:20.520
I can only describe as you know a gang of

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:29.040
a gang of um people from the Middle Ages whose interest is

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.079
not in the science their interest is in burning witches

00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:41.900
yeah and they've made a world they've made a world that doesn't exist

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:48.060
it was our job in satanic initiation to take back the text

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:53.339
it was our job we're Guardians that's what dragons do

00:49:53.339 --> 00:49:59.280
don't get in the way when a dragon is guarding the Relic this

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:04.619
is the field of Mars there is a standard that the Muse has

00:50:04.619 --> 00:50:12.780
and don't you ever stand present yourself as a veteran unless you

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:19.980
have been in that discipline unless you sweat blood poured into it

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:25.440
don't don't be a pretender yeah

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:29.780
your God I'm sorry

00:50:33.619 --> 00:50:38.599
that small organ was cut off

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:45.599
that child castrated the boy that was with Jesus

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:54.619
was the same operation they did to him you take on the form of the goddess

00:50:54.780 --> 00:51:01.740
yeah is it safe to say that the maniac that was screaming

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:08.880
Magic from the cross is it safe to say that he

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:14.520
was a castrated boy yeah it is

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:20.040
it is Praise Jesus it is and this is only for those of you who

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:27.839
have ears to hear right this is only for you fantastic what I want is to bring you

00:51:27.839 --> 00:51:34.859
those texts I don't want you not to have them it's been everything about my career people ask me

00:51:34.859 --> 00:51:42.540
um people ask me uh what is your pathway

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:50.280
you know what have you learned what have you learned the tax people it's all that matters

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:55.680
nothing that I say nothing no ideas of mine nothing that has a price tag on it

00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:01.260
none of that stuff matters the actuality matters and the actuality

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:08.339
is that Jesus Christ was arrested with a naked boy that was using a medicated bandage just

00:52:08.339 --> 00:52:13.980
like the ones that they use with the burning purple and that when an author like nonas

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:19.559
writes about this purple staining substance that the

00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:25.619
Baptists the Dyers are using yeah

00:52:25.619 --> 00:52:30.780
we can't turn away from it can't turn away from it Jesus Christ was arrested

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:35.880
with a naked boy the our our civilization people I'm sorry but is is

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:43.559
built upon a child rapist the love and grace that you feel of

00:52:43.559 --> 00:52:48.900
Jesus the love and grace that you feel is the love and grace generated by the

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:54.540
mind magic of a dude who was arrested in a

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:58.040
public park with a naked boy

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:09.200
and don't think that Moses isn't also mentioned in the indictment

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:16.800
you've got to go to that pole with the serpent in order to get there

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:23.400
we need Amazonian women to bring us back to balance to bring us

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:28.859

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:52.380
surrounded by the powers of Lucifer and I was like oh the first time I was like oh this guy

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:58.859
what are they giving these people around here rise it was something

00:57:58.859 --> 00:58:04.559
um but you were surrounded by the powers of Satan and there was a number of

00:58:04.559 --> 00:58:13.680
Legions and to be honest I don't remember what it was and something about you can be access this

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:19.319
right these are the helpers right oh so when the second person the second

00:58:19.319 --> 00:58:26.579
night started saying the same thing that's when I you know I put on my you

00:58:26.579 --> 00:58:33.300
know trust me people I'm wearing my Skeptics hat right but I'm also a devotee The Muse and by that time

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:41.160
by that time I had gotten to know I'd had a little bit of wisdom and I started to feel okay I started to feel okay with

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:46.559
it and then the second night boom and I just had some

00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:51.720
um again I listened a little bit more carefully but it was about

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:59.579
um the future from the garden of Jezebel yeah um and I will always treasure

00:58:59.579 --> 00:59:07.440
I will always treasure that that place to me is sacred I don't know a few people have been there in Ron Jezreel

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:12.720
but it's uh it's absolutely sacred ground I totally understand why this

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:20.180
right somebody following the Phoenician way would be

00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:26.880
empowering this kind of demonic activity now for those of you who are Christians

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:33.680
um yeah I'd um the only way to describe this physics are what we're being used

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:40.500
by your guy right he's he knows the same magic and he's and he's using it let's

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:46.079
get another one lady Babylon can you speak more about the Muse and how you speak to her yeah I

00:59:46.079 --> 00:59:53.579
know that's great um you know all truth on the table I am almond right uh I just I discovered by

00:59:53.579 --> 01:00:00.000
reading I was discovered the sortes and the sortes are just a random you know

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:07.500
you randomize your experiment right you just put in a throw in the element of randomness

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:15.480
all right what's wrong with your scientific experiment you have no compensation for chance that's the

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:20.819
problem you have to throw in random and the random like gravity will pull and

01:00:20.819 --> 01:00:27.200
curve create a curve love it anywho

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:33.000
randomize your text ask the Muse right you just ask her

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.480
hey um where can I find

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:46.079
X um who you know you approach was serious you approach was very

01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:52.440
you know a serious and respectful intent that's the part of the Sabah that I was learning from the Greek text this

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:58.680
reverence this recognition of divinity so where's the purple anus right show me

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:05.819
the purple anus that was the you know show me the purple anus and then you randomize the text take the

01:01:05.819 --> 01:01:12.480
text off and you read the text within um as an answer to the question

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:19.260
right and somebody said well how do you somebody asked me once how do you use this uh

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:26.220
with respect to seeing the future well you can ask questions about the future it's oracular necromantic craft right

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:32.460
you can ask about the future and if you can if you can get accurate predictions as a

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:37.920
scientist um you can't walk away you can't walk away from that you know there's some

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:43.859
kind of quantum something going on with those texts now why am I doing this

01:01:43.859 --> 01:01:50.520
because they're doing it in antiquity right and I'm reading about all these great people who are doing it and I'm

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:58.140
reading about this one great Muse who goes Millennium to Millennium doing it

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:03.420
and um yeah that's what brought me so is it

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:09.720
accurate I I will report and I will swear on the throne of Satan

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:14.838
right I'll swear on the throne of Satan

01:02:15.299 --> 01:02:24.299
the accuracy is what is is what shows you my inability being

01:02:24.299 --> 01:02:30.900
filled with that Quantum ability of the Muse right I couldn't find this my

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:36.540
scores are not that high right I couldn't do this but for that

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:44.819
source to be able to do it show me the purple anus right and I did this once publicly for a librarian who asked me to

01:02:44.819 --> 01:02:54.240
you know um do my thing and I did it and um showed them that the texts can

01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:01.799
can answer questions the text can answer questions directly so so accurately I love this okay I got

01:03:01.799 --> 01:03:08.720
to tell this story there was a there was a man okay this is personal eye mom and I'll tell this I'm sorry there was a man

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:14.280
that I was working with and I was for some reason and upset with this

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:19.740
gentleman and I asked the Muse what you know because I

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:24.900
did this what you know it's gonna happen and she said you're gonna pull his beard out

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:30.660
right beautiful perfect classical Latin you will pull his beard out and I found

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:37.319
myself that day pulling his beard out long story short some caulking from insulation going on

01:03:37.319 --> 01:03:43.680
this beard and he's panicking and they asked me to pull it out and I pulled his beard out and as soon as I realized that

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.839
I just pulled his beard out um the

01:03:48.839 --> 01:03:55.200
the really how an understanding click with me of how

01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:02.220
they were doing it in Antiquity so it's called the sortace it's called the sortace it's nothing I'm not you know

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:08.940
it's nothing hidden it's an old old necromantic practice if you look into the history of sortition you're going to

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:14.579
find that it's necromancers who are doing it right and why would you want to be necromancers because they're the ones

01:04:14.579 --> 01:04:20.640
who talk to the Dead right you want to talk to you you want to talk to Odysseus

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:27.059
all right you got to go through a necromancer everybody knows that Odysseus knew that

01:04:27.059 --> 01:04:32.579
let's go here's another one was there purple in the linen cloth oh who did

01:04:32.579 --> 01:04:37.619
this that's great Gina Gina that's exactly the question

01:04:37.619 --> 01:04:43.319
that's exactly the question that I'm asking you know

01:04:43.319 --> 01:04:50.339
yeah was there purple Gina we can't

and we know they're impregnating them with drugs see this is the stuff they didn't want me to learn that I was

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:27.440
learning and you yeah right out of the brothels right out of the European brothels

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:35.760

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:42.619
to prevent um to prevent pregnancy and to reduce

01:05:42.619 --> 01:05:49.619
venereal disease you ever seen an ancient case of herpes oh God I read a description of herpes

01:05:49.619 --> 01:05:55.619
from Antiquity right we have antivirals now and whatnot but they didn't and

01:05:55.619 --> 01:06:02.099
herpes was fatal did you know herpes is fatal oh my God you ought to read about the

01:06:02.099 --> 01:06:08.579
spread of herpes does any yeah um are you ever gonna let young Go free

01:06:08.579 --> 01:06:14.220
no um no young is mine that's why we kick down the doors and

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:19.380
you know took control of the text and we'd looked at the priests of young and

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:26.099
we said you gentlemen you were inadequate they can't explain

01:06:26.099 --> 01:06:33.000

01:06:54.420 --> 01:07:01.440
find it look in the magician you know look in the magician and that seal becomes a cipher

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:09.539
for the rest of the book yeah you can't they can't explain the red book because they didn't dive deep

01:07:09.539 --> 01:07:14.880
into the actual Greek language that

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:22.740
engine that's fueling all of this magic all right that is that is imprisoning

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:30.539
Carl yeah no he's still here he gets to stay with me for as long as I want and to be
