00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.940
below the horizon there was a banquet

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:00.860

special bond between an adult and they're fostering child

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.240

Judas is Jesus's Foster son yeah

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.620

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:30.300
realize now that Jesus's students um were amazed quite easily on a regular

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:37.380
basis or remember their ages right remember their ages and you say well no wonder I always thought he was

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.660
treating the apostles like they were stupid yeah no he was treating him like they

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:50.340

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:25.620
Techna how is he addressing his followers how is he addressing him you can take it down he's addressing them as

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:33.959
children would be very odd for a grown man to keep addressing a group group of grown

00:08:33.959 --> 00:08:41.459
men uh with the you know we're children my little sheepies over and over and

00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:48.300
over you would think we would have picked that up many years ago right it's only the naked kid that was

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:54.839
with Jesus when he was arrested that makes us start to think about kids anyway okay let's get let's go to the

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:57.299
clothes and what what does he do he picks up a towel and he wraps it around himself

00:19:57.299 --> 00:20:02.640
he picks up some kind of towel cloth and he wraps it around himself

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:09.120
okay fantastic let's keep going I know people that we've looked at some of this before but I need to set up the

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:14.160
poisoning right the drugging that Jesus did yeah and so he pours that water into

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:21.240
the vase I mean into the Basin it's like a catch basin yeah and then he began to watch wash the

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.460
feet of the students right if anybody in

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.919
here who has students ever ended up naked and washing their

00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:38.580
feet they'd be thrown into prison right this is this is the big event that we're

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:46.140
making paintings about people this is the very last one of these Banquets that we're gonna have right

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:52.520
because things catch up with Jesus um there's a reason the crowd's yelling you know crucifying

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:59.820
okay let's um go to the next one please yeah and here we are so it comes to Simon Peter

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:06.419
he's going to wash his feet right and Peter says don't wash my feet here's the next one just don't wash my feet and

00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:13.260
Jesus answers them back and he says he says look the thing that I'm doing you don't

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:18.539
understand it now yeah but you'll know later

00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:23.820
and when you do now this is that's the end of the verse but you know when he

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:29.640
does figure out he's gonna be able to groom the Next

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:36.600

still going to end up kissing Judas right okay okay let's go back to the

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:24.900
text see what it says we're almost to the poisoning people thanks for hanging in there with me for so long we're gonna

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:30.000

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:40.320
ready it's text from Antiquity donkey so worked up

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:47.520
there's the text yes let's go back um so he says

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.980
after he's gone through all of this wash their feet made us all very

00:23:52.980 --> 00:24:01.260
uncomfortable right nobody here has washed the feet naked of a bunch of boys have you I

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:08.220
don't know do you have a youth thing that does this I don't know but if you do you're probably worried about getting

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:15.720
caught which is a good thing supposed to discourage that right Jesus rode that

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:24.419
wave Gangsta G was not gonna let that stop him from taking care of his boys

00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:30.000
now let's go to the next text I love it what happens here yeah so he

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:38.220
says look I'm not going to be here for long and you're going to come looking for me right and like I was saying to those

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:44.460
Jews wait what you know this is the Bible people John 13 33.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:51.480
13 33. Jesus Christ

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:57.419
says like the other day when I was telling those Jews

00:24:57.419 --> 00:25:04.559
you can't follow me where I'm going wait a minute wait a minute

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:10.080
two possibilities referring to somebody else's ethnicity

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:16.020
to distinguish from your own or from your audience's ethnicity

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:23.400
yeah which is more likely probably the kids who aren't Jews

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:29.340
yeah otherwise it makes them sound like he's a little stupid

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:36.360
yeah yeah huh just a little note I just want you

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:43.620
to see that little bump in the text like yeah you know a lot of this kind of stuff can happen through scribal error

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:52.200
right a lot of that kind of stuff can happen so I'm not gonna make a big deal about the identity thing let's go

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:59.580
um look at this and um so you know there was this kid lying back right right one

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:07.679
of his students lying back look at that second line in toy culpoy that's on the lap on the lap of Jesus and he was the

00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:15.200
one that Jesus loved he was the one that Jesus loved he's sitting on Jesus's lap

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:21.120
and remember as Jesus is washing and he's uh we're gonna see this you're gonna freak When You See It Go ahead

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:27.779
next one yeah and what um what do you do this kid lie back he just he just put

00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:35.279
his head back where Jesus is at the level of Jesus's breasts right the level of his breasts so again

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:41.940
that's how tall the kid is that's leaning on him and he says who is it because Jesus has been saying one of you

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:48.120
one of you boys is gonna betray me one of my little sheepkins is gonna betray

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.940
me right almost like he's setting it up

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:59.820
you ever feel like he was maybe setting it up there's lots of Watch What Happens here

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:06.299
um next text look at this and whoops and um so we'll take it down for a second so

00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:12.299
what does Jesus do he says I'll show you who it is the one

00:27:12.299 --> 00:27:20.279

he does what he baptizes it with just a couple of little drops of the purple

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:41.580
and he gives it to him and when he gives it to him when he gives them the intheon arton

with the burning purple he goes nuts he goes nuts

00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:00.299

prostitutes now you understand why Mary has the sex drugs

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:05.778
now you understand why they call the semen of Jesus the love of God

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:15.480
you are sitting there and you are not a Christian

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.519
unless you are abusing children the only true

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:27.000
Christian today are those creepy priests they're the only ones those creepy youth

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.820
pastors they're the only ones all the rapist Baptists that you can

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:38.600
find they're the real Christians yes no

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:44.220
this is a religion that is founded by a

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:49.860
pedophile perpetuating a rape ritual

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:55.740
and I'm not the one saying it notices I didn't make this up all I'm doing is

00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:01.080

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:13.020
back to that one yeah yeah oh and um by the way this one describes after he

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:18.780
shows his flesh right what does he do he makes a kind of a false me train he

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:25.378
makes a false ladies girdle now around his pube region yeah and he ties it off

00:34:25.379 --> 00:34:32.580
good with a sh with a strong knot kind of thing yeah and it's kind of in a fashion that's coming out of the tombs

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:39.118
yeah this and lintion thing that he's using but what is it what is it says

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:46.158
Anonymous he says it's that cure cure of those

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:51.300
ikmadic feet cure the icmotic feet

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:56.878
yeah you remember that stuff that he's putting from the washing from the kids

00:34:56.879 --> 00:35:03.599
yeah when you talk about purifications and mystery

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:12.000
um you have to remember that the first mystery Queen lady Babylon herself the medwa the queen of caucus you got to

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:19.020
remember that those rituals have to do with the creation of fluids

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:24.060
that can be used within the within the religion within the mystery

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:31.320
right it's lady babylon's cup of her own sexual juices that is the

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:37.079
right when they bathed Medea they collected the water

00:35:37.079 --> 00:35:45.599
they didn't have a bath they washed her and collected the offrunnings and

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:53.040
distributed those as medicine yeah you mean Medea was so jacked with

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.079
so many drugs even coming out of her culpos

00:35:58.079 --> 00:36:05.460
when she takes care of Jason people you know where she gets the drugs that make Jason and vulnerable to Fire and to pain

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:12.180
she gets them out of her vagina right it's the medicine of the time if

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:17.579
you got a problem with a sorcery then I don't care but Jesus is in the midst of

00:36:17.579 --> 00:36:26.220
that he's in the midst of it with these kids let's go to the next text we're almost done oh yes we've got we've got a wrap

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:32.339
look um but I want to give you the goodies that were here um just so you can see

00:36:32.339 --> 00:36:38.040
um what is he doing what is Jesus doing at this point this isn't now this is

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:44.400
um summation or paraphrasing of John right he says he pours out that water

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:51.540
that Hoople on water the water that comes from below the lap

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:57.960
the water that comes from below the lap right oh wait a minute are we getting

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:04.079
Theo are we getting Vox orifica

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:09.300
yeah guess what we're about to see it with the messengers as Jesus describes

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:15.060
why he drugged Judas um just notice here that uh um yeah he

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:22.320
he's washing their feet again dirty guy I just want him to see the wall that comes with a lap and I want you to notice that second and third word

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:28.440
yeah okay let's let's keep going let's we need to we need to get on um

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:34.140
yeah I'm gonna skip that one too but I want you to notice that the bottom oystery thin taste this is more of

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:40.200
John's gospel talking about other people that entered an ecstatic phase and these

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:46.800
people were the ones that were doing it because they were accepting the Christ at the well in Samaria when he's when

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:55.800
the kids when the kid Apostles are all like why is he talking to that woman yeah right Water of Life stuff it's

00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:03.119
driving them crazy it's typical cult stuff people you don't see this because we've seen only the fairy tale right you

00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:10.560
expect the church to give you the the historical reality no they're gonna convey whatever gives to you you know

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:16.320
any religion is going to Orthodox Judaism is that's all Orthodox Judaism is

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:23.220
is an attempt at propaganda to control that's all Orthodox anything

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:32.640
is anything Orthodox is an attempt to set parameters about what is Right teaching

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:40.560
orthodox right so that's all that they do that's why you have Bible studies right it's

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.900
why you have Bibles haven't you ever wondered why classes study just ancient

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:52.560
literature except for the Bible and then you have an entire department where people study just the Bible out of its

00:38:52.560 --> 00:39:00.060
context it's because they want to control the propaganda yeah that's Orthodox right there I don't care

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:06.240
if you're one of the Taliban you're controlling it when you threaten girls by saying I'm gonna throw acid in your

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.599
face that's all you're doing that's all you're doing

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:17.339
let's go love ex love the exposure get it get the get the next one up oh okay

00:39:17.339 --> 00:39:22.859
so Jesus is yeah what's going on here oh yeah he says with the hand so he says in

00:39:22.859 --> 00:39:28.200
the hand that I'm you know um I'm gonna give um the one

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:34.740
um who's gonna betray me with this thing that I've baptized that I've soaked what have you soaked it in Jesus in these

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:40.680
little drops in these little drops these little drops they're infused these

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:47.700
little drops that are infused with that wine dark or wine faced literally with

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:55.800
that purple those purple drops yeah now again this is Vox orphica go

00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:01.859
back I need to see that again please Joy this is Vox orphica right the one that

00:40:01.859 --> 00:40:08.339
I'm giving it to right I'm giving these infused with the

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:15.180
purple and this one is gonna do exactly what I set up for him to do

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:20.579
all right this is masterful manipulation it's brilliant right he's gonna do it

00:40:20.579 --> 00:40:27.960
himself go to the next one I think we skipped one that we're gonna do but um I think um okay go down to the fourth line

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:34.200
okay I met the fescalon arton right and after now this is where the

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:39.660
Diabolical part gives in right so immediately immediately upon giving him

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:47.520
that Divine bread remember he he says theskalon it's like it's inspired the

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:52.680
bread of inspiration the stuff will knock you down right you'd be inspired

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:57.720
so what does it say he does with it it says after he gave him that that was

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:03.720
sprinkled that was that he had sprinkled in what did he sprinkle into it he sprinkled in

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:14.460
pothon sire for ecstasy the desire for Bliss

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:22.680
what Jesus put in that bread and gave to that kid he says will cause him

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:29.520
to have a desire a drive a passion for

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:35.280
Bliss okay okay

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:41.880
um kind of creepy you know you might expect that from Bill Cosby right I'm going to take him to the zone I'm gonna

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:48.240
take him to the he's given it to him and immediately the kid gets up and was that

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:55.160
nope yep and uh

00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:01.859
oh and he says what happens he gives him that bread right that's that that bread

00:42:01.859 --> 00:42:07.380
of power and what happens to him he become that bread it becomes the

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:14.960
messenger the messenger of this overwhelming greed and

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:21.839
with this you know after administration of this thing with its desire for Bliss

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:29.280
pompous pompous diamond the diamond and that's the devil that

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:36.480
he's talking about when he says satanas that's the devil the devil enters completely into him

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:45.780
ES a messenger or a carrier a carrier

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:52.500
of sin carrier of sin uh Jesus could you

00:42:52.500 --> 00:43:00.599
explain that to me one more time yeah you give him the drug and the devil enters into them voila

00:43:00.599 --> 00:43:07.260
possession yeah haven't you been paying attention he's been talking to the devil the whole

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:14.400
time right he's like goodbye right now he's using it and now you know

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:19.740
why the religious Jews that are there say this dude is casting out demons by

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:25.920
the power of Beelzebub yeah right that's the devil

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:33.119
all right that's the devil's power he's the one who initiates that this is his kingdom right Jesus knows that he's just

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:38.520
using the physics and he's using it with his boys if you want to enter the Kingdom of Heaven

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:44.579
you've got to become a boy go to the last example I just want to

00:43:44.579 --> 00:43:51.780
finish up with this and then we'll call we'll call Gnostic inform it up and see he's got some great stuff I'm gonna throw the floor to him I just underline

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:58.140
a couple of things here I just want you to see this is from noticesiaka and I just want you to see

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:05.660
that it's describing a group of women who have put upon their breasts

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:12.660
these Iron Bowls and these bowls are used in the creation of drugs they

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:19.260
preserve the Divine milk of these women who were suited in armor they're suited

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:26.400
in armor over their breasts and their breasts are called breasts

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:31.279
that bring the Mystic initiation

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:38.220
isn't that nice do you know what we want we don't want that drug from Jesus we

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:44.160
don't want that bread that's going to make us flip out and do exactly what he's programmed us to do we don't want

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:51.060
that we don't want that we want that milk we want that milk would you be surprised

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:59.160
if we found out it had the purple you you may you may now before we bring in Neil I

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:06.480
just want to say um to all the fundamentalist religions in in the west oh they're in the East

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:12.300
now too um in the east and west to all the fundamentalist religions

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:19.319
you who are people of the book particularly you people of the book

00:45:19.319 --> 00:45:25.619
your book is the product of a mystery ride

00:45:25.619 --> 00:45:32.880
that involves the rape of children yeah from Moses to Jesus

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:41.220
we're all into the Venom yeah yeah tonight we want to call in we want to

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:47.099
call in the Gnostic informant is the Gnostic informant here yes yes well I'm

00:45:47.099 --> 00:45:52.260
gonna I'm gonna shut up for a minute and if you would just take over and give us

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:57.960
what you've got Neil I'm giving you the floor thanks for coming tonight thank you I wanted to talk about the

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:05.040
purple that you mentioned so is there the question is if this is what Jesus was doing

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:11.579
did this tradition continue at all and where do we have evidence of it so I have a I have a text about Marcus madius

00:46:11.579 --> 00:46:16.980
second century so this is early this is the first well let's just say

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:22.740
second generations of Christians after you know the first generation of the first century Christians

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:28.920
all right I got a screen down there I'm sharing there it is and this is about Marcus madis he's the student of

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:35.099
valentinus and valentinus claims to be a student of John so that's that's the

00:46:35.099 --> 00:46:43.619
tradition that's what all the historians like eusebius and all them are saying about the line of how how close are they

00:46:43.619 --> 00:46:51.000
to Jesus he's three away Jesus John valentinus and Marcus madius so Marcus

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:58.920
matches is over in Rome he's very high up he'd be like considered a cardinal today it's extremely popular and I just

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:04.280
want to make one more thing clear before I read this he was never in his lifetime

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:09.780
charged with heresy he was extremely popular during his lifetime it's not

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:16.980
until a century later century and a half later where an Orthodoxy became begins to form

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:22.380
and like Dr Amma was saying orthodoxies come along and they they hijack these

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:27.660
these wild movements and they sort of uh they corporate corporatize them

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:34.380
basically so he becomes a he becomes a heretic way later when it becomes

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:41.520
convenient it's very important to know that so the things the things he's doing here are considered normal Christian

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:47.760
practice for the church at Rome okay Vatican basically so it says

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:53.880
another among them Marcus an Adept in sorcery carrying on operations partly by

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:58.920
sleight of hand and partly by demons deceive many from time to time this

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:05.819
heretic alleged that remember this is written by a guy way later alleged that there resided in him the mightiest power

00:48:05.819 --> 00:48:12.359
from invisible and unnamable places very often taking the cup as it offering

00:48:12.359 --> 00:48:17.579
up the Eucharistic prayer and prolonging to a great length than usual word of

00:48:17.579 --> 00:48:24.480
invocation he would cause the appearance of the purple and sometimes red mixture so that his

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:32.400
dupes imagine that a certain Grace descended on the communicated to the potion of a blood red potency the knave

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:40.380
however at the time succeeded in escaping detection from many but now being convicted of the Imposter he will

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:46.319
be forced to assist from it for infusing secretly into the mixture some drug that

00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:54.420
possessed the power of imparting such a color the purple as alluded above uttering for

00:48:54.420 --> 00:49:01.920
a considerable time nonsensical Expressions we all know what this is this is mania this is a revelry

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:07.920
he was in the habit of Wade waiting in expectation that the drug obtaining a

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:15.240
supply of moisture might be dissolved and being intermingled with the potion that might impart its color to it the

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:21.180
drugs however that possess the quality of Furnishing this effect we had previously mentioned in the book on

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:26.700
magicians so basically he's talking about this Marcus Magis character is

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:32.040
drugging people during the Eucharist and what would happen was if you continue to

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:38.460
read the next page he basically says like these people would go into bakic frenzies they would go into these states

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:45.359
of of euphoria and psychedelia psychedelia and then he would tell them that's the spirit of God who descended

00:49:45.359 --> 00:49:51.720
on you that's the Holy Spirit that's Jesus and there's guys snitching on him as if

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:58.560
he's a heretic but if this guy if it wasn't in the in the in the cards to make this guy a heretic

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:05.160
the political situation didn't present itself and this guy was part of the Orthodoxy you'd never know this Texas

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:10.260
you would never know this practice ever existed does that make sense now go

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:18.119
ahead yeah no no that's an excellent excellent point there's there for some reason he's not just making it up and

00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:24.119
you know it matches the Traditions that we have with it it's exactly what you would expect so beautiful evidence love

00:50:24.119 --> 00:50:29.460
it now real quick I want to point something out so keep that in mind when you're looking

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:35.819
at John 13 like you know some people will say this is not this isn't historical this is

00:50:35.819 --> 00:50:41.040
this is a legend it's like okay why is the author saying

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:47.460
that Jesus had to dip the bread in the dish and give it to Judas in order for Satan

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:54.119
to enter him what is the author even trying to say there to me it's a it's it's tomato

00:50:54.119 --> 00:51:00.359
tomato it doesn't even make a difference because whether it's attributing this to Jesus or if it actually happened

00:51:00.359 --> 00:51:07.079
it's like what's going on here are you is are they showing you this is like some sort of tradition to get people in

00:51:07.079 --> 00:51:13.020
the state um and one more thing I want to show this is from this is also this is from

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:19.859
John from John 19 same author same text and when he's on he's on the cross

00:51:19.859 --> 00:51:25.920
right and he says I'm thirsty and they give him a sponge of vinegar on the

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:31.859
stock of a hissa plant right and uh real quick before I show you what

00:51:31.859 --> 00:51:36.960
a hisop plant is down here is a weird thing that happens

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:43.859
when they see when he sees his mother where is it sit down here all right here

00:51:43.859 --> 00:51:50.819
he sees his mother and then he says to his mother oh by the way this is a disciple who I

00:51:50.819 --> 00:51:56.760
my beloved disciple the one that sits on Jesus's shoulder and he says woman here

00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:02.819
is your new son wait a minute your new son

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:09.300
what have you married is this your me is this a mother his new mother-in-law because you're married to this child

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:15.599
what's going on here that's a weird thing to happen why would your beloved disciple have

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:21.180
this become your mother your mother's son

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:27.059
weird just say it now I want to show you last thing I want to show you what a hissile plant looks like because this ties it all together

00:52:27.059 --> 00:52:32.160
this is the hissap plant purple of course

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:37.940
it's always purple all the drugs are always purple you ever notice that

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:43.260
wow even the text that I brought from Marcus

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:48.500
Magis he says it was a purple substance yeah yeah something's going on with that

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:54.920
yeah you say The Acacia Thorn is also isn't that a purple produces a purple

00:52:54.920 --> 00:53:01.680
Acacia and mimosa hostilis plant barks when you blend it up so it looks like a

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:07.559
bark but then when you blend it up and and get it to a fine powder and add

00:53:07.559 --> 00:53:14.579
a little bit of water it completely turns purple dark red blood red purple like like the color behind me

00:53:14.579 --> 00:53:20.460
turns into that nice nice okay Neil tell me

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:27.000
um uh having brought in that Source um what do you think the broader world

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:34.500
out there will think you're we're beginning to see uh you know the kind of the stripped of all it's Disneyland

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:41.099
we're seeing Jesus with prostitutes we're seeing him take use these kids

00:53:41.099 --> 00:53:48.119
um how do we take this message to the world how do we do we do it with this just this scholarly approach what are we

00:53:48.119 --> 00:53:54.240
doing here are we you know we have an audience the audience is engaging um what do you think I'm just you know

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:59.520
what's your vision keep bringing sources out keep bringing the sources out I was

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:05.339
just talking to someone before this about Jeremiah the book Jeremiah and

00:54:05.339 --> 00:54:14.520
they're the the people just assume this book was written in 650 BC okay interesting so that's that's the

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:20.760
case it should be cited it should be passed around it should have spread somewhere by the by the time we get to

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:28.020
the third Century BC this text should be well known right no I'm like okay well can we can we get

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:35.220
a citation of this text can we get it can we get something I mean I just want to see something because I'll believe you I'm not being biased against this

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:43.020
text being dated to this time and they'll say well Jeremiah takes place in the time of King Hezekiah okay so did

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:48.599
Daniel Daniel lived in the time of belshazzar but we figured out that

00:54:48.599 --> 00:54:54.839
Daniel has clear knowledge of what happens in the Hellenistic world so we

00:54:54.839 --> 00:55:01.140
know Daniel's a later text being backdated in fact a lot of people point out that prophecy is a genre

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:06.180
it's like the sibling text they're backdated to show what happened so why

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:12.780
wouldn't you say the same thing for Jeremiah and that's just funny and then he says and then someone else said um I'm

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:19.800
talking to someone else about it too and this person points out that there's a a rock that somebody found under the

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:24.960
city of David and on The Rock was there a name of somebody

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:31.140
the name was like yeah rukim son of somebody that's all it says on the Rock

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:36.240
can't date it it's not carbon dateable right so you just gotta look at the the

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:41.640
the inscription and it just looks like some regular Hebrew from any time and it

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:46.920
has this person's name on it well it turns out that in the book of Zechariah this is going to blow your mind you're

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:52.500
gonna this is gonna you're gonna be like what this is laughable in the book of Zechariah somewhere in this book it

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:58.200
mentions a guy with that same name so they took they said since Zechariah

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:03.420
is dated to 650 that this rock must be from 650.

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:09.440
because a guy's name is on it that with the same name that's in Zechariah where's

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.880
the standard of like of like the the Historical Method and scientific meth

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:21.240
where where why come when we get to Bible studies that all goes out the window like you mentioned the class of six

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:26.520
department is a whole different world you're going to get to try to get a PhD in Classics you better you're gonna have

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:31.619
to know Greek you have to know different languages then you for to get a PhD in like some

00:56:31.619 --> 00:56:39.000
Bible studies you get a master of divinity which is nothing Master Divinity is laughable and

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.760
then you get you take that Master Divinity and you just get like a PhD in some random studying Daniel or something

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:49.800
from it's a way easier PhD is what I'm saying I'm not saying it ain't easy I haven't

00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:55.380
done it so who am I to talk but I'm just saying it's a different world than Classics and I don't think anyone I

00:56:55.380 --> 00:57:01.859
don't think anyone would disagree with me on that when you now you know my classes have

00:57:01.859 --> 00:57:09.119
the same reaction to Bible scholars right because yeah it's not really real right when you can date something like

00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:15.480
that from a absurdity I mean okay if we did that with the rest of History we

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:21.359
would be so confused and you could say anything you were you'd make any argument you wanted you know no there's

00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:28.140
a standard Neil's pointing out and that standard is the text we have that thing preserved do you think archaeologists

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:34.440
make stuff up they're trying to figure out from the dirt they're from getting that evidence there we have that with

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:39.540
Classics too we have that evidence so it's all about handling that evidence

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:46.319
people and you've seen them we showed you they're using the drugs they're in these sex rights the Christians are

00:57:46.319 --> 00:57:52.200
doing it Jesus is doing it what you know how many naked boys am I gonna have to

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:57.660
find associated with Jesus before somebody says huh maybe you know maybe

00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:03.660
this guy is right you know we should go back and look at it um Neil how many years give me a number

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:10.680
one between one and ten how many years before what you and I are doing is gonna actually catch up to the academics where

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:16.020
they're gonna say oh wait a minute it's a good question I was talking about Derek I was talking with Derek about

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:22.319
that and I think it's going to be it's only a matter of time before they're gonna have to they're gonna have to engage with this stuff the more the more

00:58:22.319 --> 00:58:29.280
people that come up and say the same thing like Russell caberkin from a whole different point of reference is coming

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:36.780
to the same conclusion as you and me and other and a few others so eventually you don't you want to to

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:43.319
prove us wrong if you like if everything you everything that you guys are have consensusly on

00:58:43.319 --> 00:58:50.339
consensus on if it's so Rock Solid if it's so well slam dunk no but with this

00:58:50.339 --> 00:58:58.859
we know these dates now then shouldn't you be able to just lay something out for me that I can't defend right

00:58:58.859 --> 00:59:06.059
so I think it's I think it'd be short couple years two three years good I hope you're right man I hope

00:59:06.059 --> 00:59:11.819
you're right and I hope this type of the new museum with this new technology I

00:59:11.819 --> 00:59:16.980
hope it catapults things forward thank you if you need a YouTube for let you

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:24.720
know letting people do this did you know that to get a master Divinity you have to sign a statement of faith

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:30.720
did you know this is that it there's sbl seminarians they have to sign a

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:36.480
statement of faith can I pull it up can I pull it up and show people of

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:42.240
course go ahead go ahead fine all right because think about this why is this

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:47.880
there okay so somebody tried to tell me it's not that big of a deal Neil could stop

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:53.640
it they're just doing it because you know whatever whatever well then why are

00:59:53.640 --> 01:00:00.299
they doing it like you're telling me that I have to sign on a piece of paper and lie if I so if I don't plan on give

01:00:00.299 --> 01:00:05.760
being faithful then I'm gonna lie I'm gonna sign something and lie to you and

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:11.640
if I do want to be faithful then I'm signing something to say that I'm going to lie to other people

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:18.000
because if I find something that goes against my beliefs then I have to say it I don't believe it so why why why should

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:26.000
anyone take anything that sbl says seriously look at this discussing faith and reason

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:33.240
um oh I think this is like some sort of like oh okay so this is them this is an art this is from the SPL site saying

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:38.579
that uh basically saying because they're getting a bunch of complaints from people saying you guys are signing

01:00:38.579 --> 01:00:45.540
statements of Faith what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right so here's them saying like no we don't

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:50.579
does it mean anything no it's not a big deal look all these people sign these

01:00:50.579 --> 01:00:58.380
things saying they they take their work serious okay big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude sorry but like that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is just not

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:05.640
cutting it for me like I'm sorry why is it there I'm just saying am I being crazy for asking why that's

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.740
there no no no no no I think do you think it's maybe this kind of similar to

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:18.119
the Apostles Creed I mean they came up with that pretty early too like it's the what is that stuff for when you make a

01:01:18.119 --> 01:01:26.220
mantra that everybody has to follow it that's just control isn't it it is like you're you're putting someone

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:32.220
in a position no matter what they're gonna you're saying you need to be a liar not think

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:37.980
now before you say I'm being like unfair here let's run run this down

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:44.700
you're a Christian okay you're a Christian you get your master of divinity you go to you sign your your

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:51.240
statement of faith now you're you're basically signing on a piece of paper that if I find evidence

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:57.960
that goes against my faith I have to reject it you're telling someone to do that now if I'm if I really just wanted

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:03.780
to get this if I'm really just trying to get a PhD as a Bible scholar and I don't really have faith right let's say I'm a

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:10.260
real critical scholar you're still making me sign it and because I'm not going to go along

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:16.680
with this thing I'm lying to you so I'm lying to somebody no matter what you're making people lie by doing this

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:24.119
how stupid is that it's just it's so crazy it's like I can't take it seriously anymore I can't it's almost

01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:31.500
like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] seriously anymore it's almost like mind control isn't it I mean you see it they talk down on people like

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:37.260
people like myself who I do this completely on my own I'm not working for

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:42.359
University I'm not a per I don't have a I'm not a scholar I'm just a guy with the channel that wants to learn and

01:02:42.359 --> 01:02:48.780
wants to make content but when I come to some of these people with their masters of divinities and I talk to them and I

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:55.440
bring stuff up like hey why does Herodotus never mention any of this like I'll just say stuff like how come these

01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:01.500
elephantine Jews living in the fifth century don't have any book of Exodus they don't have a book of Genesis they

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:07.500
don't have any of the prophets they have a temple of Yahweh but they also have other like what's going on like why is

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:13.260
there nothing no evidence at all of any of these texts until the fourth and

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:19.980
third century and they they just write me off like I'm like like I'm being like like I'm a mythicist or some crazy

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:26.160
person they just write you off completely like you like what you're saying is so it's

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:31.619
so beneath me that I don't even have to respond to you that's that's how that's that's the type of mentality that I that

01:03:31.619 --> 01:03:39.119
I get when I when I bring these bring this stuff to their to their attention it just seems like what I'm saying is so

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:46.500
it's so uh look at look at me I have a PhD in the in the Dead Sea Scrolls so

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:51.900
that means I went to school for 10 years and you you're bringing yourself to my attention that I've never heard before

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:57.180
so therefore it must not be true that's what it feels like

01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:03.240
it feels like you think because you went to school for 10 years that you know everything now

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:10.619
and it's like that's not what I'm seeing I'm not impressed to be honest I'm just not I would I would correct you in one way

01:04:10.619 --> 01:04:17.760
Neil I would correct you in one way you said I'm not a scholar that's not true that's not true you're

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:23.880
better scholar than people I worked with okay so that's that's absolutely not

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:31.799
true you're a scholar of this public Museum and people come to you to get that information so you know you may not

01:04:31.799 --> 01:04:37.260
be ha sharing in the glory of the boys at Princeton and Harvard but yes we can

01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:42.660
smack but you're a scholar but you're a

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:49.140
scholar don't ever say you're not a scholar but no that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] those degrees that those people

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:54.359
have are worthless they they think they can hold them over your head you show

01:04:54.359 --> 01:04:59.760
them the evidence and they run away they run away like cowards

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:04.799
sir smug you're a coward I asked I asked for a citation of Genesis

01:05:04.799 --> 01:05:11.160
just somebody one one person mentioning the Book of Genesis and the ancient world let's say before

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:19.680
all right let's before 400. let's see that should be pretty easy I get shown a Hebrew word two Hebrew

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:27.240
words side by side in the book of Jeremiah now yes it's true that in the Book of

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:33.480
Genesis those two Hebrew words show up side by side how is that a citation

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:40.260
you found a genetic connection between two texts maybe how is that a citation though

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:47.960
right that's what I asked for that's what I got so if that's the best you can give me when I ask for a citation of the

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:53.579
most Masterpiece book of all time the book that started three major religions

01:05:53.579 --> 01:05:59.059
that conquered the world and I'm at and now all I'm asking for is somebody

01:05:59.059 --> 01:06:07.380
somewhere that mentions this text before 400 BC and the best you can do is show

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:13.079
me some language in another book that doesn't even say like a citation to me

01:06:13.079 --> 01:06:21.240
is when Plato says in Homer's Odyssey book 10 Odysseus does this that's a citation but

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:28.140
when when something happens in one book and they mention a word they use the word chaos and then in another book

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:34.500
someone else uses the word chaos that's not a citation the citation would be oh

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:39.660
in the in the book written by Moses called Genesis here's what it says blah

01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:46.319
blah blah that's a citation and I that's what I said to this person I said that's not a

01:06:46.319 --> 01:06:53.339
citation and they're like they they put they wrote me off like I was some crazy person because I didn't accept this this

01:06:53.339 --> 01:06:59.579
idea of a citation so I'm just saying that that's the best if that's the first thing you're throwing at me then I

01:06:59.579 --> 01:07:06.599
already know that what I'm what that where I'm going is in the right direction do you feel Neil you don't have to name

01:07:06.599 --> 01:07:13.859
names I'm not gonna but do you feel that in all of your interactions with

01:07:13.859 --> 01:07:22.140
Scholars over the years do you feel that you may have been intellectually molested a little bit

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:27.359
oh yeah especially especially winners at the church glad I broke out of that pretty

01:07:27.359 --> 01:07:33.299
quick though I'm sorry even after though even after like coming out of that and I start you

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:38.700
know start following different with different academics yeah of course that's that's the case sometimes you

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:43.859
know yeah yeah it's just a shame that people won't that people won't kind of

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:50.520
say hey damn the fame damn the career damn the money

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:57.599
we're just bringing the museum and that's what you're doing that's what you're doing well I hope I hope your art

01:07:57.599 --> 01:08:03.780
by the way for all my audience I hope Neil's art continues to take off because

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:10.920
he's gonna be the next get this I hope you don't mind if I tell them but um they know that you work with me you

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:17.278
produce um some of the video right that I'm bringing out and

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:24.120
um your style and your you know your certain Flair that you've got um and I want to thank you for doing

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:30.960
that I want them to recognize that as well but um I have presented Neil with

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:37.380
one of the most difficult projects I think you could have and that is I asked him to present

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:44.699
the image of Lady Babylon the Medea producing the

01:08:44.699 --> 01:08:52.440
communion from her vagina just as the texts talk about and I'm

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:57.660
hoping that he can do this but he has to go up against an AI you have to battle

01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:04.500
an AI right things very regulated on what you try to produce which is which you can understand that

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:10.380
because there's people who try to make you know pedophilia [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on so you can see why it's like that so I don't

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:15.798
know what it's going to let me do I don't know how far let me go but we're definitely gonna try it

01:09:15.799 --> 01:09:21.120
logically people remember I'm I'm gonna be reading a text this is a preview I'm

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:28.080
going to be reading a text um so the whole YouTube Community can know how on the up and up this is I'm

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:33.298
going to be reading a text of a Roman Gaius Valerius flaccus where he

01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:41.880
describes Medea taking the drug from her vagina that is used to anoint Jason so

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:47.460
that he can be both flame retardant and without any pain

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:54.540
you know stimulated for combat love it love it so I'm hoping that Neil can

01:09:54.540 --> 01:10:01.080
bring this image of Lady Babylon through um I love it Neil I I can't thank you

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:06.079
enough for working with me my pleasure

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:15.678
