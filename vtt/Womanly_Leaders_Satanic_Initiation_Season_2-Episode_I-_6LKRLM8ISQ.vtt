00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.180
ran up without me oh

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.160
welcome to season two of Lady babylon's

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.399
satanic initiation tonight we will get a glimpse into the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.920
personal we're going to look at a woman learning

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.940
the history of women

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.450
[Music]

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.900
foreign

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.640
we don't have much time so I'll make it brief tonight I want you to know that I had a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.840
request sent to me this week one of many student requests

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.080
um of a person looking for someone to guide the research of a sophomore in

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.479
high school on a paper on the history of women in antiquity

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.600
in Antiquity she sent the request to me specifically and not to other

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.399
instructors on uh the place that I teach um I wrote her back swiftly and with

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.920
determination because I was asked as a graduate student to come into the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.420
women's Studies classes and to teach some women's studies from the sources

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:14.520
that I work with the medical sources pharmacological the magic to bring those sources forward to show

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:23.280
people um so this is great opportunity for me to teach to advance who else would not

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.599
want to learn in the email that I sent her back I made it very clear that what

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:37.220
she needed and that what I could provide see if I was a good fit or not was the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.739
sources that that Harbor

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.680
these images of the ancient woman and who she is the sources themselves we

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.980
don't want that lattice that's built up on scholarship scholarship great scholarship modern

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.040
scholarship on women we'll look at modern scholarship on women by

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.080
talking about quoting Mary beard who many of you have probably heard of

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.040
um she's associated with the classics department or she was at

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.239
one time I don't know if she still is Cambridge so a scholar of Scholars

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:31.640
um so before we quote Marion bring her into this brawl

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.500
my object is to teach you the sources if you're my student

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.659
to give you the sources that you can work with them via the instrument that I

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:50.879
use namely the ancient Greek this is standard Classics protocol for

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:58.799
this is what we do we translate anyway um Mary beard married beard how can she

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.959
help me now to be able to give these the next

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:12.959
generation of women the history of women sadly the responsibility can fall short

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.840
of the Deliverance if we turn aside from the primary

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.000
sources people want to give you theories and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.620
this is where our Public Safety announcement comes in today people will want to give you theories and theories

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.180
are a whole there's a market of them and they drive an economy of

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.060
Scholars academicians you will always have them with you

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.460
whatever Society you're in these people will exist

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.180
and their system is driven by their ideas their system is driven by their their

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:05.639
ideas the problem is we come to the museum where we hold sacred The Muse

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.060
we do not hold forward ideas or theories

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:18.960
we look at the words we look at the last material Expressions

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.259
that we have surviving from these cultures that's what we look at

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.840
I don't want you to have to go to a back alley with a stranger

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.800
I don't want you to tonight's question is who who is the one who is to be

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.320
believed is it the bald guy with the tattoos

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:50.220
or is it the Cambridge professor who is also

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:58.500
of high-ranking uh uh of value within British aristocratic Society

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:08.100
yes who's more believable than that yes yes the Dame or the dude with the

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.100
shaved head so you can be deceived you can think that you're getting a source that's a

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:22.560
legitimate source and that's that person can tell you anything then if you've fallen into the

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.699
trust oh it's okay I trust you what we do here is we insist upon our

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:36.300
sources we insist upon our sources don't tell me what your ideas are tell me what the sources say

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.300
can we bring up the quotes from Mary beard

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:49.199
yes there is at First Sight it's a rather impressive array of powerful female characters in The repertoire of

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:55.680
Greek myth and Greek word telling in life ancient women had no formal

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.220
political rights they had precious little economic or social Independence and in some cities

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.919
like Athens respectable married women were almost never seen

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:13.199
outside the home anytime that you have a generalization I

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:18.240
mean how do you how do you judge whether any of this is is accurate anytime you

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.360
have a generalization about Antiquity you you're talking about two millennia's

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.560
time and you're talking about dozens and dozens of independent cultures

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.780
oh my goodness to say that to give a generalization it doesn't matter what

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.819
it's about now this happens to you all the time if you're in church it happens

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:47.819
to you in church because remember it's this is how it starts this is how you end up in the back alley okay so I'm

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:54.300
telling you these are the lines that start the process in biblical times

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.520
everybody sat on their hands all lunch

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.039
and whistle Dixie yes you might believe that from an

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:10.699
authority you might believe that but if you hear the generalization realize

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:18.960
generalizations never hold up in history they never hold up you can talk about Cycles you can talk about repetition you

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:26.580
can talk about Trends uh uh um but you cannot hold a generality of any time a

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.520
scholar comes to you and says all blanks did this you know that they have an

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:39.719
agenda to to push something's being pushed when I taught the section of the women's

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:45.060
studies course that I taught I brought all the concrete in I want you to see

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:52.459
these women these are the women I want you to see from Antiquity give give us the list of women please

00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:58.200
yes starting with women yes who else do we bring you

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:04.140
you need to see midwives you need to see the teachers

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.839
you need to see doctors you need to see priestesses

00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:16.620
you need to see Queens mean ads let's throw them in too why not

The Witches let's not forget the witches because everything is coming from the witches it's all coming back from the

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:35.519
witches are lying through the cave here is the pharmacology it's the pharmacology bring up the second quote

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:40.459
of Mary beard please hmm

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:49.680
yes Athenian drama and the Greek imagination has offered our mate imaginations a whole series of

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.320
Unforgettable women names like Medea Clyde nestra or Antigone among many

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:02.880
others can still ring a loud Bell for us they are not however role models for

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.000
anybody far from it please pull up now again you're sitting

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.880
there you're sitting there and you're saying these are the words of wisdom from Cambridge

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:21.480
from the eye of this stuff that breeds all of those such intelligent creatures

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:28.920
comes this voice this miraculous voice of Mary beard and Mary beard tells us

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.320
something about women and now I don't know whether to believe it

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.480
now I don't know are these people not to be were they intentionally written is

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:45.000
not to be admired that's what she's saying it's odd and okay let's just get

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.420
in our spaceship and let's go back in time let's go to Italy let's go to the

00:10:51.420 --> 00:11:00.660
Marcy the culture uh um uh that develops near uh um the Temple

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:06.540

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:13.740
um and who is who who's on get you she's the one who brings the healing to us she is the one who brings the healing she is

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:19.320
the one who hears us of the snake bites she is the one who knows all of the

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:25.320
pharmacology who is this person that showed up um in Italy and gets worshiped as a

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:31.500
woman forget about Pro what what did you say property or political rights when people

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:37.579
are building temples to you this is a kind of power that has nothing to do

00:11:37.579 --> 00:11:44.279
with your estimation your modern anachronistic estimation of feminine

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:50.820
power yeah yeah feminine power that's on githia and who do our sources tell us

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:57.240
that angitya is you know it it's Medea says her son ruled there

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.959
he rolled there yes she visited

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:09.600
coming from her uh uh uh Union with the another with the Greek Prince

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:16.820
yes they set up Society they set up Authority yes and she's this is before

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:25.680
an entire group an ethnic group living around the Black Sea decided to

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:32.640
call itself after its Queen the 13 year old scythian Queen

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.339
in full armor is a beautiful they just they just dug

00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:43.860
up is a beautiful beautiful refutation of

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:51.420
everything that Mary beard said yes beautiful refutation

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:57.240
the chief the most powerful the greatest

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.940
yes full armor arrows probably poison

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:08.160
nice and where are they perfecting all these poisons in Syria

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.820
right with the with the mobile tribes of Horsemen yeah and their Royal lines

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:21.720
yes fantastic Greek influence African influence gorgeous it's Adam

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.839
it's Eden nice um let's uh go ahead put flash Mary Beard's picture up there because we

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:35.880
don't we wanted to give her credit right that's married beard uh you can find her work on online yes now whether or not

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.040
the person is going to um let's leave and get the other whether or not

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.980
the person is going to allow me to teach a history of women based upon the

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:52.560
Physicians and The Midwives and there is a difference the iatrina is the female

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.019
and it may actually be the oldest word for doctor okay so is it probably coming

00:13:58.019 --> 00:14:03.680
from the Midwifery yeah right and we know that all the oldest drugs are old

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:10.440
abortion drugs uh what are we gonna do about this abortion business right if you're going

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:15.740
to talk about women you better talk about abortion it's a huge issue

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:22.740
maybe more so than you think because one out of three women dies in childbirth

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:28.980
yeah so Family Planning is serious it's life and death

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:36.480
yeah so um whether or not we're going to get these images brought to you will be determined by whoever wants to know

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:43.500
the sources or the modern lattice of scholarship the

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:49.139
clouds over those sources right this puts an interpretation on

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:54.839
something that gives it a an agenda a movement this is meant to cause this and

00:14:54.839 --> 00:15:01.320
people these guys that will come behind that will get you and take you behind the building

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:07.440
they are from Princeton and they are from Harvard they're from Oxford they're

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:13.860
from Cambridge wow how did this happen though you know what's funny

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:19.199
um Princeton's program is imploding right they just they announced it well

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:25.920
it was six months ago maybe that they're cutting their Greek program because reads the language of the

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:31.800
oppressor yeah that's what they came up with you

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:38.279
know it's their ideas and they're throwing them around in a hundred years from non-movie will care

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:44.220
but we may have forgotten the text by then and we may not have people trained

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:51.120
to bring that out of the ground yeah to bring it to you so you know

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:59.100
you're not being taken behind the building if I'm giving you or anybody is giving you

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:04.920
the actual sources if you are working with the evidence

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:12.180
at the crime scene that's what that's what matters and otherwise you should say I don't care and here's that I don't

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:17.820
care moment thanks to Zane Campbell can We cue that I don't care moment I don't

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:23.120
care about nothing I'm going to do what I was gonna do anyway

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:30.839
I don't care about another Halloween

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:41.940
[Music] that is the scars uh true truest emotion

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:50.279
right we should care nothing those of us here should care nothing about anything but the Integrity of those voices of

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:56.459
antiquity that's what we should care about um I would love it if Mary beard would

00:16:56.459 --> 00:17:03.180
start reading some of the pharmacological sources some of the medical sources some of the focusing

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:09.780
maybe on some of the religious cult sources and some of the magic maybe

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:15.540
um there's a whole area of hymns you know those homeric hymns those homeric

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:22.980
hymns Mary they're about a lot of women so we might want to consider that in the

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:30.299
Athens the place that you so brilliantly told us was so repressive that you can

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:35.820
walk to the hot top of the hill Mary you can look into the temple and you can see

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:41.760
the virgin you can see the Virgin Mary that's what that's what we need to bring

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:47.700
is the Virgin bring back the Virgin yes if you want to study ancient women study

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:55.860
the Virgin you'll be fascinated what are all these priestesses doing oh my goodness what are these oracles Mary the

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:01.799
oracles what are the oracles doing Mary those Oracles of women you know that

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:07.020
Mary you know that what are they doing they're Distributing

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:12.140
the power of antiquity yeah Distributing the power of antiquity

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:20.820
Medea whom Mary beard has decided is not worth emulation in Antiquity her word

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:26.400
was Oracle pindar perhaps the greatest poet

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:32.400
that the Greeks ever produced pindar preserves her

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.559
Oracle taken directly from the hands of the

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:43.100
pythia herself yes these are not people to emulate

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:50.880
these are not no no um in Antiquity they were they were the

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:57.600
um I want you to to make sure that your your Bible times are in the right place

the one who administers the one who administers the ion

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:49.919
isn't that nice the administer of the ion yes he pounds at the gates the dark

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:57.019
gates of the firstborn chaos

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:07.980
readying or engaging himself in his bring up the text again EO darkens

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:13.080
yes eodokin and for those of you who were here last week you'll see EO on the

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:19.559
front of yodelkin is from EOS let's bring up yodoke please

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:26.280
um yep there we go oh nice holding arrows usually to describe the

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:32.340
forrete right you know you're we're talking about Quivers here right

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:40.980
something that holds arrows um look at the second definition though of that uh uh in that you yeah there we

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:47.820
go containing poison here is in the feminine is that was just

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:54.240
containing poison like the fangs right or Dantes the teeth

00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:00.600
right there's so it's an instrument those arrows are an instrument Eros

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:08.039
think not not pudgy baby right think of Eros the primal

00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:13.980
right the one who brings everything with dark knight into existence that's the

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:19.020
figure we're looking at he has his arrows his quiver

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:24.960
full of his arrows that do what they bring the godhead okay that's important

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:31.440
it's giving them a label it does this with the drugs the Greek does this with the drugs as well we saw the death

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.780
bringing drugs right the early death bringing drugs

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:43.559
um here it's the same thing his his arrows are labeled as the ones that bring you the divine

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:51.539
the ones that bring you the divine yes and he's he he's got these um that

00:21:51.539 --> 00:21:57.600
he keeps and on them are written in Gold letters written in Gold letters

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.720
um these oystery bring us up the oyster what are oystery an arrow look what the

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:11.179
derivation uncertain now for those of you who have been here a while you know that oistress

00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:17.220
boisterous is just lacking that road there I told you about the row that

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:23.039
disappears like the diagama yes so there's again an association you know

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:29.460
we're building on a people and a culture and that culture was poison using Arrow wielding peoples

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:37.679
um with Queens with Queens yes um and anyway Eros goes on

00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:47.520
um with these arrows describing a list of the 12 Stars those 12 burning arrows

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:53.940
12 but we're in we're in Magic now in case you realize we've crossed over uh-oh

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:59.580
um we got to recognize what's going on here where are we necromancers

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:04.760
um so you've got the 12 arrows and he starts out of course with IO

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:11.520
IO rise IO um and we moved from Iowa to Europa

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.799
yeah and then you realize oh wait a minute he's composing a list of these

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:25.500
women just like Herodotus did wait a minute wait a minute what Herodotus made a list of women

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:30.659
who were being abducted they were being taken away from their

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:37.020
homes and established elsewhere as oracles

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:45.659
yeah as IO is literally in the oysters right that's who she is so

00:23:45.659 --> 00:23:51.720
um by the time that we have this list and it it begins it begins with IO and

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:58.320
Europa and by the way Medea is one of those mentioned in Herodotus right he's

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:06.000
one of he um she's one of those yeah right up front and these are causing Wars and whatnot so

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.940
um this situations are causing War these apparently these women are so important

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:17.039
not to be emulated Mary beard says but apparently in Antiquity they're so

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:22.440
important that people are starting Wars over what they can do

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:29.520
over their capacity um fantastic maybe it's worth taking off

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:35.520
your lens and looking at it from their point of view instead of yours from the

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:41.400
last two thousand years forward right yeah so here they are here they

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:49.860
are and um the last of the women on these lists this list is olympius

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:56.820
right olympius who's olympius the mother of Alexander right who under the

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:02.299
possession of the burning purple

00:25:02.299 --> 00:25:08.880
communes with Zeus himself in the form of Amon

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:17.520
as a serpent right so um what do we have going on you have two

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:23.580
very conflicting images of antiquity one of them is real

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.740
just based in sources just read the sources to yourself don't everything

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:37.080
that I told you tonight was just directly stolen wholeheartedly from the sources read those sources if you read

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:42.720
the modern you're going to get a version that might not stand up to what the

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:48.779
sources say and to be honest modern Scholars are so let down women's studies

00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:56.880
they have completely dropped the ball completely if you knew

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:02.640
half of what was being investigated by just

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:08.340
the witches pharmacologists sorceresses Magi

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:15.720
Cults all the orphics if you knew just a half of what they were working with what

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:22.020
they were experimenting with you would be you would be shocked and you'd understand what the mystery was all

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:29.880
about you'd understand oh this is the performance of the mystery this is the performance of the mystery yes so

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:35.760
um my question to you tonight that I want to leave you with

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.120
because we're approaching touchdown is

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:47.760
what reality are you following yeah whose reality is it

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:54.480
if it has anything to do with any dead people you're going to get lured into a

00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:01.980
corner controlling the information that you are given about your reality

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:07.740
has been happening as long as we have recorded written history

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:14.760
it's been happening that's why we follow Pythagoras we form

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:20.340
that museum if we're going to set down a colony if we're going to raise a colony

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:28.919
if we're going to bring civilization we have to raise that Temple to the muse

00:27:28.919 --> 00:27:36.299
without that Temple of the Muse we have nothing and right here right now we have access to everything these documents are

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:43.679
all there we have access to them Cambridge Oxford they don't have it wrapped up in a cabinet they don't

00:27:43.679 --> 00:27:50.220
no we have access to it now so I would love an army I would love an

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:56.159
army of women to start writing women's history

00:27:56.159 --> 00:28:01.500
I would love it I would love it and that way you don't have to have me

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:08.279
teach your daughter you can teach her yourself confidently knowing it's from The Source

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:15.260
but but um and I think this is why a lot of times that what I uh

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:20.820
at the conference that I was at presenting they said this work that I

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:25.980
was doing was the Last Frontier of classics yeah it's not just that it's the Last

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:33.120
Frontier it's that it's what we have entirely missed that has skewed our

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:40.740
understanding of History so I would encourage you tonight uh I would encourage you tonight to realize that

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:45.779
what you may be perceiving may be a a

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:51.900
a mechanism of control a mechanism of control right go back to

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:57.960
the Muse go to your sources work with the sources and if you want

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:04.200
if you want the to get down to the very dirt go to the instrument itself do not

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:10.500
trust somebody because they have a name or a reputation or a badge

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:16.380
from an association right trust them if they're dead

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:22.080
trust them if they're dead yes if you drag up an ancient Ramen

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:28.340
bring them in if you pull up somebody from I mean the the mind can you imagine

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:33.419
the a frontery the Bold brashness

00:29:33.419 --> 00:29:39.120
of saying that this woman who was hailed as an oracle

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:48.500
who has had temples built to her who raised and lowered entire kingdoms

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:55.679
wow to say that to present you with an image of the world I think it's I think

00:29:55.679 --> 00:30:03.000
it's really why Jehovah lies in the very beginning remember Joe ver Jehovah he

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.940
tells him right off the bat this is no good if they eat it they're gonna have their eyes open and they're gonna be

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:14.279
like us knowing Good and Evil yeah they shouldn't be like that right

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:19.380
no right tell them it's gonna kill him the devil says it's not going to kill

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:25.140
you you're just gonna have your eyes open and then what does the text say they had their eyes open

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:30.600
it follows along the text follows along with the with the proposition that the

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:36.659
LIE is coming from Jehovah trying to stop them right just no good no good

00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:42.480
he's been a liar from the beginning from the very beginning

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.880
and I think that's what I think that's what the problem is when you fight for

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:54.360
Jehovah when you fight for that thing that you they've identified as modern Scholars

00:30:54.360 --> 00:31:02.039
have identified as such a terrible patriarchal source um yeah uh you're going to come up

00:31:02.039 --> 00:31:08.760
against that lie yeah the fruit was good guess what she

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:16.380
ate it and she was smart and she did a lot of good things and we made statues to her

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:22.559
and no we aren't misogynists yes we are

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:30.480
worshipers of the virgin yeah Magna mats here you know there's a

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:37.200
connection I'll finish with this angizia there that I showed you

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:44.279
and her Worship in Italy yes yes that's connected with bone DEA

00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:51.360
and all of a sudden when he said born a day you say oh my God that's Central Roman religion right and the rights of

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:59.159
bonadea with um what are they doing with the wand the alabaster that they're using in their women's only rights yes

00:31:59.159 --> 00:32:04.500
yes medical medical think medical religious

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:10.020
yes these are the things this is the this is the environment that we need to

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:17.039
come to now in order to see uh um the reality we get back on our ship and we

00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:24.480
come back home and now if you want to believe what married beard has given you at

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.700
least you have some ancient sources to contradict what the modern Scholars are

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:37.320
saying right never trust the secondary work never it's just somebody's opinion

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:42.360
it's just somebody's opinion trust the primaries rule with the primaries

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:48.840
promote the primaries and I guess now I I see that Rob has come Rob please tell

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:54.960
us from the great Island upon which you sit uh your impression of

00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:02.659
you know the dangers is this a good time to have a public safety announcement about the dangers of these

00:33:02.659 --> 00:33:08.520
oxfordians and andringians of coming into our society

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:16.320
and taking out our children taking them into back alleys and doing things to them that are unacceptable what is with

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:22.860
the island now is this is this me is or is my indignation righteous oh you're

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:29.760
gonna love it you get season two and you can't do without me can you um is that the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that a new

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:36.120

00:33:42.539 --> 00:33:50.640
there a problem with my shirt Rob this shirt is important the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh look so we're talking about a

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:57.659
local girl she's from Shrewsbury is Mary and I'm willing to bet it's bad

00:33:57.659 --> 00:34:04.080
I do I do like beard but I'm willing to bet it's very bad

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:09.419
yeah yeah she's a local girl and um my phone would collapse on me at the

00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:15.658
minute watch it right time once it's but um do you think she might be an oracle

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:23.580
by any chance um yeah and Excuse Me Miss Baird however

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:29.398
you pronounce it um uh um excuse me if I've mispronounced

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:37.320
your name but um do I think that she's an oracle yeah what are you smoking because you were

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:42.658
you here for the last 20 minutes Usher come get this man

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:48.658
do you know what she's wrote in 1989 she wrote the good working

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:55.320
mother's guide did Mary bad that's it like so isn't Oracle a good

00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:03.900
working mother would you think um yeah no I'm sorry I'm sorry but the

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:10.380
whole day no the whole insult to Medea she could have written I could have written every

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:16.099
everything in the world um if uh for that premise to be so off

00:35:16.099 --> 00:35:22.140
uh about women in Antiquity it takes it's like uh I can't

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:29.640
um you know John Scarborough John Scarborough the well-known John Scarborough told me he said don't don't

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:36.900
you you that secondary literature is gonna mess with your mind it's gonna mess with your mind I want the sources I

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:43.500
want the sources married beard is another is another secondary source and

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:49.859
it no I can't Oracle now my mind is blowing let me take you to another book

00:35:49.859 --> 00:35:56.359
that was I mean that's 1989. so we've got we've got another book which is um

00:35:56.359 --> 00:36:01.980
Pagan priest religion and Power in the ancient world

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:07.980
now What's missing what's missing from that title Pagan

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:15.140
priests religion empowering the ancient world I suppose women is missing

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:22.800
maybe maybe there's some women there so yeah you're quite correct she uh and she

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:28.859
she because I knew she was coming up so I took the liberty of watching watching

00:36:28.859 --> 00:36:34.500
a documentary on Caligula you know so uh what what took from that

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:41.220
is she knows about poisons she she mentions as Emperors bumped off with poison mushrooms and which I was

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:47.160
surprised if she mentioned the mushrooms actually but she so uh all the people dropping

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:54.240
Dead with poison it seems I want I wonder where the poisons made I wonder if she's considered where's that poison

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:59.280
made where's it coming from uh where where's the root of that poison coming

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.200
through because do you think she might no

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:15.920
that's where she gets that reference yeah right and he knows he he'll talk about poison that but she doesn't know

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:21.839
the medical sources she doesn't know I guarantee she doesn't know that I

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:30.180
scoredy she doesn't know scribonius largest right she may have heard diascortis but she doesn't read scribonius largas right and so how can

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:37.320
we talk about cult drugs if she doesn't read the people that were talking about Colt drugs this is this is a fact modern

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:44.280
day classicists do not study the medical side because it demands too much

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:51.240
crossover so it's their loss it's their loss Tom Jefferson I didn't care

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:56.579
sorry where'd you suppose she's getting that information from for the distinction as the poisons coming from

00:37:56.579 --> 00:38:03.300
mushrooms rather than any other shows because she's got that distinction there with the mushrooms yeah that's that's

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:08.400
quite that's quite interesting and also I was interested in the time the

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:14.760
challenge the historical resources tell us because because this was written hundreds of years after apparently and

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:21.060
said that this this story is of of Caligula is

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:26.339
written hundred years after by the by the show shouldn't it and

00:38:26.339 --> 00:38:31.560
I'm wondering about the time frame have we got Saint John drinking poison at the

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:38.160
same time you know John Saint John I don't know of

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:43.740
a source that talks about Saint John drinking poison but it doesn't mean it's not often it

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:48.900
was offered poisoning in a Charlie Swansea and there's there's images of him out there and he's holding the

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:55.320
Chalice with a snake in a cup and a chalice and and as the story goes as he

00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:01.859
drinks the whole the whole measure and it doesn't affect him in the slightest is this is this

00:39:01.859 --> 00:39:09.180
later medieval is it Byzantine do you remember what this is I I never heard that one yeah but there's a lot of the a

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:14.220
lot of the Gnostic and a lot of the Coptic stuff out there the gospels that

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:20.940
that yeah when you go through images and you get drawn up on images you'll you'll find

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:26.579
one with it and like it just adds to the stakes everywhere snakes everywhere you

00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:34.320
go into researches snakes shippings everywhere lifted lifted really scented all around so she knows she know she

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:40.140
knows she knows about the poisons in my opinion just Mary bad

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:45.300
so do you want to listen to your honors list I mean this honors list is you you

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:51.480
talk you talk about credentials and have you got any credentials and you know what I'm like I go through these

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:58.440
credentials and I noticed this princess of asterious award

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:04.500
she's won a princess of asterious award and I just got you know I'm looking out

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:11.160
for the St segmental route I am and do you do you get any shorter impression

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:16.820
from that that that Prince ever princess of asterious award

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:22.800
no that doesn't do that doesn't again Rob it doesn't do anything for me once

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:29.339
you've shown me yeah that she can read saturnius that's great once you've shown me that you're gonna talk about an area

00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:36.599
that you know nothing about right that you're not bringing the medicine into that you're not talking about women who

00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:44.160
are in these positions and then you have the effrontery to bring up Medea and say that she is represented as somebody that

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:49.980
you would not you would not want to be I I I cannot I don't care if she's from

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:58.380
the Royal Society of the Throne of Satan I don't care if she's got burning purple on her coat of arms anymore we've now

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:05.760
violated The Muse right she's not going to those sources she's supposed to be a classicist she's

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.880
supposed to do this to make a statement like it flashed up there right that it

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:17.460
it's unforgivable it's in the in the world of the real it's unforgivable I

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:24.359
mean she'll go over the course and everything's fine and people will read it and they'll think yes and maybe some

00:41:24.359 --> 00:41:31.440
of them will think oh my God she's part of the society Society of Asteria and none of it will matter because we'll

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:39.060
miss the freaking sources Rob we'll miss the sources and that's that's uh that's

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:45.780
what needs to be pounded right why are we not doing this we have the opportunity to do that what other

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:51.060
accolades do we do you want to talk about I I have a suspicion though is

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:58.320
they don't you say they don't read the sources but they must be aware of the sources and ignore the sources and not

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:04.740
include the sources for it for a reason there's a reason there why like in in

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:10.260
Professor Rock's situation you know you pay a price for revealing

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:17.160
some of the sources at times don't you yeah you do and and uh there are things

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:23.280
that people don't want to talk about nobody wants to talk about magic right it's maybe in the last few years has

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.680
started to become more popular but um when I was doing my degree program the

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:36.359
uh you know there was one or two people in the country working on it in the U.S that's it I'm which is funny because

00:42:36.359 --> 00:42:42.660
because you have far more magic than you have just about every other genre so

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:51.720
yeah so why aren't people studying it well it's because we've lived through 2000 years of Christianity and

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:59.119
um uh it's anti-sorcerer anti-sateness uh uh you know

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:06.359
a power power and yet still 330 000 people getting abused right

00:43:06.359 --> 00:43:13.680
um we need the facts we need the facts I don't think she's I I don't think anything my difficulty is not with Mary

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:20.099
beard my difficulty is with separating our sacred our sacred duty to

00:43:20.099 --> 00:43:27.680
the sources and our desire to be looked upon and loved and cherished is a genius

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:33.599
and here's the documentary on blah you know I I did a documentary too that

00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:40.980
based on my book right and it's a it's a a a a sinkhole

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:47.819
it's a sinkhole of meism right it's a sinkhole of meism that

00:43:47.819 --> 00:43:54.960
documentary should be there not for the glory of the individual right or for the professorship or for the seated chair of

00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:01.200
so-and-so or the distinguished visiting scholar of so and so it should be access

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:08.760
in the museum it should be what you see when you walk up in the museum you see access to the sources right away that's

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:14.819
what we're supposed to do with Classics that's what Tom Jefferson did right and that's not what has come out

00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:20.640
of Classics if there's a um if we're fighting tyrants it's probably a good reason that

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:28.440
there's probably a correlation with Princeton just decapitating its own Greek program right yeah guess what that's that's what

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:34.920
happens when you let that information go um yeah I know it was I know it will

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:40.500
sound like I'm being I'm awfully hard awfully hard do I sound hard to you

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:47.400
right and I'm coming from mcardally sarcastic point of view it's it's like dark sarcasm because

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:53.000
because there's a where's that one gone confronting the classics

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.260
confronting the classics Traditions adventures and Innovations you know is

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:05.339
she confronting the classics I don't think there's any confrontation in that is he personally and what you need to do

00:45:05.339 --> 00:45:11.040
is confront the classics with this information that you have and that

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:17.099
Professor Rook has given us amongst others who would wouldn't dare wouldn't dare

00:45:17.099 --> 00:45:23.220
step step foot into these Realms where it's basically you get you you get your

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:30.420
wrist slapped and step back don't you is that is that this situation I really want to know what the situation is the

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:38.280
situation in this academic Circle where where basic choices and sure she's what

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:43.319
are easily accessible and now now in our day and age Now sources are accessible

00:45:43.319 --> 00:45:49.020
aren't they you didn't you used to have to go to the library you used to have to go get order books you need to take a

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:55.880
good while to do a good amount of research nowadays you can get that done on you

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:05.460
academic circles why is it the case that this is taboo and we can not talk about

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:10.680
it or discuss it not even raise it to up for discussion

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:17.099
just even by like intellectual people will not allow this to be subject of

00:46:17.099 --> 00:46:24.300
drugs then they've tried that you've changed the words don't you he'll change the word to end theogen and we'll change the

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:32.760
words and make it a little bit more acceptable to discuss and that's done done that that's done

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:38.040
wonders answers for the discussion changing the word other than drugs because as soon as somebody mentions

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:43.260
drugs it's like ah Nobody Does Drugs don't don't do drugs drugs are bad it's

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:48.780
like here Nancy Reagan period ended

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:54.599
yeah I think it's I think it's the um the built-in anti-drug culture that

00:46:54.599 --> 00:47:01.980
we've got but I think it's also the fault of the it's partially the fault of the academicians that they don't study

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:08.280
certain Fields um because their job is to carve out something that they can stand on the top

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:14.760
of the hill I was there right I lived with them I ate with them I worked with them your job is to find some Hill

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:20.940
somewhere where you can distinguish yourself and anybody else who comes up the side of that Hill you knock them

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:27.780
down right these are my ideas this is my that's no that's not what you need and

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:33.540
you don't need that from me or call rock or anyone else you need the sources and

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:40.440
now you have access to them if you want to look up these drugs you have diastority sitting there go look up the

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:45.780
drugs go look up what the women are recommending you do with the drugs go

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:51.960
look up uh any any cases of abortion what happens look up the gynecologist

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:59.280
find them you can find them they're out there right not not all of it's been translated yet not all of it's been

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:04.440
translated and that's the only that's the only reason I say you've got to go to the instrument you've got to have

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:10.260
that instrument you've got to have that ability to pick up the New Testament and

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:16.079
read it it's the same for the seminarians if you can't read that thing you don't know what those word means if

00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:22.740
you're just going off an Interlinear this is how they do seminaries they give you the Greek on one line in English

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:28.200
English right above it boom well what are you doing then you're not really

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:35.280
doing anything you are memorizing a preset definition let me give you the

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:41.880
example logos I hope this will uh I hope this will reach people logos because

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:51.200
it's common everybody will translate this is word and everybody is wrong everybody is wrong

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:59.160
a seasoned classicist will tell you now logos doesn't mean

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:04.440
word that means an accounting or a reckoning

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:10.859
and this word flows through philosophy through pre-socratic philosophy it flows

00:49:10.859 --> 00:49:17.099
into an area of specialty yeah where when somebody comes up and

00:49:17.099 --> 00:49:25.319
says in the beginning was the logos you're not going to understand what it means if you think it means a word

00:49:25.319 --> 00:49:31.920
yeah you cannot read those texts so when you come along as a pastor or as

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:37.500
a classicist like Mary beard if you come along and you say oh I'm going to tell

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:44.280
you what this means and you use that Interlinear translation and it's not because you've been reading great if you

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:51.540
haven't read Plato as a pastor if if you haven't read Hippocrates don't tell me about Luke don't tell me a darn thing

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:57.680
about Luke if you haven't read Hippocrates you don't know what oh yeah you don't know

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.760
drugs drugs again right if you don't know those topics don't talk about the

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:08.880
frankincense don't talk about the Magi if you don't know who the Magi were if

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:16.079
you haven't read count if your pastor hasn't read Chaldean philosophy

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:22.260
Chaldean philosophy Chaldean incantations then forget about it you're not going to

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:27.599
understand the Magi you're not going to know what that star was and you can have all the crazy ideas in your head you

00:50:27.599 --> 00:50:32.760
want but don't blame those original sources

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:40.020
this is your fault you're the one who sat there in the audience and you listened to Mary right you didn't go back to the sources

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:45.780
stand up ask Mary give us the source and why is it why is

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:51.960
this Source talk about a woman as a physician why does it talk about a woman as a physician who's this I thought

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:57.839
women didn't have any power it didn't have any place didn't have any socioeconomic but why are Paul's

00:50:57.839 --> 00:51:04.920
supporters all women wealthy women wait a minute Mary I thought in the

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:09.960
great world of antiquity no no women had this ability

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:17.099
they were all oppressed do you hear what's happening this is how stuff like fascism comes to rise

00:51:17.099 --> 00:51:23.880
right once you control that information of History you control everything and

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:31.140
I'm not saying I'm not saying rob and I'll get off my Podium now but I'm not saying you need I'm not saying that you

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:37.859
uh uh you need to buy what I'm selling never would you don't need to buy me or

00:51:37.859 --> 00:51:44.880
Carl rock you don't need to you need the sources you need to look at them yourself and

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:52.079
figure out what they are you know figure out what those people were saying we just dug up that we just took up that 13

00:51:52.079 --> 00:52:00.480
year old Queen City and queen go to her as a source right that's a source here she is

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:06.180
preserved bones and armor yeah thought she was your boy didn't

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:13.740
they thought she was a man for years didn't they they genetically proved it was a girl yeah but for years they just

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:20.940
assumed didn't they I think they just assumed as it was a male you know oh from from the report yeah and then they

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:27.540
don't they were sanctioned for do the DNA analysis and that's come through which was quite a surprise to him

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:35.040
why do you think they assumed it was a male I don't know the the probably the size or the the because it's the armor the

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:43.079
the arrows the the you'd assume it's masculine trait weren't you the traditional Hunter I'm guessing and I

00:52:43.079 --> 00:52:48.599
think she's got one bone bone-headed arrow in the rest of the bronze bronze

00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:53.880
tipped very interesting very interesting I wish

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:59.579
there was a I wish there was a better means of getting to to that Source because you're like on

00:52:59.579 --> 00:53:07.380
Ancient Origins and different various websites that are just giving you like um a rundown there's nothing

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:15.420
I'd appreciate something like you can get into it into the details what what the analysis I've seen some things like

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:21.359
where they've shared and she had blue eyes and red hair and I'm thinking how do you know that how how did you figure

00:53:21.359 --> 00:53:27.680
that out I have no idea how they go about figuring something like that out

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:34.559
no idea but that's what they come out with

00:53:34.559 --> 00:53:41.520
so well we still don't know yet there's still a lot of nails a lot of analysis that can be done on them arrowheads on

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:47.760
the I mean you know you just won't get in there don't you so you can I can I have the test done on the arrowheads for

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:54.359
yeah for this chemical this compound this and see what we can get out of it because I do it once it wouldn't that be

00:53:54.359 --> 00:54:00.900
like the Sinker okay right with that we've got now that's apparently how

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:06.180
they've been you know how Rock was Vindicated was from those containers of

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:13.319
the uh of the communion of the cocaine right that yeah yeah fantastic you know

00:54:13.319 --> 00:54:19.140
I should get that Vindication and get that conclusive proofers yeah they were using

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:25.319
Arrow poisons I mean you've got it documented it's quite clear so it's quite clear it's quite clear from

00:54:25.319 --> 00:54:31.020
listening to that documentary from Mary bird that those marketplaces showing

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:38.660
poisons and Venoms and it's quite clear that is it's so accessible and people are using it left right and sent it then

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:44.940
it it isn't some black market thing is it you're going down the market and buying

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:51.900
these things and you're getting these things made by various ingredients

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:57.059
put together and that takes a skill that isn't a skill an emperor is it doesn't

00:54:57.059 --> 00:55:04.079
this feel anybody around him as that's a skill that's developed over time I guess shouldn't it yes and

00:55:04.079 --> 00:55:09.859
that's that's one of the groups that Mary missed she missed the root Cutters

00:55:09.859 --> 00:55:17.940
and those are women you know described as sorceresses right who are involved in

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:23.819
the drugs they're called polypharmicon right they've they're they have much drug knowledge those root Cutters are

00:55:23.819 --> 00:55:28.920
women euripides mother was a root cutter right what about her wait a minute I

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:37.319
thought euripides mother stayed in her house all the time right no she was a root cutter right

00:55:37.319 --> 00:55:45.240
well what's a root cutter and then all of a sudden you have a conversation for for uh sophomore in high school

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:52.559
right a a a a girl in high school she should hear this she should know what

00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:59.760
root Cutters are if she wants to know learn about ancient women or she can go to Mary and Mary can tell her ah don't

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:07.859
worry about that they all stayed in their homes and it feels so much better for us to righteously stand up and say

00:56:07.859 --> 00:56:16.200
oh look how bad these people were these oppressors to create this fairy tale but

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:22.319
the actual truth of the matter the reality is you're always more interesting I'd love to see a book

00:56:22.319 --> 00:56:29.040
written on the root Cutters I know Mary's not going to write a book on the root Cutters right but she's into drama

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:34.079
and we know that Sophocles has a play called the root Cutters so maybe she'll

00:56:34.079 --> 00:56:40.800
get on it I don't know probably not I'm being there I'm being I'm too busy writing books about how much of a

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:47.640
productive successful mother she has a carry into you know look at me

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:54.079
it's too much of that rather than look at where we've look at our Roots look at where we've come from and where we can

00:56:54.079 --> 00:57:00.660
ascribe power too about our importance in society you know it's like look at me

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:07.980
I can carry around a couple of children and do a degree you know how many honorary degree watch an honorary degree

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:15.540
yeah how many honorary degrees she's got from different universities it's scary what isn't on every degree

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:20.579
well he's just done nothing and they just give you the paperwork and so yeah

00:57:20.579 --> 00:57:26.099
you've got a degree in this University now because it's like loads of universities have given an honorary

00:57:26.099 --> 00:57:33.660
degree I wonder what the what do you think the cost of an honorary degree is who there's something transferring there

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:39.900
there's some kind of yeah you know how many do you possibly need because it's a list you know it's

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:47.160
just go on a Wikipedia it's a very simple might be a bunch of Lies pretty soon doubt it but it's a bunch of so

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:55.040
it's a big list she's a Dame as well so that's that

00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:00.119
that's pretty much that's an OB that's that's uh that's um order of the British

00:58:00.119 --> 00:58:05.400
Empire that's equivalent to being a knight that is that's a Knighthood gently

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:11.300
good I'm glad I'm glad I said something yeah yeah

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:17.400
and that's the best that the British have to offer the world is it not

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:22.440
the Knighthood yeah yeah I think there's one above that you know I don't know I

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:29.880
don't know that I don't know all the I I know which happens twice a year there's a list that's get that gets um

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:36.000
constructed twice a year in the undoubts the these obese and

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:44.220
honors to all sorts of people the world over yeah and um that's why we should believe

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:51.119
Mary and not the guy not the guy with the shaved head right within the satanic

00:58:51.119 --> 00:58:57.059
initiation don't right she has the accolades she has everything there I

00:58:57.059 --> 00:59:02.220
mean don't get me wrong I got accolades too bro but but they're but they're not

00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:08.119
they don't stand up to the official steel seal and with such

00:59:08.119 --> 00:59:14.460
misinformation with such um a rape of History because that's what

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:20.040
she's doing in those two comments that's what she's doing she's raping history

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:26.339
right she's creating something that's not she's forcing something on history that is not there

00:59:26.339 --> 00:59:31.920
um yeah it's them qualifications shouldn't carry that information should

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:37.079
it shouldn't carry that information in both streets and support it with oh and

00:59:37.079 --> 00:59:43.140
I'm this by the way you can't you don't contend what I'm saying because I'm a

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:49.440
Dame I've achieved these Awards and gone through these certain and it's just like

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:55.619
yeah why why can't we just look at the sources why can't you be just equal to

00:59:55.619 --> 01:00:00.720
the next person and then we can evaluate the sources as equals and get her own

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:06.619
Impressions from us and what that's what you're trying to facilitate doesn't it with

01:00:08.599 --> 01:00:16.319
tell the audience this Rob tell me if you think this is correct or way off it's not the people that have the

01:00:16.319 --> 01:00:23.220
accolades who carry the reality it's the people that they burn first and then set

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:28.859
up to set statues and monuments up to later right yep I think I think that's

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:35.099
very accurate yeah we'll end on we'll end on that high note

01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:41.220
