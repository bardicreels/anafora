00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.480
a visitation from Carl Jung and a guest appearance of the devil

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.620
will be kicking it up a notch on satanic initiation

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.289
[Music]

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.020
foreign delighted to be able to come to this

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.320
assembly again this Unholy assembly it does me great

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:36.180
great pride I am going to force upon you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.220
the soul of one Carl Jung and from Carl Jung we're going to make a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.659
deeper dive into the actual Magic that was guiding Carl Jung and his

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.720
mystery excuse me for one minute

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:21.830
[Music]

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.640
wow

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:42.599
without further ado Carl Jung please a patient in the world he was quiet but

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.060
completely dissociated schizophrenic and he was in the clinic

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.160
already for 20 years he had come into the clinic as a matter of fact being a

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.400
young man a little dark and and there's no particular education

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.739
and once I came to the war and and he was obviously excited and called to me

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.739
took me by the label of my coat and led me to the window I said now now you will

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:18.840
see now look at it look up at the Sun and see how it moves you see you must

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:27.540
move your hair too like this and then you will see the the follows of the Sun

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.220
and you know that's the origin of the Wind and you see how the sun moves As you

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.220
move your head from one side to the other now of course I didn't understand it at

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:51.739
all I thought there you are he's just crazy and but in that case remained in my mind

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.120
Carl please tell us the truth then where

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.959
this machination of this lunatic ended up taking you

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.680
and four years later I came across

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.979
a paper written by the German historian

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:26.340
who had dealt with her with the so-called mitrus literature a part of

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.820
the Great in Parisian social papayas and there

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.340
he produced the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.320
part of the so-called Metals laser literature namely

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.800
it is say there after the second prayer thou will see

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.300
how the disk of the sun unfolds and you will see

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.020
hanging down from it the tube the origin of the Wind

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.800
and when you move thy face the face to the regions of the East it will move

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.520
there and if you move your face to the region of the West it will follow you

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.600
and just like that Carl you was sucked into saturnian vision

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.860
and where did he end up an incident I know and you now this is

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.020
it this is the vision of my patient but how could you be sure that your

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.020
patient wasn't unconsciously recalling something that somebody had told you oh no quite out of question because that

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.600
thing was not known it was in a you know in a magic papayas in Paris in the uh

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.699
and it wasn't even published it was only published four years later after I had

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:01.139
observed it with my patient so Carl Jung is seeing things uh from

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:08.940
the future it's this is fantastic um yes a vision through a patient and

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:16.139
suddenly the man is hooked he's drawn into the mysterium into the initiation

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.539
and how do we know that because we can extract it from him we can extract it

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:27.199
from Carl Jung he's bad and he deserves it he deserves what he gets

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:32.300
the Liebert noos the Lieber nois the new book

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:39.720
that Carl Jung wrote and then had buried until a certain time to be released

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:48.080
which has been released and scrutinized by every sort of critic

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:54.439
Authority academic you name it

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.880
let's look at it with the eyes of the bakkened

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.460
if we really were in charge if we were in control if we were sitting on the

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.819
throne for those of you with ears to hear if we were sitting on the throne of

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:18.680
Satan and we were able to reach into his

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:25.500
capacity to bring past future and present into one moment we would be able

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:33.180
to take young and magically transform him I want us to go where Young

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:39.979
tried to lead I want us to look at the the what they

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:46.259
what they call the Liturgy of mithras

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:53.580
yeah the Liturgy of mithras what is that that doesn't help I want to get down to the level Remember the Time ship I want

00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:00.960
to get down to their level and see what's happening okay so I'm taking you tonight on this Merry Christmas night

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:07.139
I'm taking you to the to the place

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:14.220
where all of this comes from I'm taking you to an actual cult ritual now word

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:20.639
has it the the profanation or the making comment of the cult ritual of the

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:25.979
mysterian will cause instant lightning

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:33.599
from Zeus upon the revelation if I'm bathed

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:40.740
in that lightning I will know the ion

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:47.640
let me show you um that drugs can make you high

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.980
or according to the magical papyri they

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:58.920
can make you Cosmic let's look at the ones that make you

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:05.940
Cosmic and again let's remain scientific about this I have no theories for you I don't want your cash I don't charge you

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:14.640
to ask me a question I don't want any of that corruption or pollution I just want the text and tonight I want you to look

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:21.260
as you Regale with a series of images I want you to look at

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.360
mithras and the liturgy and I want you to ask a couple of questions here I'm going to read to you

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:34.800
just the introduction and I just want you to follow along in your mind's eye be gracious to me o Providence and

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:44.160
psyche as I wrote These Mysteries handed down not for gain but for instruction

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.500
this is what young was referring to

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.779
so when we look at his magic book and I show you how to use it and break the

00:09:54.779 --> 00:10:02.100
seal um absorb the seal then don't be surprised

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:08.160
now watch watch this this is gorgeous um yeah he's invoking right he's it's a

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:15.360
prayer yes I don't write these things for gain he says but for instruction and four an

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.519
only child I request I think that's a bad translation because it's mono

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:26.100
remember my advisors Dr John Scarborough was one of the translators in this text

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:33.000
in this work um and we we oftentimes scrutinize translations and said ah it's just so

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.080
difficult I can see the translator's difficulty but you know it's tough it's tough so so

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:47.519
um here we go yeah um not only child but I'd say one I'd say one child so and for an only

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:53.100
child I request immortality that's what we're doing here at the mystery we're

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.500
burning off your mortality welcome yes welcome

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:04.680
um oh initiates of this one power

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:11.160
I refer to you it's nice which the great God Helios mithras ordered to be

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:18.360
revealed to me by the archangel there's directions in here to a little

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.940
an assistant what the Romans called an honest

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:30.740
yeah what are the instructions um

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:39.540
to take the juices of herbs and spices which will be made known to you at the

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:47.279
end of my holy Treatise he's going to say which drugs it is that she is supposed to produce right now wait a

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:52.500
minute I said it's he I said tea why did I do that for no

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:58.680
reason other than I've been living in the society I've lived in for the last 2

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:05.100
000 years yeah Why Can't This Be A she it would make

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:10.860
sense wouldn't it um it might as we read it you might begin to see all of that stuff that I

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:19.620
told you about the Midwife was there for a reason yeah we are burning off the mortality of

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:25.560
the flesh yes and why are we doing this so that I

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:34.079
alone may Ascend into heaven as an Inquirer and behold the universe

00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:39.120
get my Cosmic vision going okay so wait a minute where are we

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.820
I just stepped out of this time ship and into the middle of some kind of rave

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:52.680
yeah exactly so this is an operation historically this is an operation

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:58.139
um and we're about to get details we're going to get an invocation and we're going to get details about what to do

00:12:58.139 --> 00:13:05.399
and I want to read you a little bit of that because there's lots of drugs and there's lots of seeing things and

00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:13.560
there's lots of comprehending the universe yeah of of knowing oneself and you say

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:21.600
oh is this another introspective no no this purports to be something else if we don't have a new birth this is not ionic

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:30.060
life are you ready let's keep going first origin this is the invocation

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:37.820
right imagine yourself at the event first origin of my origin I

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.839
first beginning of my beginning

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:49.440
Spirit of spirit the spirit of the spirit in me in

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:58.139
um fire given by God to my mixture of the mixtures in me the first are we

00:13:58.139 --> 00:14:05.600
repeating this yeah right this is part of what we're performing nice

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:11.399
water of Water the first of the water in me there's a repetitious thing here

00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:17.220
going on we're not being given directions about what's happening okay Earth the material the first in the

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:24.779
Earthly material in me my complete body I blank and this is formulaic I insert

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:31.560
name here whose mother is blank wait a minute whose mother seriously

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:37.980
is this the patch Patrick lineal great stuff that I've been surfing under

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:45.300
yes it is but it's not it's uh it's it's starting to smell like women

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:51.120
perhaps the voice in the beginning who is invoking two female deities

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:58.800
in order to save a child maybe that voice is actually female

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:05.880
fantastic does Lucifer have a penis yes that's the question wonderful

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.399
wonderful wonderful wonderful okay so I so and so whose mother is so-and-so

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:18.779
which was formed by a noble arm and an Incorruptible right hand in a world without light and yet radiant without

00:15:18.779 --> 00:15:24.420
soul and yet alive with soul and then we have more worcus magikai

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:30.720
which don't let them tell you that they know what they're from they don't um and we know that for a fact because

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:38.519
the PGM says that it's using five different forms of something that it calls orphic gramata

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:45.959
yeah so um in my opinion the best safest guess will probably be old old Greek

00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:51.959
yeah yeah yeah Ellie Ellie Lama sabakhani is not

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:58.199
what Jesus said on the cross it's what Jesus said on the cross from the mouth of a magician

00:15:58.199 --> 00:16:05.339
performing sabach Thon that's why he's so thirsty you know okay

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:11.699
uh let's keep going give me over to Immortal birth and following that to my underlying nature so that after the

00:16:11.699 --> 00:16:16.980
present need which is pressing me exceedingly I make gaze upon the

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:22.260

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:54.059
let's get you up there you will hear nothing either of man or

00:20:54.059 --> 00:21:02.280
of any other living thing you won't hear so you know apparently your attention's focused on the Panic of

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:08.760
suddenly floating up into the air um not in that hour where you see anything of Mortals Affairs on Earth so

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:15.660
you wig out for an hour you're gone you're under for an hour but rather you will see all Immortal things okay what

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:22.620
are these Immortal things that everybody gets to see when they're under the influence of your mystery

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:29.159
in that day an hour you will see the divine order of the Skies

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:34.520
okay the presiding Gods Rising into heaven

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:40.200

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:45.900
Dawn oh my goodness I did hear Dawn

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:52.740
after the kufi I that I may gaze upon the unfathomable awesome water of the

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:59.039
Dawn those are those Waters of life you want to gaze oh and by the way they do this

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:06.240
at dawn right there's directions and the formula that Nero provides right we've got it

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:14.280
through Galen there's directions in there for what you're supposed to do in that pre-dawn session so this is right

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:20.460
before Dawn remember the early Christians all met at dawn why because there's a turn in because

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:25.520
Judaism and Christianity are saturnian Bronze Age religions

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.280
they are in the most basic Elemental way

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:40.380
they are satanic Judaism and Christianity are satanic

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:47.760
let's keep going shall we this is beautiful and so we've drawn in um so once you put your right finger on

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:54.659
your mouth there's more directions we're at dawn huh having our moment right freaking out because now we're floating

00:22:54.659 --> 00:23:00.960

magikai the magic words you know so imagine okay where are we

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:17.039
again we're at the ceremony it's fries of Dawn and all of a sudden I'm in this

00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:23.220
position where I'm entering this ionic life I've been drawn up into the air and

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:28.740
I'm scared and uh uh um I'm there for the dawn

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:34.500
and now I'm using that force of dawn to ground me

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:40.320
to keep me safe yeah Isn't that cool

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:47.159
symbol of the living Incorruptible God fantastic okay good good then make a

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:52.559
long hissing sound next make a popping sound and say more well case magika then

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:59.280
listen to this this is what you see you do you wanted to come along and see what happens in a saturnian initiation I'm

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:06.659
showing you what it is right I am profaning this mystery so that you can

00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:12.840
see what they saw you don't need to go out and try to re reassemble the crew

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:21.539
right you don't need to go out and figure out how to make these substances right you don't need to go and figure out how she can use them to put her into

00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:27.120
a state to cause him to go crazy right you don't need to you can see what

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:33.780
the vision is for and then we're going to bring it back to you because you're thinking young is Way Beyond that nope

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:39.179
nope Jung is right in the middle of this okay

00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:46.140
then you will see the gods looking graciously upon you and uh oh first they come and they Rush

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:51.840
at you it's a scary situation it's like you have to you have to adjust your

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:59.280
frequency because first everybody wants to kill you then you perform an action and suddenly

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:06.539
everything is normal they look at you as normal why you're being reborn you're being born into an element that you

00:25:06.539 --> 00:25:13.020
don't um naturally flow from right this isn't some kind of Guru

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:20.340
rediscovery of God the God within anybody who's sitting around with smoke in the air and give

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:26.520
feeding you that I'm God okay no no what we are looking at is

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:32.640
what the subjects of these experiments went through

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:39.179
and what they've visualized in the process and the the argument is the mystery see

00:25:39.179 --> 00:25:45.120
the mystery is not something stupid or mysterious the mystery is that reaction

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:53.220
it is that vision completely biologic I love it

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:58.260
completely organic doesn't smell like chemicals or big

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:03.860
companies or anything it's completely it's like a human it's like a human

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:10.860
programming you know it's in there it's in the genes it's in the nature okay anyway let's let's see immediately after

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:17.820
you've said these things the sun disc will be expanded oh here it comes to Young the sons look at this when we're

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:22.860
through coming through the initiation this is what we see we see the sun's

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:30.299
disc expanded hey that's why they're all into the solar worship stuff and after you have said the second

00:26:30.299 --> 00:26:35.700
prayer where there is silent silence and the accompanying words make a hissing

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:41.100
sound twice and a popping sound twice

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:48.360
yeah okay you're gonna you're gonna see this it's not too uncommon so there's vocalizations that go along right they

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:53.820
call the witches the Strega right the the streaks is the screech owl there's

00:26:53.820 --> 00:27:01.380
noises that go along with this form of uh right yeah so hissing and popping hissing and

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:09.299
popping yeah and immediately you will see what oh you're gonna love this many five prong Stars

00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:16.440
coming forth from the disc and filling all the air you see the stars

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:25.080
yeah yeah love it I Starion right this is this is um there's more about the drugs

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.740
and uh there's much more about levels of initiation things that are seen and

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:38.760
there's more about how to prepare for this what exactly you have to do and what kind of uh what kind of Acts that

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:45.600
you have to perform to get ready and um he tells you he tell or she or he

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:53.159
who's writing it tells us lick this up so that you may be protected

00:27:53.159 --> 00:28:01.260
yeah look this up so that you may be protected constantly we're constantly getting hit even the even the the

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:08.279
um the making of totems that will protect us during this process you have to have images to help protect you in

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:13.980
the in this Pro process now the phylacteries require this procedure copy

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:19.260
that for the right arm onto the skin of a black sheep with mer ink

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:25.980
yeah isn't that funny he's putting a song and he shows us what kind of song it is and long story short it's Homer

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:31.020
using the sortace so this is a necromantic this mithraic

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:37.260
liturgy is hearkening back to sortitic necromancy and if you have a problem

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:44.880
with that you can just um Saturn yeah something yes okay uh

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:51.539
what about young what about young I want to bring you I want to bring you to Young and why is it relevant so Jung now

00:28:51.539 --> 00:28:56.820
who's giving us his little example of the poor lunatic that gave him a vision

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:02.360
that he saw then later explained in this papyrus

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:08.940
in Paris that's this magical Papyrus that we just read right he he he's um

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:14.340
he's surfing on that ether and he comes

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:20.460
up with guess what an initiation ceremony surprise surprise

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:28.620
right um here's the neat thing he writes incantations and I'm going to take you through the incantations now and then

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:34.080
I'm going to introduce you to the devil just briefly I'm gonna let him ask a few questions and then we're going to

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:40.559
dismiss him here we go are you ready here are Young's incantations

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:46.559
um we'll start with this image Christmas has come

00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:53.340
the God is in the egg okay remember you're being initiated

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:58.980
congregation to Satan listen up Christmas has come the God is in the egg

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:04.140
I have prepared a rug for my God an expensive red rug from the

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:12.539
land of mourning he shall be surrounded by the Shimmer of magnificence of his Eastern land I am

00:30:12.539 --> 00:30:20.880
the mother the simple Maiden who gave birth and did not know how I am the careful father who

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:30.080
protected the maiden I am the shepherd who received the message as he guarded his hurt at night in the dark fields

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:36.480
I'm the holy animal that stood astonished and cannot grasp the coming

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:42.360
of the god I am the wise man who came from the East suspecting the miracle

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:51.720
from afar and I am the egg that surround and nurtures the seed of the God in Me

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:59.100
hmm the solemn hours lengthen and my

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:06.419
humanity is wretched and suffers torment since I am a giver of birth

00:31:06.419 --> 00:31:12.960
have you figured out the real yet where uh whence do you Delight Me O God

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:18.120
he is the Eternal emptiness and the Eternal fullness nothing resembles him

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:25.380
and he resembles everything Eternal darkness and eternal brightness does it sound like fanes to you you

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:30.539
should notice why because Jung is using that as his model he's using that as his

00:31:30.539 --> 00:31:37.380
model Eternal Below in Eternal above double nature in one simple in the manifold

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:43.200
meaning and absurdity freedom in bondage do you smell the

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:48.980
bakkens yes you're going to get to him right you're going to come to Bacchus

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:56.000
subjugated with Victorious old and Youth yes in no

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.700
o light of the middle way enclosed in the egg embryonic full of

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:08.820
order oppressed fully expectant dreamlike awaiting lost memories as

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:14.279
heavy as Stone hardened molten transparent streaming light coiled on

00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:19.559
itself and now my favorite part

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:26.520

amen you are the deer that breaks out of the forest amen you are the song that sounds far over the water amen you are

00:32:58.919 --> 00:33:02.960
the beginning and the end

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:14.480
one word that was never spoken one light that was never lit up an unparalleled confusion and a road Without End

00:33:15.179 --> 00:33:20.399
I forgive myself these words as you also forgive me for the sake of your blessed

00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:26.100
light yes rise up you gracious fire of all

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:34.320
night I kiss the threshold of your beginning if you are not tasting the orphic if you

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:40.080
are not appreciating the fact that his mystery is a resurrection of Antiquities

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:46.080
orphic mystery if you don't realize that you are at elusive that you are with the

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:52.500
Christ then you're not

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.399
born again

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:04.200
dancers await you the bakkens

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:11.040
let's continue on with an introduction to the devil bring up uh just bring me back to sinner

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.858
because I want people you know it's my passion to do this for you to bring you the

00:34:16.859 --> 00:34:23.878
devil is the thing that you know not many people get the privilege because he's so you know when the when

00:34:23.879 --> 00:34:29.760
the when the experts speak up about the devil when the experts speak up about the

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:36.599
devil they usually do so so condescendingly it was with such bad information there's so much about him

00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:43.858
there's so much about the dawnbringer why would you not why would you not bother to dip in I don't know

00:34:43.859 --> 00:34:52.138
um but this is the beginning of the second of uh book the second Within the uh

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:59.640
the new book written by Jung for a specific time to be released this specific time this is

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:06.540
the red one the door of the mysterium has closed behind me I feel that my will is paralyzed and

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:13.020
that the spirit of the depths possesses me do you feel possessed by the spirit of the depths

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:19.980
I hope you do I know nothing about a way I can therefore neither want this nor

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:26.520
that since nothing indicates to me whether I want this or that I wait without knowing what I'm waiting for but

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:33.599
already in the following night I felt that I had reached a solid Point are you ready I find that I am standing on the

00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:39.240
highest tower of a castle the air tells me so I am far back in time oh look at

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:45.960
this young was traveling in time my gaze wanders widely over solitary

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:52.500
Countryside a combination of fields and forests I am wearing a green garment

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:59.760
a horn hangs from my shoulder I am the tower guard I look out into the distance I see a red point out there

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.280
it comes near on a winding road disappearing for a while in force and

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:13.619
reappearing again it is a horseman in a red coat the red Horseman he is coming to my

00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:19.680
castle he is already riding through the gate I hear steps on the stairway the steps Creek he knocks a strange fear

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:25.619
comes over me and there stands the red one a long shape holy shrouded in red even

00:36:25.619 --> 00:36:33.780
his hair is red that's fantastic we could use him in the right then I think in the end he will turn out to

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:40.680
be the devil the devil says I greet you man on the

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:47.760
high tower I saw you from afar watching and waiting your waiting has called me

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:53.640
young who are you devil who am I you think I am the devil

00:36:53.640 --> 00:37:01.079
do not pass judgment perhaps you can talk to me without knowing who I am

00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:08.460
what's sort of the superstitious fellow are you that immediately you think you are the devil watch I'm sorry for what's

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:16.859
about to happen I'm going to bring you raw young and this will hit a nerve that's so deep I'll get 20 comments on

00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:23.640
this this one this is look we have to do we have to do it he deserves it you know he deserves

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:30.060
it the devil says uh so what are you

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:35.339
waiting for and young says I wait all kinds of I await all kinds of things and

00:37:35.339 --> 00:37:40.500
especially I'm waiting for someone of the world's wealth so for some of the

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:46.680
world's wealth excuse me you know and we all knew it it's disgusting

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:54.359
it's disgusting it's not Art For Art's Sake yeah yeah yeah

00:37:54.359 --> 00:38:00.960
um which we don't see here um to come to me he's waiting for the wealth which he hasn't gotten yet devil so I have come

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:06.359
to absolutely the right place which is where you'd expect the devil to be right

00:38:06.359 --> 00:38:11.400
to the person who needs punishment I have won in a long time through the

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:18.480
world seeking those like you who sit upon a high tower and look out for things unseen is that you in the midst

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:25.440
of the mystery are you in that position yes the devil is asking you

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:32.640
young you make me curious you seem to be a rare breed your appearance is not ordinary and then to forgive me it seems

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:37.980
to me that you bring with you a strange air what kind of area little punk

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:44.940
something worldly something impudent yeah now he's talking I love it

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:51.660
or exuberant or in fact something pagan it makes me want to go over there and

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:56.760
have another moment I won't I want something Peggy can you hear you

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:02.579
can you hear you okay good devil you don't offend me on the

00:39:02.579 --> 00:39:09.900
contrary you hit your nail in the head but I'm no old Pagan as you seem to think yum I don't want to insist on that

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:15.540
you are not pompous and Latin enough I like that sometimes young is funny

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:22.500
you have nothing classical about you you seem to be a son of our time but as I must remark a rather unusual one you're

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:28.500
no real Pagan but the kind of pagan who runs alongside our Christian religion

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:34.260
he's doing he's doing that all the time you true you're truly the devil says

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:39.599
you're truly a good diviner of riddles oh

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:45.060
you're doing better than many others who have totally mistaken me good for you

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:50.220
yeah good uh you sound cool and snaring says Young

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:57.720
have you never broken your heart over the holiest mysteries of our Christian religion are you ready we're about to

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:04.099
devil you're an unbelievably ponderous and serious person are you always so insistent

00:40:04.099 --> 00:40:10.500
I love that I love that did you see that in the interview he's there you saw that

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:15.780
I would before God always like to be a serious and true to myself as I try to

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:22.980
be blah blah blah young devil you're superstitious and too German

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:28.320
you take literally what the scriptures say otherwise you could not judge me so

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:34.980
hard you know a hard judgment is the last thing I would want but my nose does not

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:40.980
play tricks on me you're evasive and I don't want to and you don't want to

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:48.359
reveal yourself what are you hiding the red one grows redder devil I hide

00:40:48.359 --> 00:40:55.619
nothing from you you true hearted soul I simply amuse myself with your weighty seriousness and your comic veracity this

00:40:55.619 --> 00:41:01.680
is so rare in our time especially in men who have understanding at their disposal

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:08.040
I believe you cannot fully understand me says you apparently compare me with those whom you know but I must say you

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:13.859
for the sake of truth that I neither really belong to this time nor to this place

00:41:13.859 --> 00:41:19.740
listen to him it doesn't matter you're here so shut up

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:25.260
answer my questions you Little Fool a spell has banished me says Young

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:32.880
to this place and time nice I'm really not what you see before you

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:39.599
devil you say astounding things who are you then this is irrelevant

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:45.060
I stand before you is that which I presently am okay it's going to get ugly here it comes

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:51.180
why am I here like this I do not know but I do know that I must be here to justify myself according to my best

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:58.800
knowledge is that what you're saying to yourself I know just as little who you are and as

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:06.800
uh as you know who I am uh devil that sounds very strange are you something of a saint hardly a philosopher

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:15.660
Young then picks up in a few lines and says you are ensnared

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:21.240
in your own world but you might conceive that one can assess the worth of Christianity

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:27.780
correctly without being a downright saint he continues you're stubborn what I mean

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:33.960
is that it's hardly a coincidence that the whole world has become Christian I also believe that it was the task of

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:39.839
Western men to carry Christ in his heart and to grow with his suffering death and Resurrection

00:42:39.839 --> 00:42:44.880
and now the devil says hold your ears

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:51.660
well there are also Jews who are good people and yet had no need for your solemn

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:58.200
Gospels and Jung says you are it seems to me no

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:04.980
good reader of the people have you never noticed that the Jew himself lacks something one in his head

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:12.060
another in his heart and he himself feels that he lacks something now meet the devil

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:17.400
devil indeed I'm no Jew but I must come to the Jews

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:22.759
defense you seem to be a Jew hater

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:28.980
would you like to hear what Jung says when the devil puts him right in the

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:34.800
spot where he should be he says well now you speak like all those Jews who accuse

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.380
anyone of Jew hating who does not of completely favorable judgment

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:45.900
do these things sound familiar yeah you're reading the air of the time

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:52.859
of the ion while they themselves make the bloodiest jokes about their own kind since the

00:43:52.859 --> 00:44:01.020
Jews only do clearly feel the particular life and yet they do not want to admit it and that's all I can swallow

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:08.099
because he doesn't know himself right it's no wonder that the devil

00:44:08.099 --> 00:44:14.940
wanders what's happening to Young

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:20.160
you know we're taking it we're taking it to him

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:29.640
for writing a magic book with a seal yeah and we together can use the Throne

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:36.920
of Satan to find those places

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:44.640
that he calls Cosmic yeah no money

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:50.900
just art just reason

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:57.359
yeah thank you for coming tonight um we're going to talk now we're going

00:44:57.359 --> 00:45:06.060
to have Rob and I want to talk about a couple of questions that were presented and um hopefully we can keep embedding

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:12.900
keep embedding back in The Souls of the Dead

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:18.839
um this satanic the satanic right you might be surprised why the what the

00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:23.940
devil is doing there and you might when you get to the South Pole realize that

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:32.000
you really could be standing on on the North yeah you might just be disoriented

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:39.720
um Rob how are you Rob Justin yeah all right after that I'm

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:45.660
engrossed fully engrossed in there very very good isn't it you can hear me

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:53.460
okay because I've got a new mic yes no you your mic is lovely your mic is lovely bravo bravo you've got some

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:59.339
questions you've got some questions tell us yep we're going to go from Young

00:45:59.339 --> 00:46:04.380
to known as and we we want to um

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:10.680
it's lady Rowan Ali Rowan and she wrote quite a bit and I don't want to um kind

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:16.619
of paraphrase but I can't read the whole the whole chapter out like there's quite

00:46:16.619 --> 00:46:23.660
a few paragraphs so a kind of paraphrased and I hope I've got it right but like you get

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:30.720
she's worried you're gonna have critics she's she's like concerned as you're going to have critics regarding known as

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:36.839
and he's paraphrase of John and maybe some of that is coming through

00:46:36.839 --> 00:46:44.280
he's dying this yaka as you might be opening up yourself to

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:51.300
some criticism there and uh why would you choose a 5th Century

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:58.800
paraphrase over all the available Gospels yeah yeah good great question excellent

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:04.380
question and there's a there's a little bit more I'm afraid I'm sorry let me

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:10.619
answer that first let me ask that question yeah because could you put the question up on the

00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:16.740
screen please edit it possible yeah lovely thank you

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:24.420
sorry sorry what I would say right off the bat is that what am I doing there I am doing in

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:31.980
known as uh following the drugs right so all I'm doing is I am trying to assemble

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:38.040
uh the picture of antiquity from the perspective of the drugs and the drug users

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:44.460
so what I would say to her is what nonus does that's so important is that he

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:51.240
recognizes the sexual value of that drug not just the monetary value it's worth

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:57.839
so much and that's why it should have been sold and given to the poor but the fact that he presents her as she does

00:47:57.839 --> 00:48:04.680
with the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that he knows and why does he know that it's a sexual drug

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:13.140
um it's the same reason that Pope Gregory knows that rust on your vagina is chafing from robago

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:18.480
um the activity of the priestesses in the temple of Aphrodite who are

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:25.200
performing their acts and becoming chafed so I'm looking at numbness for the drugs and the drug references and

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:31.200
when he presents it within the context of her for example her sultry hair

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:37.980
um the muron starts to take on uh its native aspects so later on this is this

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:44.660
is what I mean if you go to die score these um or you go to Galen or you go to

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:50.099
scribonius and you start looking I would advise that I score these and you start

00:48:50.099 --> 00:48:55.920
looking at what the muron does and you just put together as a compound what all

00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:01.200
of its ingredients are used for and you see that it's you know used forever all

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:07.079
of its practical purposes and Antiquity whether it be a abrasion relieving or

00:49:07.079 --> 00:49:12.720
abortion inducing um that you look at that and say Mary is

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:18.240
carrying this stuff I don't need an argument I don't need a

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.400
conspiracy you know that lady Rowan we're just going for the evidence that's

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:29.040
why I like you because you look at the evidence right so look at the drugs and ask

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:36.720
yourself what is that muron you know diascortis you've got a great first century source that tells you exactly

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:41.760
what that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is so winonas brings up and one of the reasons I like those he

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:47.460
actually talks about the antidote that was given to Jesus on the cross and

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:53.280
um um uh you could also ask why would I use the Geo geoponica a Byzantine work

00:49:53.280 --> 00:50:00.480
on farming on agriculture because it talks about drugs and antidotes and it

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:08.880
says that that vinegar is the con is the name for the antidote to the dipsest just like known as right so what I'm

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:15.000
looking for and notice is the pharmacology the historians the religious historians the classicists

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.420
have not caught up with the sources they have not caught off with the

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:27.900
sources so when someone challenges um the easiest way to knock them off

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:36.900
their block is just to say hey have you read the escorties okay say hey have you seen Nero's magic

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:42.540
formula in Galen and they're not going to know any of that stuff they're not it's the big

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:47.640
weakness of been there in the business I can tell you what its weakness is but to

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:52.859
me that's comforting because that's the Avenue that we can take to take to get

00:50:52.859 --> 00:51:01.200
the real picture of what's going on is the drugs right now a lot of people have asked me they said they said um the

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:08.760
drugs what you're saying is you're they're using drugs and religious right and it always it's so disturbing to me

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:13.980
having read as much as I have from Antiquity not modern takes on it but

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:20.280
from Antiquity for somebody to step forward and say they were still questioning did you see what we just

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:26.520
read from the Greek magical papyri did you see how the drugs are integrated in

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:32.099
the vision so for the head of the department at the University of Wisconsin to step up and say

00:51:32.099 --> 00:51:39.540
um did Romans just wouldn't do such a thing is complete and total ignorance of the of the things that

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:48.000
she's supposed to be guarding so lady Rowan that's what I would say the um could we do we deserve more detail on

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:55.400
what uh um the precise action of Mary and what she did with the alabaster

00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:01.980
lady Ron you still have to argue with people about the alabastran you still

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:07.440
have to argue we have detritus from the last 500 years thanks to King James and

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:13.680
his knuckleheads right which by the way wrote a great work on demonology but his translation

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:19.200
is just you know just accept that this is the Hebrew that's just accept it

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:24.900
forget about the fact that of the Septuagint and how it says completely different things

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:30.900
right so yeah King James uh all influenced by a when people become

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:39.440
influenced by a Cause or an orientation or a a

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:46.800
bias where they want to set out to prove something you know you're in terrible shape just go to the sources and that's

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:52.619
what I would say was notice is just another way another support for the fact that they were using these

00:52:52.619 --> 00:52:58.440
pharmacological items and Mary was using one that's very popular to use

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:05.880
um by devotees of Venus for the sake of sexual health in temples get over it

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:11.160
right that's the that's the beautiful thing read the pharmacology people it's

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:16.380
not yeah it doesn't have to be as crafty as you think there's no theories I

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:24.359
please the last thing I'm going to do to anybody here is ever give you a freaking Theory right there's there's no there's

00:53:24.359 --> 00:53:30.960
no theories or like armpits every academic has them and only under certain

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:36.000
circumstances would you ever want to smell them yeah

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:42.300
uh another question Rob yeah that's a great answer that is um

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:50.460
were they mentioning the King James let's want to go back a little bit further in the early Gospels

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:56.880
and considering as known as is in fifth century then do you think it's possible

00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:04.440
with all the additions and all the editing that's gone on in the gospels that nonus could see through that

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:09.480
could see through the disguise if there was a disguise could he could

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:14.940
he see through that and penetrate with his language so he could leave it within

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:20.640
a text essentially yeah that's a good question that's a good question what I would do is I would

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:25.800
say okay let's be careful here we're investigators and let's look at the

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:33.540
language is known as picking up on cult use of language and that's not odd

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:42.180
um does Galen use technical uh language technical vocabulary for his medicine hell yeah did he get it does he develop

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:48.540
it through Hellenistic doctors like herophilus yeah oh yeah he does can you

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:55.319
track that language yes you can do the same thing with numbers he's using he's using highly highly highly technical

00:54:55.319 --> 00:55:01.740
terms right just like Galen galen's bit from Nero right when Nero's physician

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:07.800
when when he uses the word polypharmicon we don't have to guess we don't have to piece this together all we have to do is

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:13.859
look at the language and say what is that language preserving in the Amber right it's like the amber that's

00:55:13.859 --> 00:55:19.200
preserving that that B from 200 or 20 million years ago

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:24.780
I was a little bit off a factor of 10. yeah I don't know if

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:30.359
that answers your question but I feel good about it good yeah what else do we have yeah

00:55:30.359 --> 00:55:36.780
we're going to shift across now to um I'm struggling with the with the

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:42.960
pronunciation and even looked it up because she dies or Diaz in regards

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:48.660
saturnalia mm-hmm [Music]

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:55.140
yeah it's a good example is that a good example of the gender Trinity

00:55:55.140 --> 00:56:01.079
yeah let's yeah let's talk about God let's talk

00:56:01.079 --> 00:56:06.240
about God yeah who is the dispartier right is that Pluto's is that pluton

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:11.660
excuse me is that the wealth is that the king who sits on that throne

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:17.880
and um in the Underworld is that the guy who abducted the Persephone is that Zeus

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:23.579
yes people don't get this right away but um you do if you study Roman religion

00:56:23.579 --> 00:56:29.940
especially and you see the evolution of the god concept you know it's Deus right

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:36.240
in Latin in Latin from from uh in uh uh

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:42.839
Mycenaean it's got that dye gamma in the Upsilon or in the U in Latin

00:56:42.839 --> 00:56:49.920
right so it's you know is it originally you or V anyway

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:58.440
um so uh Deus despotier yeah is that Saturn and Cronus yeah is that Zeus the

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:04.319
one that we think of that rules Olympus the one that rules The Ether yes that is

00:57:04.319 --> 00:57:09.839
the Zeus right that is the Zeus well that dis Potter

00:57:09.839 --> 00:57:16.319
is just a Zeus of the cone which is that it's like a different

00:57:16.319 --> 00:57:22.440
dimension underworld transition Transit is underworld right but it still has this worldly

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:27.480
connotation it's like the underworld rules this place you don't realize that

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:34.079
right but the underworld rules this place would you be surprised to wake up and find that there was a separation of

00:57:34.079 --> 00:57:40.980
powers and that there was one power that ruled this ether and the other power that ruled okay well that's what they're

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:48.359
looking at that's the that's the way that they're viewing the world and all of this can be made visible to you if

00:57:48.359 --> 00:57:56.220
you can sit on the throne of Satan while you use these images while you search

00:57:56.220 --> 00:58:02.160
these images okay it unlocks it's part we're not supposed to tell it but it

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:08.160
works um yeah yeah I don't know any any other

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:14.280
questions I think we'll is that bad enough yeah that that's uh that that's okay

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:22.079
with me but what I'd like to do is talk about contacting you for people who like to contact I mean we

00:58:22.079 --> 00:58:27.780
have so many brilliant comments I love the comments I love going through them

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:34.380
and I just think they're fantastic what people are putting in and where we're at is we kind of I'd like communicate I'd

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:40.799
like communicate with people and have people be able to communicate with each other because YouTube You've Got it's

00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:46.500
it's limited you can't even copy and paste but unless that's just me maybe he

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:54.780
says but I'd I'd appreciate some suggestions I'd like to uh suggest maybe a dedicated

00:58:54.780 --> 00:59:00.299
Discord there is a Discord I think it's fantastic I'm on the Discord myself I

00:59:00.299 --> 00:59:07.319
think it's brilliant I like being on there a lot of people on there it's fantastic but I don't know if people are

00:59:07.319 --> 00:59:12.359
comfortable joining the Discord but definitely I'm not comfortable

00:59:12.359 --> 00:59:18.240
put in any sort of details on the on the YouTube comments I want to encourage anybody else to

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:24.000
so we've got a problem with how do we get in touch with each other and I'm

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:30.540
trying to solve that I'd appreciate some suggestions maybe some platform we could all join together

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:35.760
and discuss things with each other I mean that's that's the Discord essentially

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:42.660
but why aren't people all joined and and maybe there's a reason for that and what

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:48.180
I'd like is to solve that in the meantime would you be okay and

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:53.400
comfortable passing on messages through your email at the at the ladybug Babylon

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:59.160
website yes at the lady Babylon website maybe if you want to get in touch and I

00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:04.859
promise everybody uh that sends me something I'll be more diligent

01:00:04.859 --> 01:00:10.440
um uh I'll be as diligent as I can I can I'm up against

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:18.780
um teaching and getting people and this is the fun thing getting people to actually be able to uh translate with me

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:25.619
and to be able to look at the text and say oh my God I just translated that those moments you know it takes a while

01:00:25.619 --> 01:00:32.839
to get there it takes a lot of commitment and some students have it and some students don't right so um I'm I'm

01:00:32.839 --> 01:00:40.260
encouraging people uh who want to to learn ancient Greek to consider taking

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:46.140
up the cause it depends if it would be useful to you but what I can promise you

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:53.220
is that when I give you that ability and you have it where you're sharp enough you can go on to intermediate reading uh

01:00:53.220 --> 01:01:01.859
you know um uh then uh you'll be able to see how how that important it actually is I had

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:08.160
a new student today who came in and he was looking at logos just the word logos

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:16.859
and he uh is a religious um not a historian but uh an act he had

01:01:16.859 --> 01:01:24.059
he has an undergraduate degree in religious history and he was surprised

01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:30.119
um orgasmically surprised genuinely surprised at just the word logos and

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:38.339
what it actually means and I can promise you from experience that those of you sitting here do not

01:01:38.339 --> 01:01:43.859
know what logos means we could sit we could go into a Discord

01:01:43.859 --> 01:01:49.140
and I say hey offer me your definitions of logos and then I could take you and I

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:54.480
could show you and you'd be shocked but it's rational and it makes sense and it

01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:00.440
allows you to see how that logos was used so that when John says

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:06.359
um that you know not from a Baptist's perspective not

01:02:06.359 --> 01:02:13.079
from a catholic's perspective um not from a Scholar's perspective but

01:02:13.079 --> 01:02:19.619
from the perspective of the people who actually wrote the document that's invaluable that's invaluable that's the

01:02:19.619 --> 01:02:25.500
only way you're getting evidence if we're ever going to solve the crime of of the naked boy with Jesus we need that

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:33.480
we need hardcore evidence and um I appreciate everybody who's who's everybody who's been saying nice job

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:41.220

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:08.160

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:53.760
very much must point out that in this death morning that we're entering in

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:59.099
this period of morning Adonis of morning Jehovah we're not just we're not just

01:03:59.099 --> 01:04:08.099
mourning Jehovah we're mourning his son and his son's bride because our vision will show us

01:04:08.099 --> 01:04:13.980
what contradicts the fairy tale that reality that we're

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:22.920
all we've all grown up in um it's gorgeous uh saturnian

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:29.460
satanic Judaism Christianity yes what are the satanic

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:37.200
origins of Judaism and Christianity and don't tell me because your guy throws around snakes and and can do what the

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:42.839
Egyptians do with their hecats don't tell me that he is not

01:04:42.839 --> 01:04:48.240
a magician completely following saturnian look he even sets up an oracle

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.700
this is one good thing Moses sets up an oracle most people if you just tell him that it's gonna they're gonna be

01:04:53.700 --> 01:05:00.660
confused right Moses sets up an oracle yeah in the wilderness in a tent with a

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:06.420
bunch of smoking Botanicals and you go in there to what so that you can talk to

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:12.720
the god they call it in the Septuagint the telestarian that's the it's the place that's directed for you to meet

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:22.500
the God face to face um this is gorgeous I hope that someday people find out that Judaism is indeed a

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:27.900
Bronze Age satanic religion and that that's nothing to be ashamed of that

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:36.480
their roots go back not to the Hebrew and not to the uh not to the masoretic

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:44.040
tradition that's way late they go back to the saturnian oracular

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:49.200
cult that allows us to enter into a place of vision

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:54.420
yeah yeah you were yeah um uh maybe that was Moses we were

01:05:54.420 --> 01:06:00.660
