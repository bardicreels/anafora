this is a special lady Babylon what am I doing tonight tonight I am a addressing

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:39.320
the good people of Australia who are also devotees of the Gods of medicine

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.399
yeah what I'm GNA do is I'm gonna try to create a bridge tonight for you I'd like

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.200
to be able to bring you to the place where the medicine was happening in the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.360
ancient world and I'm going to try to sink you into that Matrix so that you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.640
can see how different what it is that we do today um how that's so strange

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.160
compared to what it is they did then or there advantages on either side I want

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:19.080
you to be able to skip across time just to look at the medicine and what I'm gonna do is look I'm a I'm gonna

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.599
introduce myself so that you can um feel a little bit more comfortable I'm not just the guy in the park with the trench

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:35.879
coat um I am Dr am Hillman and my PhD is in classical

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.800
philology that is Greek and Latin yes so

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.040
um philologists use those tools that allow us to access those written

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:56.599
sources from the ancient world my specialty was galin the

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.080
medicine right I did oh for my Master's I did a translation of galen's black

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.599
bile was about the plague that was going on oh God it was gorgeous

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:15.200
any then I worked on Roman Pharmacy and in writing a dissertation on Roman

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.159
Pharmacy I was told by my committee we um won't pass you unless you take out

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:26.239
the chapter on recreational drugs and any references to those drugs anywhere

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:33.519
else in the text um so I said fine and took it out and then turned it into a

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.159
book blew it up and sent it to St Martin's press and they took it and so

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:48.799
that's kind of how um I started off in my career um and what I bring to the

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.480
table is you know Classics should be a thing for

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.079
scientists um not for the keepers of humanities um I like to keep one foot on

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:07.959
either side of the fence so I want us to look at something a little bit

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.680
scientific and kind of follow these texts I think you're going to be very

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.759
pleased with h this portrait of medicine I'm gonna take 45 minutes and then I'm

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:26.040
GNA give you a chance whoever is here uh from Down

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.639
Under I want to give you a chance to ask questions and we can have a short

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:39.320
session here where I can take your questions and post them up and give any kind of answers that I can give or if I

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.680
can I can say I don't know um should be fun so I appreciate you joining to me

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.840
joining me tonight at lady Babylon and we're gonna go ahead and jump in chewy chew and jump into the

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.880
fight are you guys ready for this what am I bringing you before you bring it up

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.160
just to get you the background we're talking about Galen second century anod

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.800
doin he is a personal body physician to the emperor the current Roman Emperor

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.919
Marcus rius and he's the most prolific writer

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:25.000
of antiquity by far by far um thousands upon thousands

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.479
of pages many of them just about drugs I've got three volumes sitting here they're all can you hand me Chewy one of

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:39.520
those chewy is my pilot um here's volume 12 here's volume

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.080
12 this is uh I purchased this from John's Hopkins uh when I was a grad

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.479
student this is 22 volume set complete set of all of Galen published in 1826

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:58.800
there so um It's Greek right it's Greek just for people

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.360
to see it's Greek okay what is it uh it's basically

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.919
a physicians's medical text from you know civil

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:18.880
warish yeah here in the states yeah um anyo um I'm gonna be bringing you works

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:25.120
from those texts and let me tell you something nobody does this kind of work

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.319
in the last 10 years I did find a dissertation somebody's translating Galen um and I know there's another I'm

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:36.680
aware of another scholar out there who's an MD who also did a PhD with emphasis

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:44.199
and galin in Classics so um I know that there's a potential uh out there but

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:51.599
when I was in the field as a graduate student it was not acceptable my brinar

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:59.919
I wrote the book called The Chemical Muse and my brenmar classical reviewer said this is a dangerous book

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:10.240
um it shouldn't be read at a university right um yeah um now that same person is

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.400
writing um a book about Shamanism which will inevitably have drug use in it and

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:23.319
they asked what do you think about his Dr Hillman's work now well yeah no it looks like they're you know drugs oh

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:30.000
nice nice job people right what happened to me in my career was I was about 10

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.400
years ahead of uh the the curve and the

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.520
frontier as the London Times said about the work that I do the front uh it's

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:48.360
really the last Wild Frontier they call it of Classics I study the medicine and again

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.120
that whole volume that I just held up to you that's all drugs it's all drugs I

00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:00.800
have forgotten more ancient drugs um than most most people know of

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.080
total drugs how is that it's because of the

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:12.720
language it's because of the language the language of ancient Greek is powerful all languages are not created

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:20.000
equal ancient Greek is powerful and has a just a crazy high crazy high number of

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.280
of uh independent words um yeah and it does that by word

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:35.159
building and giving people who use it the ability to be able to coin words as

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:40.839
they lived right on a daily basis it's why we have so much so many hop Hawks

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:47.000
legina not because these words only appear in one place and we didn't find it anywhere else but because those are

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.640
the individual authors's Creations some authors create more than

00:08:52.640 --> 00:09:00.040
others and to watch the Artistry of ancient Greek it's humbling it's humbling makes you want to burst out and

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.640
tears oh God it's gorgeous okay here's what I'm going to do I'm going to give you an

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:14.079
article this article is about Galen when he decided hey I'm gonna go over to

00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:19.800
limnos and I am going to purchase 20,000

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:26.760
DM 20,000 pills from the lynian

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:33.440
Priestess who makes the lynian earth oh my god listen to how many

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.040
different layers okay so I'm going to give you an article and I had people look at it before and I put the link

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:45.720
there so I know you've seen it I want to oh F we look at the you um I I I know

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.920
that you've seen it but let's uh let's run through it hit the hit hit the first

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:57.880
star system chewy yeah this is from archeometry right archeometry fantastic

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:04.880
2008 ACC ing past beliefs and practices the case of lyni and Earth liy and Earth

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.880
is a drug very well known in Antiquity just in great reputation as a

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:17.160
Panacea this thing does so much it it Wards off poisons it takes the negative

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.279
sides effects side effects of those poisons that you've been using and it

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:30.240
turns it into a positivity wait what yeah they're talking about capacitating drugs oh my

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:36.720
God the the tech here the the pharmacological Tech is off the charts

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:43.440
watch this um uh yep give me the next one chewy

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:50.519
boom I just want to read this to you lynian Earth a medicine in the shape of a stamped clay tablet or

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:55.680
frogus from limnos Northeastern Greece was much

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.920
valued in Antiquity and in the postm medieval period is an antidote to poison

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:06.519
and a treatment for other ailments although it was among the first archaeological materials to be subjected

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:11.639
to chemical analysis in 1807 well that was yesterday there is

00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:17.079
still no clear understanding as to what made lynian Earth and effective medicine

00:11:17.079 --> 00:11:25.560
we argue that LM and Earth the artifact was not the same as LM and Earth the raw material we suggest a composition for

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:33.000
the artifact by scrutinizing the do doumentary evidence for its properties and by considering

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.680
the geochemical processes that led to the formation of the raw material and

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:44.839
the ritual relating to its extraction wait what you're going to talk about the

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:52.839
ritual what why the the study of the latter highlights the need for archaeological material scientists to

00:11:52.839 --> 00:12:01.519
recognize wait what are the what are these what are these nerds going to have to reckon with to re recognize ritual as

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:09.240
a possible manifestation of physical and chemical processes carried out inin the framework

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:15.800
of past beliefs and practices what do we have to do you can take it down what do we have to do we

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:22.600
have to consider that these drugs are being used and they're being prepped they're

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:29.279
being made in environments that are cult

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:35.279
we have to understand there's history here there's context right we can have lists of all

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:40.880
the drugs that they're using and their rights we can have those we do but what

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:49.240
we don't have is that environment that [Music] authentic antique environment this is

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:56.760
late Bronze Age I want you to be thinking where's all this Tech coming from it's coming from women with aop

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:02.839
poisons um and it's they're d dous you know what I mean um and we've got a

00:13:02.839 --> 00:13:08.480
technology that's developed of do and antidote this is a late Bronze Age oh

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:16.360
God like 1 1200 1200 BC right forget the E 1200 BC and what

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:22.560
happens what happens uh the drug knowledge goes through the roof and we

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:28.199
even have particular individuals historically they're noted

00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:34.839
as The Craft men that pioneered the field um and a lot of them are called

00:13:34.839 --> 00:13:41.399
witches right the most famous of which is media and she was known for having just

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:50.040
a phenomenal amazing pharmacological knowledge and she developed rights rights where she

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:56.639
would Christ herself and then turn an entire Community into a psychedelic

00:13:56.639 --> 00:14:02.160
dance oh my God it was bakic reality um

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:09.279
this lynian Earth that Galen is looking for this lynian Earth um is part of this

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:15.480
tradition there is a priestess there right there is a priestess there and

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:23.680
it's only through her that we get this once in a year um supply of drugs they

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.360
only do it she only does it once a year yeah and they make the drug it's got her seal on it it puts her seal on it

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.519
because for those of you who don't know if I'm living in the second century and

00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:40.560
I need to go buy some drugs because I just went to see my doctor and my doctor

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:48.120
said hey you need some drugs um why are they always throwing drugs at me it's just like today isn't it no not quite

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:54.440
not quite because back then it's the balance of the individual that you're

00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:01.320
looking to maintain right so everything in my environment that I use in these compound

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:08.240
drugs and when I say compound I'm talking 20 30 40 50 the mythics have 50

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:14.440
to 65 somewhere in that range right um ingredients different ingredients and

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:20.680
these are all plants animal products I've seen things used oh my God today

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:25.880
we're going to look at the grime that you can scrape off a boy wrestler's skin

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:32.120
did you know that stuff's a drug wow fantastic let's go oh is it

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:38.240
babies that's somebody from the Satanic congregation yes because they they want

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:46.720
me to note I think that baby blood was used as well um as a

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:54.040
Madison yeah fantastic yeah interesting um let's go to the next one boom so this

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.480
is the introduction Lim and Earth from limnos to the northern aan was a listen

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:06.240
Fame from classical Antiquity postm evil time hit the next one we already got that go chewy we're off one star

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:13.560
assistant by here we go are you ready ustus in his 12th century anod Dominic

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:20.360
com oh sorry his commentary on Homer's Iliad right he notes that the priests of

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.759
the metalsmith god hephestus were healing those who had

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:31.600
been bitten by snakes now he gives the Greek here thank you thank you for this

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.639

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:50.639
these other one Aon do you see the verb the verbs right there on the four on the third line down

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:56.639
Eon um from Theo that's where we get our word therapy in anglosaxon

00:16:56.639 --> 00:17:02.560
barbarism right we had to steal it from them because we're too stupid to thank

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:09.678
it up for ourselves thank you mother Greek thank you very much yes yes all

00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:16.480
languages are not created equal you know it's a shame it turns out you are who you are because of the language that you

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:22.520
speak can you believe that is there are we capacitating people yeah with with

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:30.280
the Greek this is wonderful um let's go to the next one please boom

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:36.960
yeah no wait did we do that yeah yeah yeah okay here I want to keep pointing out that we need still need that one

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.400
take that rediscovering medicine down for a second I want everybody to see what is

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:50.320
it what is it that they treat these Priests of Festus what is it literally I

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:56.120
don't want any theories I don't want any ideas I want to see what is it they're actually

00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:03.120
trading and it's that last word oh ofus those who are

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:09.919
otic bring it up you know how this works ladies and gentlemen this is from this

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:17.600
what you're seeing below you below me is a uh Oxford is the Oxford um lexicon for

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:23.400
Greek ancient Greek so all what we have here is a word and then a whole bunch of

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:31.159
different sources that use the word and what you can do with this type of lexicon is you you can track the history

00:18:31.159 --> 00:18:40.039
of the word because word meaning drifts over time your context determines what

00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:47.000
that word is going to mean and if you don't know different styles and different

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.400
periods and different Lexica you're in trouble that's what reading these

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:59.559

look here um also constellation that's nice nice we've got a lot of whenever we

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:50.679
get um old Bronze Age religion and remember there's no distinction between

00:19:50.679 --> 00:19:56.480
religion and Medicine There's no distinction all right okay good good I

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.679
want and you have to understand the connection to the Natural you have to

00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:07.600
understand the connection to the you know these your polytheistic n nature

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:13.480
lovers yeah and they're taking all their resources and Galen is traveling to

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:19.559
limnos just so he can pick up a whole giant batch of these things yeah it's

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:26.720
got to have the Seal of the Priestess of limnos or this stuff doesn't work and it's expensive bro as you can imagine

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.960
it's a cural it's cural you start taking this stuff oh God people at work they're

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.080
going to notice they're going to notice they're going to be whoa look at that Marcus aelius did other other people

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:44.240
were like look at him he looks 10 years younger W oh I love it give me the next

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.760
one these are the details you get in the medical side what are the now where are

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:57.280
we mentally I just told you the priests of aestus they treat people who are

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:05.559
ofus right and and we know we saw the ofus from that that is the first part of the word is a serpent like a draon we

00:21:05.559 --> 00:21:11.880
get our word Dracula from that one I like that one draon those are the dragons what are the dragons dragons are

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:18.279
Temple Guardians just like midusa the Medusa right they're Temple Guardians

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:23.520
they guard things Medusa usually guard individuals right and they have more of

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:29.320
a governing role whereas the dracones those dragons they're just there for the

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:35.840
security of that Relic you know in the case of the people who were researching

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:41.960
the drugs it was a song that was written on a golden fleece um by a woman named

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:48.720
media and we get medicine from her name isn't that awesome oh God I love it okay

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:54.039
we got to keep the track here um what what is that um deos what does it come

00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:59.799
from it comes from this verb dno right and it really means to bite if you look

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:06.799
through this to Chomp down to bite um but look how the the meaning of it is um

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:13.400
is gaseous look at number two Roman number two it's a pungent you know what happens when you get the smoke in your

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:21.000
eyes you got that bite you got that sting and what did the Greeks do they

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.679
did what they always do and they take the concrete and immediately turn it into an abstraction and then they can

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:34.400
play with it mentally and that's what they did look of the mind it means to bite or

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:42.640
sting yeah and what is it used of can be used of love right that sting do you know where

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:50.559
the love of Aeros comes from it comes from a bow it comes from a

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:56.840
bow yeah it's a toxin on the end of the bow we have one that's called cion that

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:02.679
I can shoot you with I can shoot you with and then um apply

00:23:02.679 --> 00:23:09.960
it to a medicated dildo um a leather the ones that I've seen leather right but um

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:16.360
apply it to a leather dildo and then um give you the medicine right apply the

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:22.360
medicine to your rectal um you can see how the lines between

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:29.559
sexuality and medicine and cult are totally blurred what is the symbol by

00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:36.240
the way we're on the island of limnos we're on the island of limnos and what

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:41.600
what do you find there on the island of limnos who it's the god priapus baby

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:47.159
it's the god Prius this old palasan God he's the god of the erection he's the

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:54.600
god of the erection yeah the Romans rub his statues fallace for the sake of luck for the

00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:01.960
sake of luck right and when I say luck I mean marital luck now is this medicine that we're talking

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:08.679
about yes if you want to treat depression like they did in Antiquity

00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:13.840
and you say would they use a whole bunch of drugs yeah they did but they did it

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:21.520
in a very very strange way um you can induce states of mania for the

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.799
well-being of the patient you know remember ecstasy

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:34.399
ecstasis is a a greatek concept and what is the idea based on the word it's a

00:24:34.399 --> 00:24:41.000
yanking out of yourself from your location it's literally what it is it's

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.320
a transfer of your Consciousness to a place that's outside of yourself so that

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:53.320
you can look at the person who is you that's what it says on the top of the

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:59.640
Temple of Apollo he's the oracular Divinity it says no

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:06.480
yourself know yourself and how can you do that you do that with rular mirror

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.200
magic and yes it involved a whole bunch of drugs and a whole bunch of

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:20.520
Rights the drug that gayen is purchasing to the tune of 20,000 of these things um

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:26.039
uh he's he's only he's doing it specifically via the

00:25:26.039 --> 00:25:32.919
Priestess because it's her l L that preserves the scientific knowledge of

00:25:32.919 --> 00:25:39.640
how to prep the drug it's pretty complex let's go by the way for those of you who think everybody who lived before you did

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:45.159
was a dummy um you got another thing coming let's go to the next one look at

00:25:45.159 --> 00:25:54.240
this what is it we're all looking for we're all looking for oyas oyas notice the sigma row root or

00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:03.919
St in English Sigma tal row you're going to see this gadfly it's a gadfly oh okay a gadfly

00:26:03.919 --> 00:26:09.600
look at number definition number two under Roman numeral number two any vehement desire insane passion you see

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.880
what we're doing we're taking the concrete and we're creating the abstract

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:21.799
and then the abstract has its own vocabulary if you keep reading you're going to find it means Madness and

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:28.760
frenzy Madness and frenzy Madness and frenzy um let's go up

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:35.159
wh go ahead flash that up chewy wants to Mesmerize look at that oh look at that

00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:41.640
now you know if you were a horse and you got bitten by Mr gadfly you know that

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:48.600
it's gonna induce a certain response this is where we get the word estris

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:56.039
from estrus from yeah estris do you understand the impulse now

00:26:56.039 --> 00:27:02.279
that is the oyst and how do you create this impulse you do I just told you you

00:27:02.279 --> 00:27:07.960
do it with arrows and arrow poison give me the next one give me the next one

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:14.559
yeah the cup of Babylon indeed right it is technically love it give me the next

00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:20.320
one um what are we thinking about when we're thinking about this oysters and this Mania that comes from the arrow

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:28.360
poison here's the name EOS I just want you to notice in Greek EOS what does it mean it means Arrow it means Arrow now

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:34.120
this next one EOS wait what it means another thing yes it means

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.919
poison as of serpents one of

00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:46.919
the no not one of the most leave that up for a second J the

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:54.440
most unattributed genius to human history is the

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.519
development of um reptilian

00:27:59.519 --> 00:28:07.200
Venoms yeah and the antidotes that will counteract those Venoms yeah and they

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.360
didn't look at it as counteracting they looked at it as um

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:19.679
potentiating right that thec that Beast that thec is a compound formula and it

00:28:19.679 --> 00:28:26.919
holds up the cup of Lady Babylon what is eos it's poison poison of serpents look

00:28:26.919 --> 00:28:34.240
look look look look look at at the bottom the very bottom poison it says in the Latin is weirus eos look what they

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:42.600
did they put a dma it's probably because the Romans are being influenced by the atrans and the Greeks in the north and

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:48.760
they're palasan phian or autous ancestors so

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:54.960
they're getting that dma it's a w sound it's an invisible letter in Greek isn't

00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:01.200
that awesome it's an invisible letter in Greek think of this think of this they

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:08.279
understood they felt where this letter actually was um weirus and Latin tell me

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:13.559
so that's why you see the V looking thing that's actually a w sound in In

00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:20.600
classical Latin bring up to the next one yeah bring it to me what is a weeders in Latin look it says it's from that EOS

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:26.000
right but what is it some slimy liquid yeah in particular it's used in the bad

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.159
sense of like a poisonous liquid poison a Venom right or a

00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:40.720
wus synonymous with wum what is wum vum is drug baby right um poison you can

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:46.440
translate it as poison too um and the funny thing is is that comes right out

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:53.799
of the Dawn star right out of the Dawn star how do I tell you that Venus do you

00:29:53.799 --> 00:30:00.120
notice Venus is in there yeah the root linguistically Venus why do I have Venus

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.480
associated with the drug give me the next one why do I have Venus associated

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:10.960
with a drug this is starting to get kind of strange look people in the paper they

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:18.240
told you we have to consider the the the context here the

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:24.000
religious context the ritual context because that's going to be changing things like the drug you want to know

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.519
what the drug really was right you have to know what they did to it how they prepped it and how they

00:30:29.519 --> 00:30:35.640
used it and we have that stuff in the absence of the conventional means to start a scientific investigation we take

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:42.840
the unconventional approach of attempting to arrive at the nature of LM and Earth by working backwards that is

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:48.880
from scrutiny of the existing evidence okay now watch this people we submit that this evidence should be

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:54.799
collectively encoded in the following major areas of study a the relevant text

00:30:54.799 --> 00:31:01.240
of classical authors wooo yeah you could have St St right there and I would have been like oh yeah baby you're now we're

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:07.039
there b the understanding of the nature of Clays okay you see what's happening

00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:12.960
we're bringing in an expertise we're going to do some geology we're going to figure out how

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:19.240
many angstroms those things are apart and then next thing you know we've got a better understanding I see of what the

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.840
what was at least in the environment of the drug before it was changed by the

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:33.240
Priestess um and see the numerous accounts relating to the ritual oh look at that they're

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:41.679
acknowledging that the ritual now is of value or is critical to understanding

00:31:41.679 --> 00:31:47.120
what the drug was I'm gonna say something okay you can take it down I'm

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:55.480
gonna say something it's gonna shock you there is no ancient mystery including

00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:01.799
Christianity including Judaism there is no ancient

00:32:01.799 --> 00:32:10.760
oracular mystery that does not use drugs yeah yeah they all do and there's

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:16.639
so many of them I can read gay and and just stuff goes in one ear and out the it's different whole bunch of different

00:32:16.639 --> 00:32:22.360
types of plants plants that we can't even identify properly and oh God you um

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.519
the poly Pharmacy is just um it's an understanding of our environment that we

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:33.399
we just don't have modern modern healthc care doesn't take this into

00:32:33.399 --> 00:32:40.480
consideration the balance that is in your environment it doesn't it doesn't do that let's go to the next one chewy

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:47.039
this is fantastic I want to we got to hurry up bring the devil are you ready for this okay here give me that one what

00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:55.480
is the cult context here is the cult orphic hymn to

00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:00.519
fesus yeah and you know what there that first line

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:09.120

00:36:59.319 --> 00:37:04.760
archeometry Journal um archaeometry said that um we

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:11.000
need to maintain you know to find out what was in those things what was in those Clays and Earths that they were

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:19.280
using right well and we need to appreciate the cult in order to do that well this is the cult name for hephestus

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.839
technos and look they give it the one example is what I just showed you from

00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:30.359
the orphic hymn to hephestus right this is one of those hop Hawks

00:37:30.359 --> 00:37:36.440
leina right it's only going to appear once because that author is pulling from

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:42.200
the air this concept what is techno Dias techno is from Tech which is the word

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:52.359
for art or skill or science science and dios is your diet it

00:37:52.359 --> 00:37:58.119
is your regimen it is your way of life so

00:37:58.119 --> 00:38:03.280
the way of life of our Divinity our lynian

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.440
God is a way of tech of

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:13.480
skill of skill and precision when you have to make calculations you're

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:18.760
functioning within a tech so what what is this this is a big sign that says hey

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:25.280
this Guild these people are educated as hell right and we've got to be careful

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:32.480
of what they're doing the greatest physician in all of Rome is Galen and

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:37.920
he's going to this liian Priestess he doesn't know how to do this process he know what it's about all he knows is it

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:43.480
only works if she does it otherwise it doesn't work and it's stuff is being

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:48.599
faked and gayen talks about that constantly the drug Market in Rome you

00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:54.119
lots of fakes and so doctors develop stamps seals Impressions that you can

00:38:54.119 --> 00:39:00.240
put into a pill and and and people can see it and say oh this obviously belongs

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:06.720
to doctor so and so he's reputable so we can use this one um gayen still doesn't

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.800
have that knowledge that the priesthood does so we're talking about technical

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:18.119
technical crafts these medical guilds these medical priesthoods these medical

00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:23.760
temples it's where all of the basic knowled is the anatomy the what we would

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:29.520
call physiology anything to do with growth anything thing to do um with any of the

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:36.720
hard the botany and um bro in to the pharmacology all of that stuff these um

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:43.400
these medical guilds priesthoods really is what they are they're the ones who are kind of

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.680
shouldering the the burden of all the knowledge yeah it's fantastic give me

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:56.280
the next one let's go sale I'm going to take a few more than five more minutes I'm prob taking another 15 but here um

00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:01.760
to paraphrase through his comments on cognitive archaeology to access Pathways

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:07.160
of thought via the means of proper scientific inquiry one does not need to

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:13.079
rely solely on methods of scientific analysis but rather on the explicit

00:40:13.079 --> 00:40:19.400
nature of the reasoning that sustains it in this paper we build a case for the

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:25.160
nature of liian Earth as an ancient medicine not on testing or analysis of a sample because we're not going to have

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:33.040
any of The Originals right but rather on the basis of reasoning out of the evidence available so doing we arrive at

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:38.119
a composition for lynian earth and the active ingredient Within by examining

00:40:38.119 --> 00:40:46.040
the evidence and focusing on the ritual of its extraction is the ritual a covert form

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:51.760
of both a geochemical process and deliberate

00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:58.119
benefic beneficiation right now unfortunately what you're seeing is that an invasion

00:40:58.119 --> 00:41:04.559
of church right it wasn't they were turning it they

00:41:04.599 --> 00:41:11.240
were yeah one of the weaknesses of this article is that it takes the entire

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:18.119
history of the drug and you have to realize that things are different when

00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:25.880
the classical priesthoods break down and are replaced they're forbidden and then

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:31.920
replaced um the knowledge is lost so if you're going to talk about anything

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:37.680
postclassical you're going to be you're going to be you know it's no wonder that you find this stuff doesn't actually

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:46.280
work um because you're using that corrupted pool of knowledge yeah and no

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:51.359
if if we're gonna have the stuff that works that sample that actually works

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:57.520
that has that ancient reputation of being such a great uh drug we're going

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:02.720
to have to go all the way back to the one that the lyni and priestesses

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:10.119
produced that's what we're going to have to do give me the next one chewy and you know it's not that hard to do that um

00:42:10.119 --> 00:42:16.040
yeah yeah uh believe that the sacred Earth blah blah the Alum oh here look at

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:21.680
the bottom the Alum bearing Waters of the spring DED right so what happens he

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:28.000
says the ritual of the extraction of this clay and

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:35.240
of the creation the ritual of the creation of this lynian earth right

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:42.720
um and manual processing imparted with divine blessing whatever it's it's off

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:50.200
uh what a procedure part natural part man-made that was carried out successively on a set of days year in um

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:55.800
year out this involves the redirecting of the Waters of the nearby spring over

00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:02.839
the pit from which the Earth was bring being extracted right yeah yeah the

00:43:02.839 --> 00:43:08.599
redirection was carried out deliberately in the course of a year the pit on its own would have provided no more than a

00:43:08.599 --> 00:43:15.319
clay used for po uh potting lowest grade or a clay blah blah blah with um uh

00:43:15.319 --> 00:43:21.440
those different constituents in it and he gets down to he says the Alum bearing Waters of the spring deriv from alanite

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:28.000
Rich rock below would have been absorbed by the clay enriching it into Alum which we believe to have been the special

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.720
ingredient now notice now go ahead and take it down notice that he's um he's

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.880
concerned about what is the one ingredient what is the one thing right

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:45.440
what is that one communion what is that one drug they

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:52.079
were using um Greco Roman Pharmacy is so

00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:57.319
far Advanced um that they would never be

00:43:57.319 --> 00:44:02.400
asking the question which drug is the one doing the

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:09.559
job remember we're we're talking about balance we're talking about changing

00:44:09.559 --> 00:44:18.319
human physiology by means of the balance that's in nature

00:44:18.319 --> 00:44:23.440
that's why it's good for you to have some Venom every once in a while yeah

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:30.559
fantastic let's go to the next one see what they do these people are using Venom by the way right the Venoms the

00:44:30.559 --> 00:44:36.319
Venoms are all um they affect growth oh my God

00:44:36.319 --> 00:44:42.119
chronic imagine this chronic Administration how are how are they go ahead and leave that up but how how do

00:44:42.119 --> 00:44:48.240
they ultimately these Venoms how are they administered right you make a compound

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:55.720
drug with the Venoms in it and then you impregnate a strip of cloth bandage and

00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:02.680
you put it over wound wounds that you have self-inflicted is that nice um and you

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:11.319
get a chronic administration of your Venom enriched um formula and yeah it's to

00:45:11.319 --> 00:45:17.400
watch what it does to growth is amazing it's amazing the stuff that that they

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:24.040
were doing in Antiquities is um is mindblowing when you get into the tech

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:30.160
when you get into the remember these Works in and Greek these are never these are not translated these are not

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:36.520
translated right why because classicists are um are not trained in The Sciences

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:43.440
traditionally so it's it they're it's like struggling go to the next one it's like struggling with the you know giant

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.880
gorilla documentary evidence for alum galin says Lim and Earth is a stringent

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:53.960
this is powerful evidence that the Alum is a significant opponent of Li and

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:59.160
Earth as there are very few potential stren substances so look what is he

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:05.359
doing he's interpreting let's just see what the source says let's just see what the source says blow it up Tre this one

00:46:05.359 --> 00:46:14.079
the print is terrible on this one blow this one up whoever did this for that article shame on you you should be go

00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:21.280
back yep blow that one up thank you so much um here we go watch this Tuton

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.280
de yeah

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:36.119
yeah so the lynian Earth has the

00:46:36.119 --> 00:46:43.000
strongest effect it has the strongest capacity of all the

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.880
Earth and you say wait a minute what am I talking about those

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:57.800
Earths the you got to leave it up those Earth are um what you get from

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:04.200
metalon metalon sounds like metal it's not metalon

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:13.119
reminds methon Minds when you are digging into the dirt to

00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:21.119
harvest to farm out those medically Active Components that create the

00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:28.800
balance those things um you you're creating Earth

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:36.599
Earth and the lynian form taken at this one time a year by the same Priestess

00:47:36.599 --> 00:47:42.480
right or the same Priestly line I should say um that uh that this is the stuff

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:48.079
that really works and you're G to want to say oh it's one thing it's one

00:47:48.079 --> 00:47:55.160
ingredient because that's how our Medicine and Pharmacy that's how they're oriented what's the one drug right no no

00:47:55.160 --> 00:48:00.640
no no the thing compound here and he says uh what else do he say he says it's

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:06.920
got a stipic power in it it's got a stipic power in it go to the next one

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:12.880
this is a what that word stipic is coming from it comes from this Greek word

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:18.160
stepsis which means a contraction you know it's a stringent causes you to stop

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:23.920
bleeding right causes you to stop bleeding and dying now wait a minute is

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:32.359
dying medicine yes in Antiquity dying is medicine all you Baptists out there who

00:48:32.359 --> 00:48:37.839
have been died in the purple and have been to the death and the resurrection

00:48:37.839 --> 00:48:44.680
those of you who have been there know what I'm talking about you've taken that thos seone that death inducing drugs

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:52.079
wait a minute you mean they even had death inducers yes why because when you

00:48:52.079 --> 00:48:57.200
put somebody into a death State under the right conditions and you bring them

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:04.599
back using the proper aola the proper images we get idolatry in in English

00:49:04.599 --> 00:49:10.480
from that when you have the proper images you can give somebody a new

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:17.240
life how's that you send them to the other side and bring them back you know what that does your

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:24.720
psychology let me tell you something medical professionals of Australia um for those of you who have

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:33.680
ever had to deal with patients of mental issues psychiatric issues psychological

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:39.880
counseling any of those you can take certain types of

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:46.640
patients like the splenic melancholic people and you can put them through a

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:52.280
week of fasting give them a drug drop them into a cave full of

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:57.799
snakes and after 3 days pick them up on the other side don't worry there's water

00:49:57.799 --> 00:50:03.920
in the cave and although it's completely dark if you follow the stream you'll get

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:09.160
eventually to the outside have people died doing this yeah but you know you got to break some eggs baby for the sake

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:16.200
of mental health right when you get to the other side they call it you look like you've come from the cave of

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:24.359
tronus right it means that you're completely and utterly destroyed and Afraid terrorized why because they gave

00:50:24.359 --> 00:50:32.480
you a psychosis inducing drug when they dropped you in there now my question for you

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:39.119
modern uh health care and Allied Fields you

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:46.520
know we would never do this I don't care what side of the globe you're on we would never do this but for some reason

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:53.040
you could take a person who's depressed and you can cure them of their depression and it's a one-time

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:58.799
deal is it something to do with all of the brain chemistry I'd like to think

00:50:58.799 --> 00:51:04.880
that was an elegant elegant part of it yeah um but you know hey might it may be

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:11.480
fun too maybe you've got maybe you've got some people you counsel or you've got some patients who would be well

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:17.200
served by getting dropped into a cave full of snakes um after taking

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:23.960
psychotropics yeah it it may now the other one that was I did read gayen was talking about the cure for one of the

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:31.240
cures for um a type of um I guess the best way to call it would be manic um

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:37.280
depression um is involves intercourse right drugs and intercourse which you

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:44.119
never think about that either right but at what point you know what they're doing is they're working with the brain

00:51:44.119 --> 00:51:50.040
right and um at what point do you stop and say okay what are the drugs that they're using what are the effects that

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:57.520
they're having on the brain and how does the sex act that's involved how does that sex act reset brain as well is

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:04.160
there something that your brain is doing while orgasming that is different and those drugs are affecting it in some way

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:11.319
and that's going to cure your depression right we're cleansing ourselves they're they're looked at as

00:52:11.319 --> 00:52:18.319
purifications purifications and you'd be surprised at all the mental health care that ancient Physicians are wrapped up

00:52:18.319 --> 00:52:23.480
in you'd be really surprised at all the mental healthc care drugs amazing

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:29.000
beautiful stuff beautiful stuff let's go back oh oh god um yeah I'm on a little

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.480
bit of a extra rooll but I'm going to give you everything look at this gayen

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:40.040
makes it clear that lmy and Earth should not be washed more than once I'll just tell you that really he says look um the

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:47.720
other stuff you got to wash it a couple of times right two to three times he says but the stuff that is already

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:53.359
prepared by the Priestess don't touch it don't do that right you're going to

00:52:53.359 --> 00:52:59.200
alter it and the author of The you know article makes some conclusions about well what this mean it must mean there's

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:07.160
a soluble component that's being washed out of it right okay well that's nice this possibility yeah great observation

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:12.960
sure um and uh altered rocks that are red oh now he's going to start talking

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:20.720
about what are the other ones look we get alanite alanite an insoluble pottassium aluminium sulfate that forms

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:25.960
on relatively high temperature hydrothermal acid sulfate alteration of

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:33.319
Volcan rocks oh my God that is perhaps the nerdiest thing I've ever heard in my

00:53:33.319 --> 00:53:40.440
life um but you know that's great science people there's SE this paper this is trying to track down the two

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:45.880
authors they're trying to really track down what is it in the substance but

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:50.920
they recognize at the same time that we're never going to figure out what it

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:58.599
actually did because we don't know all the cold we don't know know all the um science

00:53:58.599 --> 00:54:05.720
behind the cult what is it that they're doing in their preparation the drug you know they prepare drugs in the human

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:11.160
body they you're taking the body and you're tweaking it to the point that the

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:19.319
body is able to produce a communion media did this the first she used her

00:54:19.319 --> 00:54:25.079
vaginal excretions why she kept her drugs there

00:54:25.079 --> 00:54:30.680
yeah wait a minute what not in a little you know I don't know I

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:37.160
can see a sack or baggie or I don't know maybe something even nice you know cigar

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:42.200
box or something like that um she kept them where in her

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:47.920
vagina yeah those ones that Christ you that she

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:59.880
figured out they're prepared via human filtration she used her V China as a um

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:07.200
Factory one author flacas calls it a it's not really a factory it's the the

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:12.720
means the black box that you can put something in that creates something else

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:19.480
right it's that mortar from the mortar and pestle right that's how he phrases it

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:25.599
for her vagina right and she's not the only one we have examples of vaginal drugs we

00:55:25.599 --> 00:55:36.559
have others in especially in the oracular tradition with like the god Apollo yeah so there's a completely new

00:55:36.559 --> 00:55:41.720
Dynamic approach to what the existence

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:49.720
is in a state of health you are in a state of balance with those Wild Roots

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:55.240
that are out there and those things that grow on the trees and um all of those

00:55:55.240 --> 00:56:01.680
fruits all of those fruits and you know some of those fruits come in the form of animals and there's certain animals you

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:10.520
can lick and certain animals let's go to we need more body fluids in here let's go to the go to the next yep boom um

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:16.760
Alum look he's just going to talk about Alum that's great that's great I let's keep going because I don't want to keep

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:22.640
holding people too long okay breakr keep going this well this is what we're concerning people ultimately just comes

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.920
down the paper says is it Alum is it

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:35.079
is it Mont marinite is it hematite keep going yeah

00:56:35.079 --> 00:56:42.760
lynian Earth appears to have been first recognized as a pigment but not as a medicine oh so what are the authors do

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:48.839
they go back to as many references as they can they can't to the drug or to

00:56:48.839 --> 00:56:55.400
the um substance that's ultimately used as a drug or medicine and they can't get

00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:02.319
they can't pen petate into the cult so they can't see those seeds of fire right

00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:07.480
um so we have a combo here okay we're just going to throw those out it may have something to do with one of these

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:13.079
one of these substances right right okay um and he says at once it's called meal

00:57:13.079 --> 00:57:18.359
toast right and that's the dye that's the Dy okay we're Dyers we're religious

00:57:18.359 --> 00:57:24.359
Dyers who trans um who who uh are able

00:57:24.359 --> 00:57:31.039
to cross a a Quantum barrier yeah to the other side I

00:57:31.039 --> 00:57:36.119
get it okay kind of makes sense um we've got wheat rust in there I just wanted

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:43.119
you to see that that red wheat rust and robigo and then all of a sudden we start talking about is this medicine yes but

00:57:43.119 --> 00:57:48.559
we're talking about drugs that can be used to enchant and you say to yourself

00:57:48.559 --> 00:57:54.640
what now if you've ever been a counselor or um psychologist psychiatrist say

00:57:54.640 --> 00:58:01.200
you're a psychiatrist and you've given drugs you've given out your prescription to somebody what you are doing is you

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:08.640
are enchanting that person you're putting them into a state that they're not normally I'm going to be in right

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:16.880
now they looked at it positively in Antiquity they looked at it as you are taking away the pain and you are

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:25.200
replacing it um with an artificial but naturally embedded power and that's

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:32.039
namely those drugs go give me the next one oh God look at this people are a word for Toxic by the

00:58:32.039 --> 00:58:41.880
way comes from tox Salma and what does that mean in Greek it means Arrow Arrow remember the Greeks said

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:47.480
before they got there the autoist people were um the

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:55.520
pans and these are um horse cultures that developed ultimately those poisons

00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:04.760
that the cians then um push and use right media has 12 cyan assistants who

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:11.359
were known for their drug knowledge as well right so you know this is a big deal by the way media also built a

00:59:11.359 --> 00:59:16.520
gigantic Bridge underneath the Euphrates river right with all sorts of beautiful

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:22.200
stuff on the inside so um if you thinkk you know better you don't you don't you

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:27.240
know what I mean you can't how can you get more beautiful than that let's keep going boom

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:33.880
conclusion in this paper we offer the bulk composition of limni and Earth the medicine as being essentially a clay

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:42.680
consisting approximately 40% 35% 20% and 5% now how closer are we to anything

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:48.799
historically do you see how this type of research is difficult because what have we really learned okay all it gives us

00:59:48.799 --> 00:59:55.559
is like a a shadow of what the ingredients may have contained right

00:59:55.559 --> 01:00:01.799
notice I say contained not what they were what they contained in the processing what is she

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:07.200
doing in the processing of this drug and that's the problem that you have to go

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:15.920
to the cold to be able to penetrate to to get those answers give me the next one

01:00:16.319 --> 01:00:23.240
boom yeah this uh the ritual of extraction at the bottom provided a means for concentrating both clay and

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:28.480
soluble minerals okay so all of that brings us to that

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:34.920
conclusion right that there's got to be something that they're doing in the process we don't know all the details we

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:40.119
know we don't because people like Galen didn't right and so they're keeping this

01:00:40.119 --> 01:00:45.640
within their Guild yeah so it's not I don't know if it was that I if it really

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:51.400
matters that we got um no we don't need to see that go to this one please nope

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:56.880
this one I'm gonna hurry up here now here in the end I want to just I I want

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:03.160
to so we have that paper and I want to introduce you to just a couple of ideas that are in the environment of the cult

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:10.240
that you may not have picked up on but certainly would influence how we're looking at these the manufacturer and

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:17.359
use of these drugs kisos what is kisos it's well it's cloud of dust right but

01:01:17.359 --> 01:01:24.400
it's also that mixed oil and sweat on wrestlers and that stuff is potent man

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:32.319
you can make you make some pot putting drugs out of that um look at number three it's also a demon of the same

01:01:32.319 --> 01:01:37.400
class as Prius now wait a minute and you're gonna say oh you're gonna feel

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:43.720
your modern world kind of breaking down what do they mean it's a demon it's a

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:51.000
demon a diamone is a power a gospel is what a drug

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.680
does yeah an Evangelion a gospel are you kidding me the word before the

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.760
Christians um way later than Jesus started started referring to it you mean

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:09.000
that that meant uh the capacity of a drug compound yes that's its gospel it's

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.559
what it does to save to bring soia or salvation you didn't think it was odd

01:02:15.559 --> 01:02:22.319
did you that Jesus is the old great physician right because all of those christs are right they're dealing with

01:02:22.319 --> 01:02:28.079
drugs now look at here at the bottom a demon of the same class as Prius Prius

01:02:28.079 --> 01:02:34.640
is the god on limnos with that giant erection that giant erection that's

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:40.839
where we get our anglish term priapism yeah they called it sosis in

01:02:40.839 --> 01:02:46.319
ancient uh both Greek and Latin use that and it means that you've got a constant

01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:51.400
erection now the Physicians said seven days is the long as you can go this way

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:58.359
using these cult drugs seven days of sustain erection otherwise they said people die I wish I don't know maybe it

01:02:58.359 --> 01:03:04.640
was cardiac I don't know what it was but I can imagine that a stress on the system physiologically you know what I

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:10.039
mean I'll let you healthc care people figure out what causes that somebody

01:03:10.039 --> 01:03:15.119
give me a give me a response if you know it and what is this

01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:22.359
conos what what is this that I this is the word that we were just looking up right the stuff that you scrape off of

01:03:22.359 --> 01:03:28.319
naked wrestlers right it's got the sand for your Arena on them and everything um and

01:03:28.319 --> 01:03:34.799
what is this book that we're this source that we're looking at it is hus and he is an ancient lexicographer and he's

01:03:34.799 --> 01:03:40.480
going to tell us he's going to Define it for us in Greek so he says the conos is the

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:47.279
conos thank you seriously okay and what is that it

01:03:48.319 --> 01:03:55.799
is it's a dirty Amorous dance where

01:03:56.559 --> 01:04:01.680
i o where your genitalia are stretched

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:08.200
out right right okay wait a minute do I need that drug for this it's all

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:16.240
connected give me the next one you're in the medicine people need deep look at it what is a what is a con ortos it's dust

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:21.520
raised or stirred okay it's dirt but look at the bottom a dirty fellow that's

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:28.359
the a dirty fellow that's the Victorian way of saying that dirty dance that the

01:04:28.359 --> 01:04:34.720
con Salos does by shaking himself in a certain way to get you to be able to

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:41.160
enter into the right right um that's here we've got it okay fine what do we

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:46.480
have to do we have to there's somehow we can use the sweat of this business figure out what's going on look at these

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:53.599
texts I know you don't believe me look at these medical texts I'm about to bring up hit me with the first one this is Galen people pure medicine in this

01:04:53.599 --> 01:05:00.279
section he's writing p OS what is that oh it's a hros it's

01:05:00.279 --> 01:05:06.680
sweat it's sweat he Oh my he went to Great Links to talk about medicinal

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:12.240
varieties of sweat did you know that the people around

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:19.559
you um have sweat that can be used in the composition of

01:05:19.559 --> 01:05:25.279
medicines interesting what about this one what kind of substance is this Petty

01:05:25.279 --> 01:05:31.920
uru uron right you guys are going to recognize that one right that's urine I

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:38.760
have never seen so many references to urine in my life is when I started

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:46.319
reading galin um that's also because they use urine as a method of diagnosis

01:05:46.319 --> 01:05:52.039
so when you come to me and you're like hey hey Doc um I've got you know I've

01:05:52.039 --> 01:05:58.279
got this thing going on kind of dizzy and um you know first thing I say is let

01:05:58.279 --> 01:06:04.279
me drink some urine yeah so you drink your patients

01:06:04.279 --> 01:06:14.559
urine and the act of doing that allows you to use your mind to determine uh

01:06:14.559 --> 01:06:23.240
what the state of that ill balance is right so if your urine looks this way

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:30.119
if it smells this way you know you can tell from the smell Gay's big on smelling urine he's big on smelling urine he's

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:36.640
always smelling urine it's patience urine give me some urine right um but it's a way to diagnose because you're

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:44.559
dealing with the natural if you can go out and pick up a toad and lick its

01:06:44.559 --> 01:06:52.640
whatever and enter into a mind altered state um it surely makes as much sense

01:06:52.640 --> 01:07:01.079
to say you can gain Knowledge from the body products the the

01:07:01.079 --> 01:07:07.720
bodily products of somebody of another person yeah so you can see right away

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:15.480
the line especially with the sexuality because remember the priestesses are blamed as being prostitutes later right

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:21.279
so the acts that they're performing um

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:56.200
there we are chewy fantastic couple of Tie fighters um let's to the last couple

01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:02.960
of slides what else we were at sweat and urine what else are we going to be testing here oh people look now this is

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:08.599
the big one are you ready P pomon poron right what is this this is a

01:08:08.599 --> 01:08:17.719
special communion formula made from the porur from the purple right oh God right

01:08:17.719 --> 01:08:22.758
you mean they drank that stuff they used to dye stuff with yeah they did and they

01:08:22.759 --> 01:08:31.560
also used it rectly and O L right love it love it it stains by the way Heracles

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:37.679
dogs all drank it and it stain their lips purple keep going dogs are all

01:08:37.679 --> 01:08:44.880
another form of Temple Guardian I know that only because they said that in Antiquity right oh dragons and wolves

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:51.640
those are those are Temple authorities look at this what else do we need we need spittle did you ever notice that

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:59.838
Jesus was spitting in people's mouths and eyes spitting on the ground putting it in people's eyes ah right here it is

01:08:59.839 --> 01:09:06.000
the spittle Galen has an entire section in this one at least in this one um

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.480
tradus on the use of the spittles and what kind of different spittles do what remember when you see these ancient

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:19.159
Physicians SL Shaman represent they're always doing crazy stuff with their own

01:09:19.159 --> 01:09:26.520
body fluids right the masters of Greek democracy who were

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:33.640
influenced by people um to push the world towards um what we call democracy

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:40.798
um those those people were using drugs epines was using

01:09:40.799 --> 01:09:47.440
drugs they took his skin off him when he was done and they turned it into a relic

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:54.238
and the Spartan F Force watched it guarded it keep going um do we see how

01:09:54.239 --> 01:09:59.760
much drug use is going on it's amazing and finally milks milks and the

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:07.520
strangest milk that I've seen the strangest milk that I've seen is the milk of the parthenos and in this tretis

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:13.600
of galin he talks about what to put on the breasts of the paros he doesn't just

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:21.120
call them mo he doesn't use the word Mone he uses um teos which is or ton

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:27.320
which is a uh grapelike breast it's a developing pre you know kind of early

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:33.840
puberty developing breast right um and he talks about the milk from that and

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:40.159
what it does and what it looks like um yeah so you can see so if gayen is gonna

01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:46.040
have access to that level of knowledge um you know that's probably the tip of

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:53.679
the iceberg for what the Priestly crafts are doing right um but you know I never

01:10:53.679 --> 01:11:01.040
thought I never thought of harnessing body fluids um that are being used in

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:09.159
medicine until I started seeing how they were creating these Medusa um and that's

01:11:09.159 --> 01:11:15.560
when I noticed the lateral slits and the arms and the constant exposure they also have whipping they'll do this thing

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:21.920
where they whip the back and then they'll apply a Sav to it something about the release of whatever it is that

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:27.760
that whipping action does whether whether it's adrenaline or whether it's

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:32.800
but um they're using the drugs like imagine your doctor never tells you take

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:37.880
this medicine go home and you know have your

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:43.400
wife you know beat you with a cane while you take the medicine well I don't know

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:50.159
doc does that make does it make a difference um with the medicines they're using it makes a big difference but

01:11:50.159 --> 01:11:57.400
they're also claiming to be able to control things that we're not able to control um the mental illness for

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:04.719
example um also they have cancer treatments um they have um Galen uses

01:12:04.719 --> 01:12:11.239
lni and Earth on a breast and I was talking when I was in grad school I was talk because I I was privy privy to

01:12:11.239 --> 01:12:19.120
these texts and I got my bacteriology advisor and I said hey can we sit down with some of the people from

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:24.800
bti microbiology and Classics and can we have like can I give a paper on this

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:30.520
cancer cure and maybe we can come up with what the hell's going on and we had

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:36.239
a nice discussion about it but um it was basically guesswork it was it you know

01:12:36.239 --> 01:12:42.880
well it could be something you know some one person said it could be some kind of radioactive element in the ground in the

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:49.639
clay that was causing some kind of you know deterioration because gayen says he takes it he puts it on the breast he

01:12:49.639 --> 01:12:55.800
sews up the breast and then the lump goes away it dissolves right um

01:12:55.800 --> 01:13:02.480
so I don't know we got to some interesting possible conclusions just like this paper did but the fact is

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.320
until we get into the source cult um we

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:15.000
don't you uh we don't have a hope of ever trying to really you know achieve

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.360
what they achieved or get to what level that they got to give me that last slide

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:25.480
I want um I just wanted to end here by saying look this is uh this this is a

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:32.840
priest writing this he's writing about thcs and he says hey this limni and

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:40.159
Earth and he uses the word milto here MOS here right which is um what the guy

01:13:40.159 --> 01:13:49.719
in the paper was talking about but what does he say at the end on that bottom line he says it is a tharion for every

01:13:49.719 --> 01:13:55.679
sort of problem it's a tharion that's that word that means

01:13:55.679 --> 01:14:02.040
to enchant to enchant yeah and they're

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.800
using it in order to they're saying we're able to change a mental state for

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:13.840
example towards um sexual drive right you can change that with the

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:20.480
right drugs you can so the person the model for ancient medicine I'll end with

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:26.199
this um then we'll take some questions the model for ancient medicine is that

01:14:26.199 --> 01:14:33.800
the person has a natural disposition and that differs um between

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.920
all individuals there is no drug one that is going to

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:45.440
treat all of those different individuals doesn't work like that the fact is every

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:53.400
individual is different and by understanding your particular

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:59.080
composition you can and balance yourself with what is in your

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:06.840
environment so it's a very different model of medicine it's very it's very old uh very Bronze Age and it relies

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:15.639
almost exclusively on an in-depth knowledge of uh plants and animal products is drugs uh good for human use

01:15:15.639 --> 01:15:23.480
yeah thank you very much for coming today um I appreciate it very much and I'm G to put I'm just going to ask

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:29.600
anybody want to ask any question let's see um anybody from maybe from Down

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:35.000
Under everybody satanic congregation nice I don't mean to to turn you know

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.440
turn you away but does anybody have any right now let me just explain right now

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:45.560
you can go on the chat that we have here and you can post a question if you're

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:50.880
curious about something or you want to follow up on anything just give me a

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:57.560
thank you Edward thank you Edward I appreciate it um that's the approach that newer medicine is taking look at

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:04.480
this somebody thank you Dr Al you're welcome that um do that one it says that's the approach yeah where'd it go

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:10.360
oh it disappeared look at that that's the approach that newer medicine is taking well that's interesting I hope it

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:16.159
is I hope it is Neo prototype I hope it is because I think there's a lot of

01:16:16.159 --> 01:16:23.000
valuable stuff there that we kind of we kind of dropped you know um in the Middle Ages kind of dropped and Let It

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:29.840
Go by the wayside I think we're behind a little a little bit we can't end without any mention of Mark

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:36.880
145 yeah what is that Mark 1451 and 52 says Jesus Christ was arrested in a

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:44.040
public park at 400 a.m. with a naked boy screaming I am not a child trafficker um

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:51.040
that's what the Greek says check it out go to the next one why do you think scientists are bringing back these old

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:58.000
recipes oh yeah no I've actually talked um I've talked with a couple of

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:06.440
biochemists now um three actually three yeah and there's an interest of course

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:12.040
in novel sources of Novel drugs I think that's what it is mostly but the

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:19.040
approach and every person that I've talked to um the approach has always been what's the one thing that's going

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:25.560
to you know we're going to stud we're going to find one drug and we're going to study that one drug and what it does

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:31.080
the body and that's going to be our drug it's a very one-dimensional approach and

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:37.719
um scientists are going and Physicians are going to have to get used to a new

01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:43.320
model if they if they're ever G to embrace what the Greeks were doing

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:50.040
they're gonna have you you're going to have to um change the way you think

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:58.360
about medicine being a one drug straight One Direction Vector to a cure um that

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:05.320
it's life is not like that um and what can you do though with our capacity now

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:13.120
right what can you do except take one of these formulas and hash out what all the

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:19.639
chemistry is in each of those plants but if I've got 45 ing gradients you know

01:18:19.639 --> 01:18:25.440
and this is what biochemists say to me um you know it's too much it's overload

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:34.679
right it's overload there's so much that can be going on you'd have to I had one tell me you'd have to make a a model AI

01:18:34.679 --> 01:18:42.159
an AI it was Hamilton I think it was Hamilton you'd have to make construct an AI that would be able to break down what

01:18:42.159 --> 01:18:49.560
every drug is doing and how not only that but you got to have what it's doing in the body and I know for a fact th

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:55.520
just those interactions alone I can't imagine with our level of tech being able to track that

01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.679
um yeah it's just it's information overload it was much better when the

01:19:00.679 --> 01:19:06.760
knowledge of how to do that was um was

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:13.080
cified by religious groups yeah religious slash Physicians slash

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:21.880
remember the Temple of esus with the serpent on it right our symbol of medicine um that's all a cult that's not

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:29.639
that's not you know ancient um John's Hopkins right it's a it's a cult

01:19:29.639 --> 01:19:35.199
let's go um question could we cover the counterfeit drugs more I think it would

01:19:35.199 --> 01:19:42.639
be interesting to understand how they grifted in comparison for the real deal that's a great question Carrie that's a

01:19:42.639 --> 01:19:48.239
great question um yeah gayen warns us he says you get

01:19:48.239 --> 01:19:53.320
adulterations and it will change he said you can tell from the color you can tell

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:58.360
from the texture you can tell from The Taste whether or not something's been

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:03.960
adulterated and he even says in some cases he says hey um this stuff that

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:09.120
they're trying to Pawn off is lynian is not right you notice it doesn't have the

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:17.120
seal and the colors a little bit off um so people are trying to to um adulterate

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:23.400
drugs obviously for the same reason they do now right if you can take um a cheap

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:30.199
substance and put it into um your drug as a substitute um you're going to

01:20:30.199 --> 01:20:36.880
because you're going to be you know making more coin um but uh gayen says

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:44.320
it's it's it become a huge problem so the response of doctors um and seals

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:50.760
that that's an entire it's a mechanism to keep the drugs legitimate it's almost

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:57.679
like a an old FDA or something right um when when when this drug has my stamp on

01:20:57.679 --> 01:21:05.560
it you know that I produce quality material right Dr Andreas sucks don't go

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:11.920
to him right right um but this other guy is great right gaylen's always talking

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:18.600
about these Physicians all the time so notice can you notice that the Physicians are a lot

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:24.280
more uh well-rounded well-rounded in Antiquity I

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:30.920
don't know this science of geology I don't know the Metallurgy I don't know

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:37.280
the you know um X Y and Z about die formation and Morant how do you use

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:43.560
Morant to fix the dyes and what does that do um to the entire drug the

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:50.000
doctors in Antiquity are having to have this working active understanding of

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:55.040
plants and animal substances and dirts and spits and urine

01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:00.199
right can you imagine that after after a long day of traveling and you know

01:22:00.199 --> 01:22:05.400
Finding buying 20,000 these pills and got to get them got to get them back to

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:13.199
the marketplace and you know now you've got patience you got to drink their urine it's it's a tough life you know

01:22:13.199 --> 01:22:18.320
sounds like a tough life is there anything interesting in the Greek text of

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:23.679
Leviticus that's that's of course it's all interesting right it's all

01:22:23.679 --> 01:22:30.679
interesting um uh you know you can talk about the oils that are used in the preparation

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:36.360
for the priesthood the of the tent you know they call that tent in Greek the

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:43.080
testerian right what is testerian it's an oracular um place that you can capture

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:50.520
the voice of a god very Pagan very Pagan but they're using the same um they're using this not

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:57.239
only the same uh plants um but also you know when Moses is holding up the

01:22:57.239 --> 01:23:03.960
serpent back in Exodus there's a reason there's a reason remember those Priests

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:09.800
of hesus who are that unquenchable

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:15.840
fire right they hold up the snake they hold up the snake right the

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:21.480
Egyptians know about the craft as well right they do they have their own traditions and to be honest their

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:27.639
medical Traditions suck compared to the Greek the Hebrews Papyrus is garbage compared to the Greek and it's not it's

01:23:27.639 --> 01:23:35.360
not because you know the people were not smart the Egyptians were dummies or anything um it's a fact that um the

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:40.920
language that they use is hindering their capacity for abstract thinking and

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:48.000
the Greek language um encouraged it and uh just whipped the garbage out of every

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:54.760
other language in the mediterran Marcus aelius the Roman Emperor is writing in Greek he's writing in Greek he taking

01:23:54.760 --> 01:24:02.080
his Greek thec and he's writing in Greek and people are like look he looks so handsome powerful yeah he's a drugie

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:08.840
he's a junkie people and galen's complaining about having given more opium all the time yes go to how about

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:14.320
can we go to modern day limnos and try to recreate the medicine I'd say that

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:21.000
would be worth a shot ion I would I'd say that that would be um and you know

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.760
somebody somebody is g to be in trapped and try to go all the way you know you

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:35.520
know it'll probably be somebody who sees the positive benefit right I mean imagine this thing supposedly you know

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:41.600
if we have the purple and we can supposedly treat

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:47.480
tumors um wouldn't we want access at least to analyze this stuff and see what's going on I don't know it seems

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:54.960
like a seems like a no-brainer I'll catch you guys I thought we'd go this summer um but no it didn't work out

01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:02.800
greed one boo let's go to the next one um when did gayen live second century

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:09.679
anod Domin during the reign of Marcus aelius and a little bit thereafter yeah

01:25:09.679 --> 01:25:14.840
he was comus is physician too he kind thought kedus was a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah love it

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:21.360
go to the next one go to the okay give me one comment here here how about yeah

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:27.280
oh look at that I know someone oh I know someone who tried to suck the

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:33.400
venom out of a snake bite of a child are they a vampire my God

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:38.880
man um are they a vampire um yeah uh

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.960
speaking of vampires that's a very Greek thing that's a it right draon the order

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:52.400
of the Dragon is a great concept right draon what is that draon um yeah uh

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:58.480
that's that power that that guardianship um and the funny thing is

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:03.520
when you are listen this is what I I find is neat maybe is there an medical

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:11.679
application for this I don't know but medically it's interesting to think about when I am on that wave of the

01:26:11.679 --> 01:26:20.679
communion and I've had the drug I've had the thec and I had with it the um thoy

01:26:20.679 --> 01:26:28.080
the death inducers that death State inducer um when I've got those drugs on

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:33.400
board um I get a thirst for blood and a

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:38.520
taste for flesh I get a thirst for blood and a taste for

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:43.920
flesh uh I've seen rights that use um

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:50.400
baby blood I've seen it um um they were Christian sex I was

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:57.400
looking at early Christian sex um and the stuff that they did there's a lot of stuff going on man um and you can never

01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:03.199
draw a line between what's the religion and what's the what's the medicine yep

01:27:03.199 --> 01:27:12.440
okay I think we'll call it um Cerberus get that off there get that get off

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:18.840
thank satanic congregation thank you for that thank you for that thank you for

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:26.639
showing up um to all of uh to all of our friends in Australia um who are looking

01:27:26.639 --> 01:27:34.360
at modern medicine and its approaches as being insufficient um I think those and

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:40.920
those professional physicians in Antiquity those midwives all of those pharmacologists I think they would say

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:47.360
the same thing I think they would look at us and say what a simplistic stupid approach it's probably their language

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:52.639
set Anglo saxing garbage probably um thank you very much for coming tonight
