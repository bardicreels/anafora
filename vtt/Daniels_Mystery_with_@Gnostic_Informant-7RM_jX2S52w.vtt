take a step from representing Pirates Who were

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:59.279
dealers in the purple trying to take that extra step to

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:05.160
what the Greeks called polus city state that's what we call it

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:11.000

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:38.279
the followers of Abram what they were doing what kind of

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:44.279
people were these we're going to do this backwards right because that's the way the devil always says to do it you do it

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:52.839
backwards right it's much more efficient this is Luke 16:24 yeah and he says oh who is this

00:13:52.839 --> 00:14:01.040
doesn't matter he says Father Abraham have mercy on me send over

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:08.839
Lazarus in order that he might dip the tips of his

00:14:08.839 --> 00:14:14.079
fingers and some water sprinkl it on my

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:19.639

remember what Abraham was doing last week we found the flocks in Greek

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:36.800
right here it is here it is what is the

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:44.040
flocks it is that flame if you knew the purple you would

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:53.680

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.480

third Century Alexandria what is the big thing in Alexandria

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:04.440
exactly what he's talking about this is pidea right for Unix in Babylon and he's

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:11.440
using the same terms he's using the exact same terms why because he's reflecting what

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:20.800
is in his environment and he's trying to broadcast it to the Past isn't that

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:26.319
interesting some people wrote straight up histories people like

00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:32.160

cultures these are languages what this is what they do that kind of thing some

00:40:38.319 --> 00:40:43.560
people wrote pseudo

00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:51.680
histories but the problem is when you do that your own fingerprint is going to linguistically work its way through and

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:58.720
you're going to get caught eventually and that's what we've got

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:05.480

00:57:32.119 --> 00:57:37.799
realize how much of what you thought was quote unquote Old Testament or Torah

00:57:37.799 --> 00:57:43.960
what is actually the septu agent how much of this are or cult terms that

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:50.400
we're coming across frequently in the Greek sources that predate this by

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:55.839
centuries right and postdated by centuries right it's gorgeous give me

00:57:55.839 --> 00:58:03.599
the next one give me the next one okay I want to read this one um so Daniel answered in the face of the of the King

00:58:03.599 --> 00:58:10.760
right Daniel steps up because King starts killing people oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you can't tell my dreams frig it you're gonna die

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:18.839
right I mean that's I don't know maybe he's on something but um I don't know sounds like alucino or something um and

00:58:18.839 --> 00:58:26.799
so what happens what happens he says he's he he's been given the musterion

00:58:26.799 --> 00:58:33.960
yeah right it's the musterion that he's looking for which is the

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:42.880
answer to his question of what was my dream Daniel understands because he is

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:48.400
initiated he's using the language right here in the

00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:03.599
that we're looking for in Greek here's the word that we're looking for in Greek okay muston and its concept how are we

00:59:03.599 --> 00:59:09.640
going to translate that into um dead Hebrew from the first century BC when

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:15.480
we're all sitting in Coman being zealots hanging out not going into cities and

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:21.240
stuff because we're zealots and we're going to create we're going to create some Hebrew

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:29.000
that hasn't been around for hundreds of years so what are we going to do with this word oh man you know the Greeks

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:38.440
what are we going to do with this one what do we do what do we do with it oh look at this Raz Raz tell me what is the meaning Raz

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:45.599
is a secret Raz is a secret look what they did they spoke do you know there's

00:59:45.599 --> 00:59:50.880
no secret what are you talking about a secret look at the word origin

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:56.960
Aramaic or right does it say or no a foreign origin right it sounds like a

00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:06.520
lot of possibility and probability sounds to me like you you created this word Ras from

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:13.000
Mysterion sounds to me that's like what you did because the meaning you'll never be able to the depths of this one you

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.359
won't be able to go look at the verb that comes from muo muo right

01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:26.839
mystery secret right do you see this doesn't mean secret this is the secret

01:00:26.839 --> 01:00:33.960
right the mystery is a performance it's a performance did you

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:41.160
forget about bakas and all of that theater and all that good stuff look at this first appears in

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:47.760
heraclitus Nice Nice presocratic references to it Herodotus talks about

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.839
it right we talk about the kabiri and Samra and what they're do we talk about

01:00:52.839 --> 01:00:59.760
demer lusus what else what else of these things that Daniel is talking about he's

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:06.280
talking about Mystic implements do you remember the Musta that we

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:13.599
took when we captured those pirates and then took all of their children the

01:01:13.599 --> 01:01:20.119
young goodlooking boys that didn't like you know have ears that were different

01:01:20.119 --> 01:01:26.880
places you know and looks nice those we took those and we clip clip clip clip

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:33.240
took off their little testicles we are working with the

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:39.720
Musta do you know why you are circumcised at this time you are

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:46.559
circumcised because you were part of a gang of pirates who were

01:01:46.559 --> 01:01:52.880
involved in sex trafficking that is why you are

01:01:52.880 --> 01:02:02.558
circumcised it has everything to do with your sexuality and how it will be

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:10.839
sold did we get that through I think that's what we need they load that one

01:02:10.839 --> 01:02:17.880
up and whole thing's going to go off yeah I love it let's go back do did we

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:23.200
miss anything up here I just want to make sure we didn't miss anything up here go back to this one go back to this

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:29.920
one um yeah this is more what is I want you to notice third from the bottom line this where we're talking about the

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.119
muston all right this is Daniel we're talking about the muston and this m

01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:41.838
these Musta are going to be revealed right and

01:02:46.079 --> 01:02:52.359
he oh back um look at the escaton quick quick quick third line from the bottom

01:02:52.359 --> 01:02:58.640
the escaton what is it people that's where we get our word escaton ology from again another word you're not going to

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:05.440
be able to represent this in Hebrew right it's too sophisticated right and so they don't keep going keep going

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:11.799
let's see next one next one yeah that one yeah you're right that one um no on

01:03:11.799 --> 01:03:17.559
underneath that underneath that underneath that boom um no escaton here

01:03:17.559 --> 01:03:23.000
oh God wait a minute wait a minute this is good stuff though look here's a little here's a little mystery here's a

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.160
little more mystery look at it the remedy is my secret my secret remedy is

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:34.559
a medicine it's in Gaya Alexander traes at the very bottom there my secret

01:03:34.559 --> 01:03:40.960
medicine is it a secret no it's a drug combo that we're using in

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:47.200
religious rights yeah these are the implements that you can

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:54.240
take if you're Nebuchadnezzar did you know what happened to this King by the way anybody know what happened to this

01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:00.520
King he loses

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:07.200
it he loses it bro I tell you don't trust those Magi I told you stay away

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:14.039
from the Magi for now right you got to be careful they're gonna be offering you stuff next thing you know you're GNA be

01:04:14.039 --> 01:04:19.400
out you know and doing crazy things doing crazy things absolutely you know

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:26.039
come on where's Nero Nero Nero has to be fed people that he can fight with that's

01:04:26.039 --> 01:04:31.279
where we're going right give me the next one give me um no it's this one it's this

01:04:31.279 --> 01:04:37.760
one mystical truth right what is that escaton what is that escaton that we're

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:45.160
talking about what is it give it to me in Hebrew how do we translate that in Hebrew well it's the

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:51.720
end the end again word origin probably Aramaic

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:59.920
maybe from this word we don't know because now these languages ever wrote

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:06.200
anything seriously they didn't no they had been so dominated by the Greek that

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:11.599
there was no literature right there is absolutely no literature when you people

01:05:11.599 --> 01:05:17.240
and they look at you funny when you say hey outside of the septu agent um where

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:23.640
are the Hebrew medical manuals they don't exist I'm sorry where

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:31.000
are the Hebrew lyric poets don't exist I'm sorry right they have to be backtracked

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.920
into history they have to be placed back in history and that is what the story of

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:45.920
the translation of the septu is all about it is an attempt to seed history

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:52.640
with things that were not why to justify to justify what well in a lot of

01:05:52.640 --> 01:06:02.520
cases if you get to know the prophets you'll find this out in a lot of cases it's genocide monism gravitates to

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:10.119
genocide right monism gravitates to genocide okay okay that's why you don't

01:06:10.119 --> 01:06:17.039
see resistance to it right that's why monism doesn't actively strive to resist

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:22.599
the Giants that would just come in and destroy a village do you know any of

01:06:22.599 --> 01:06:30.760
these Giants I knew one that went into a village with some special fire from uranos and

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:37.599
blew up a building where Anastasia's father was and killed him and then left

01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:43.119
the countryside left everything just just

01:06:43.119 --> 01:06:48.279
rubble a giant destroying the world the

01:06:48.279 --> 01:06:54.640
tyrants have been Unleashed I think that's what the the the Watchers were saying something about that that's what

01:06:54.640 --> 01:07:00.000
it was about I wish I could remember they're going to be so mad if I get back and I didn't do that um something about

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.400
tyrants you love the tyrants uh something along

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:10.680
those watch them rise blah blah blah I don't know I'll have to go they always

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:18.400
you know they try to keep it simple but it's distracting give me the next one we're GNA go um what is the escaton

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:24.119
right look at this it's space as always in Homer the furthest the uttermost the

01:07:24.119 --> 01:07:31.760
extreme okay give me the next one I'm starting to get it I'm starting to get it it's the extreme

01:07:58.079 --> 01:08:04.520
okay we're going to Breeze through this we're going to Breeze through this because my internet is failing as you

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:10.160
can obviously see and then we're going to get to Neil um the escaton is something special I just want you to

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:17.400
realize that and you can't convey it in the Hebrew it doesn't come across look at this the logic of Aristotle right

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:22.798
what are the what are those things that are esotic they're the lowest

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:29.318
species right look at the bottom the automon what does that mean right when he says species he doesn't just mean

01:08:29.319 --> 01:08:35.040
like we think species right um the automon there is

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:42.120
atomism right there these Greeks are talking about the atomic theory and you think oh democratus is the first to talk

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:48.880
about it oh great look what Aristotle is doing this is the power of their language give me the next one give me

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:55.880
the next one in it's the last step in geometrical analysis or ultimate it's called the ultimate look at it

01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.520
expression below

01:09:02.279 --> 01:09:08.359
right right it is that final

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:16.359
condition right of the deed the thing that's being practiced of the action itself right the ultimate condition of

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:23.960
action final step okay look how they're look how they're you know how they're tuning these words right and these are

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:29.798
in the text but the Hebrew can't he Hebrew just can't bear that burden right

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:35.600
so seeing I'm translating seeing him what is this he fell at his feet and he

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:40.758
starts talking to him he says saying a lot of stuff but he says look I've got

01:09:40.759 --> 01:09:51.920
Aug I've got a little girl who's es she has or is in a state that is the

01:09:52.199 --> 01:09:59.560
escos it is that extremity would you please understand this is

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:06.600
where we go in the mystery this is where we go and that's

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:12.120
why it's showing up in Daniel because it is part of the mystery

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:21.199
as he himself said we've got the boys we've got them

01:10:21.199 --> 01:10:26.719
castrated we've got their supplements going

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:34.640
what more of the mystery do you want do you want don't ask me should we do this

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:42.080
right is this I'm I I feel funny I feel strange no just stop and watch the

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:49.360
anthropology and yeah it hurts it hurts my brain too but this is the

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:57.400
reality that's behind the fairy tale yeah yeah love it and it's it's

01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:04.040
quite revealing about history give me one more text we'll Buzz through these cuz I want to get to Neil I got that

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:10.120

lestone what is a grotto it's a place where you go if you are a child

01:11:54.520 --> 01:12:01.400
trafficker who is involved in the mystery you see the circumcision is the

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:06.440
sign in the flesh do you understand why the boys now

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:12.920

Unix get your clothesman ready it's going to be a long night it's going to

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:10.960

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:18.159
going on I just wanted you to see that Daniel is great he's great with the dreams but I want you to look here I

01:13:18.159 --> 01:13:25.239
want you to look here this is verse 13 we're talking about the salvation the

01:13:25.239 --> 01:13:30.600
salvation of the people and the T soai the Salvation or the saving or

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:37.639
preserving of what tonist sue your Christ do you see who we worship you

01:13:37.639 --> 01:13:42.679
Christians and you you um practicing Jew

01:13:42.679 --> 01:13:50.440
Jews right which by the way I've been in Israel and most of the people that I was around were like openly hostyle to

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:56.719
practicing any sort of freaking religion especially when we're walking in the synagogues women that we had worked with

01:13:56.719 --> 01:14:05.040
all week couldn't fraking be around us anymore right that monism drives to the

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:11.080
Tyranny that is ultimately misogynistic I think it maybe it was that was that

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:18.440
with the Watchers a bunch of misogynists right bunch of misogynists you're rooting for the Giants people why are

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:25.199
you rooting for the Giants they're going to destroy everything give me the next one give me the next one um yeah here's

01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:33.120
your MOS I just want to leave you with the MOs and you can come back and see this but okay and finally our last one

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:40.400
then I'm gonna bring on Neil I'm gonna bring on Neil what's that seed of the king oh

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.560
this is right before I was going to include this before this is just when he's taking hostages and collecting

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:52.679
Daniel okay what I want you to see from tonight's work is that the world is very

01:14:52.679 --> 01:14:59.199
different and you and I can can get a view of the 3D Century's world

01:14:59.199 --> 01:15:06.600
through the fictional craftsmanship of the author of Daniel

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:13.360
now and remember please in Antiquity they were arguing they were arguing people

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:21.159
say no the people who actually read what was in Alexandria said there's

01:15:21.159 --> 01:15:27.719
no way this thing is is original Hebrew there's no way it is this thing is Greek originally for all

01:15:27.719 --> 01:15:34.880
the very same reasons I'm pointing out to you the vocabulary that they couldn't keep up with right

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:40.080
um it's epic taking a step from gilgames

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:48.639
up to hmer is an epic jump it's an epic jump yeah it is and I

01:15:48.639 --> 01:15:53.719
think people are beginning to see that people are looking now and focusing on

01:15:53.719 --> 01:16:01.320
the Greek and the socalled sepian scholars who aren't really septan Scholars those are Hebrew language

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:08.440
Scholars right they're not Scholars of the sepagan if they were and they had read anything outside

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:15.679
of the septu agent they wouldn't be saying what they're saying it's just the same thing that um africanist said so

01:16:15.679 --> 01:16:22.040
with that I want to leave you tonight and I want you to be thinking about I mean I'm not gonna leave you I'm gonna

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:29.440
interview Neil now this we're gonna do this differently but before we jump in with Neil I just want you to know we're

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:36.080

the world of these quote unquote Pirates right these nonpol azed nations right

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:50.880
these groups of people I mean it's not the first time in history they had migrating groups of people wandering

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:09.719
totally agree agre on that I think Aristotle would would say yeah that's definitely true yeah I think anybody

01:20:09.719 --> 01:20:15.159
with brains would tell you the very same thing you know um I think it's good that

01:20:15.159 --> 01:20:21.960
you get out of the concrete for a while and get out to the get out to the mother nature so you found a nice place that'll

cross over it'll bring you the nature and that's awesome that's awesome fantastic okay I want to ask you this

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:36.080
you had a video you had a video that you did um do you want to talk about your video at all because you know ask me

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:42.320
anything you want man ask okay fantastic fantastic look what are you doing when

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:50.679
you create a video like that are you engaging in what the Romans did when

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:56.960
they made public demonstrations for doctors are you engaging in the museum

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:02.600
what tell tell us about it CU people are going to be harsh on you and they're going to say oh you shouldn't be so you

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:08.719
shouldn't be so critical with the Bible that's what a lot of people are saying that I was it was too much I was too

01:21:08.719 --> 01:21:14.080
mean it was it was an ad hom blah blah blah blah blah when the same people do

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:20.000
the same thing to everyone else you know when when they when they do a rebuttal against you know some apologist that

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:27.239
they don't like they think he's a misogynist or whatever they think he's a liar they think he's wrong they'll the same they're engaged in the same

01:21:27.239 --> 01:21:33.000
rhetoric that I look Cicero talked about it Aristotle talked about it Damas

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.239
talked about it there's a style of rhetoric sometimes a little adom here and there goes a long way with with a

01:21:38.239 --> 01:21:45.320
good argument an Adam without a good argument doesn't look good A little ad ham with a good argument that's a you

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:51.520
know that's a nice spicy tomato right there I I thought it was more than just

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:57.040
a it was more than just a street fight because you brought out so many

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:04.320
sources um there there's no way that any you can ever get a response to this

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:12.920
because you just brought out sources and just showed people you just stuck to the facts and showed people and I think um

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:18.199
the people who want to obscure the history who want to obfuscate those

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:24.159
people I think they don't know how to handle you Neil when all you're doing is bringing them sources I don't know what

01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:30.679
do you think that's what I was trying to do I'm trying to demonstrate take people by the hand show you the sources show

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:37.239
you give let you see it for yourself let you decide and then even bring in a couple other PE you know I brought in

01:22:37.239 --> 01:22:43.880
Paul paw larente at the end a scholar who write wrote dissertation on James Frasier and dying and Rising Gods who's

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:49.440
a current Professor who's publishing books every month and articles every

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:56.040
month on these things like I'm just I'm saying look there there are people who specialize in these things there people

01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:02.920
who don't so I'm trying to point that out to people and then there's the primary sources that that's that's uh

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:09.520
king of all the primary sources are king of all Scholars are great but the primary sources are King you can't argue

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:17.280
with the primary sources if it's there it's there if it's not it's not that's why I went straight to um um diodorus of

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:23.000
Sicily euphorion of culus and um what was the other primary source that oh

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:29.159
cicus I say look if you don't know for first of all you can't pronounce semily right get out of

01:23:29.159 --> 01:23:34.440
here you're in the wrong you're in the wrong room go back to grade school but but all right let's let's let him pass

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:40.400
let's let them all right you screwed up it was it might have been a mistake all right fine if you don't know the central

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:47.280
mythology of Dian Isis as being a god him and Osiris gods of Resurrection

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:54.560
that's their theme that's their whole purpose that's what they that's what they're there for that's what the orphic tablets present is that the hope and D

01:23:54.560 --> 01:24:00.360
isis's Resurrection is the Hope in your own Resurrection it's the Mysteries right that's why they find golden orphic

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:06.080
tablets all over the Mediterranean not just in Macedonia not just in thce not

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:12.639
just in Central Greece not in Italy in cre in Egypt and then from the 3 Century

01:24:12.639 --> 01:24:20.400
bcee all the way through the fifth century ad there's hundreds of Golden Leaves

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:26.120
orphic Golden Leaves From and burial sites in Israel

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:33.480
so you can't say this is the Greeks over there and this is the Jews over here no no no orphism was a was an international

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:39.760
religion of the ancient world it was an international cult that the that people

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:46.480
in Latin participated in people in Greek participated people in Aramaic Syriac Egyptian they were all participating in

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:54.719
orphism orphism was widespread and so I wanted to point that out to people like look this stuff was big the idea of you

01:24:54.719 --> 01:25:00.560
even you know know you get in um in some of these orphic oric uh fragments there

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:07.920
is sort of a hint at original sin and the Titans who eat the Flesh of baby

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:13.880
dionisis zagas as euphorion calls him he just get says his name is dianis zarus

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:21.719
one name um they eat his flesh in a sacrifice and they consume his flesh and

01:25:21.719 --> 01:25:27.440
Zeus is so angry at this that he takes he K first of all he kills

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.840
them all then he takes their flesh who after them consuming the body of

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:38.600
dionisis have this spark of divinity in them and he creates the world out of it

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:45.679
and because of the world because the world's created out of the Titan flesh humans as a result have a Divine spark

01:25:45.679 --> 01:25:55.719
in them Dian Isis and also sort of an a a um sort of a sin fleshly uh uh you

01:25:55.719 --> 01:26:04.080
know what's the word uh a tit a Titanic cannibalism right so the idea of the the

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:10.320
idea of you know of eating the eating the fruit right which causes sin and

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:15.600
enter the world in the sepagan in the Old Testament right they're eating zagas

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:21.400
who's a fruit God think about that so there's something going on there there something something interesting going on

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:27.560
there you also have the diad of Zoe and Adin indestructible life that's Zoe that's

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:33.320
zagas so I don't know I'm pointing all this stuff out I didn't go that deep in the video but I did think I I did think

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:39.679
I actually laid out that it's pretty clear how influential the the oric dionan bakic

01:26:39.679 --> 01:26:46.440
myth mythology is on the wider Mediterranean world all day all day

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:51.920
I and don't forget that the um the literary

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:58.280
tradition carries with it the idea idea that bakic religion swept across the

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:06.400
world they're getting it in thieves and it's hitting in people the whole the whole story is about why people won't

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:13.159
accept it and then when they come to accept it how they're forced to do so and it's sweeping every the longest epic

01:27:13.159 --> 01:27:21.239
in of Greek is about a war of bakic religion spreading all the way to India

01:27:21.239 --> 01:27:30.400
right so post posid of Roads when he traveled to India he noticed how similar the sh

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:37.400
shiism was to B bak bak to the orphism to how Shiva was like he called him he

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:43.520
called Shiva an Indian dianis yeah and and there's there are some Scholars

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:50.239
um France kumant I think it's France kumant who P who uh points out that

01:27:50.239 --> 01:27:57.560
Shiva and sabazius had AR cognate through this Indo European word SOA SWA

01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:04.600
which is where we get sabba and Shiva from they just go in different directions and it's the caucus the

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:11.040
caucuses region where he says this probably came from from vit culture because that's where by the way and it

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:17.320
actually lines up maps on perfectly Vita culture was discovered in the Caucasus region that's where they that's where

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:23.159
they learn how to cultivate the vine and make sasus is from there does it lines

01:28:23.159 --> 01:28:28.679
up that evidence I think that's I think there's some strong stuff to say people probably people will probably argue is

01:28:28.679 --> 01:28:34.840
the Greek coming from the Sanskrit is sanskrit from the Greek I think they're both coming those common roots from that

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.880
palasan ancestry you were reading something about palasan the other day what' you find

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:45.280
out oh yeah the pans that's what the Greeks called their ancestors yeah there

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:55.320
was something about some writing somewhere that somebody was thought what it's what it's what Scholars refer to as Indo European it's that yeah European I

01:28:55.320 --> 01:29:02.000
don't ter no one likes that term I don't know why I don't care what you call it I just it is it is what it is um but you

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:08.119
know what I want to say this too orus Orpheus was claimed as a Prophet by

01:29:08.119 --> 01:29:16.920
the Jews living in Alexandria we have like three or four primary sources of claiming that orus either was the son of

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:23.400
or the teacher of museus who they thought was Moses I'm not making this up

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:28.679
read James Charlesworth is uh um pseudepigrapha it's right in there it's

01:29:28.679 --> 01:29:35.800
in the book two go to go to the Ora read what he says they claimed orus as their Prophet not only that we talk everyone

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:41.800
talks about apocalyptic literature right that's like that's oh Jew Jewish Jewish

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:48.400
uh texts are apocalyptic in nature apocalyptic nature that's Judaism right well what was what is Orpheus doing he's

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:54.280
called a theologian the first time anyone's ever called a theologian is Orpheus

01:29:54.280 --> 01:30:00.360
uh and that goes back to the Classical period not the helenistic period and also he's he's revealing use they use

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:08.320
the word apocalypse he's revealing mysteries about catastrophic events in the future about the gods a God the gods

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:14.199
you know coming down and enacting Justice it's apocalyptic

01:30:14.199 --> 01:30:20.360
literature it's what you generate when you're christed baby and um that's what

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:26.800
they're doing it's the F that they're doing by the third century when said tuag is being produced it's down to a

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:34.119
very specific he's teaching him the mystery and they're using the acrs to do it and it is a vision and this is the

01:30:34.119 --> 01:30:40.840
vision you realize those Visions is the same thing the oracles and the prophets are doing and they're all using drugs to

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:46.960
get there right do you know that the word God in English is it cognate with

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:53.480
gota which is also cognate with Soma and ha it's a drug it's cognate with drugs

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:58.520
the word God the English word for God is incognate with

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:06.679
drugs so that leads me to think that there's in the in the origins of religion itself there was there was um

01:31:06.679 --> 01:31:11.719
ordained Priestly psychedelic use whe whether it be you know cannabis use in

01:31:11.719 --> 01:31:18.400
the temple whether it be drinking Som or haom or kukan or some sort of drink some

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:24.239
sort of some sort of thec some that's and I think over time it gets we e it

01:31:24.239 --> 01:31:30.880
out and it just gets relegated to certain groups and then eventually Christianity as the church as the Roman

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:37.440
Church takes over they sort of corporatize religion and they sort of water it all down and it doesn't we know

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:43.560
religion is no longer what it used to be in the ancient world they took people actually met the gods and had real

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:48.679
Revelations using psychedelics right and they took that out it was one of the

01:31:48.679 --> 01:31:57.760
Christian control mechanisms is removing that from society so now you in in in uh

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:04.119
in a way you then control the god experience that those drugs naturally

01:32:04.119 --> 01:32:10.480
would bring out so it's like taking away religion monism takes away the natural

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:17.560
religion that is you know coming through us to us through the poisons and the plants and the you know everything love

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:23.960
it love it that's why I brought that's why I brought up that Source um because Danny Jones asked you

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:30.400
about ask Danny or ask Dan about this you know you talking about how there's drugs in the beginning of Christianity

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:35.760
he's basically saying there's there's just no sources that reflect that that's why I brought up that Source from

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:42.880
hippius talking about Marcus and like some people might say that's only one guy who cares but then it's like wait a

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:49.280
minute though Marcus was a valentinian a huge sect of Christianity

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:56.800
going into the middle beginning to the middle of the second century 120s 13s 140s around that period huge group of

01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:03.159
Christians in the West in Rome and in France the marosan brought Christianity

01:33:03.159 --> 01:33:08.440
to France and they're named after this guy they're named after this guy the guy

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:14.119
that got caught slipping drugs in the Eucharist giving it to women so that they can prophecy and do all this crazy

01:33:14.119 --> 01:33:20.400
civil civil it's like civil stuff you know and so I pointed that out like look

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:26.400
he's calling it a heresy but this is 50 years later this is no it's actually longer I think

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:31.480
hippius writes around 220 or something and he's writing about a guy who's like

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:36.880
6070 years ago he don't know what was going on back then he's just you know so

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:43.520
I think I think at the time go ahead why would you want to be stopping

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:48.840
people from entering ecstatic States why would you want to be stopping people

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:56.199
from using drugs is it a control part of me thinks it's an attempt to take that

01:33:56.199 --> 01:34:01.840
Vision all to yourself and control it which in that case makes sense because

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:07.520
the secret Gospel of Mark he still got his boy and he's staying with his boy

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:12.719
and he's doing what is obviously sexual things it says they're entering into

01:34:12.719 --> 01:34:19.000
love it says the kid was sexually attracted to him wh uh what I thought

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.040
about this yeah go ahead the the major Schism that happens in the first or

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:30.239
second century actually part I think I think it probably started in the first century the very first Schism of

01:34:30.239 --> 01:34:36.360
Christianity ever it's not the Schism of Orthodoxy and Catholicism that happens

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:43.639
centuries centuries later it's not the uh Schism over the Trinity Aryan the Aryan heresy it's not that it's the

01:34:43.639 --> 01:34:51.280
Schism of divine revelation versus Bishop Authority and they called the people who

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:56.320
were getting divine revelation Marcus is one of them drug use is an example they

01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:02.440
call those people gnostics they just wave a blanket term over all of them they didn't all call themselves gnostics

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:08.440
some of them might have I think there's some evidence that the nasin call themselves gnostics cool we can agree

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:14.239
with that they didn't not call themselves that they're all different valentinians aren't the same as the nines the the carpar crans aren't the

01:35:14.239 --> 01:35:20.280
same as the valentinians the sethians aren't the same as the nines either they're all different they're all doing their own thing they're all Christians

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:26.280
though they're all calling themselves Christiano now the Schism happens between two

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:35.080
different groups of people it's not gnostics and Orthodoxy this is what it is Bishop Authority versus personal

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:41.159
divine revelation they don't want people to be able to say I've gotten divine

01:35:41.159 --> 01:35:48.199
revelation and this is what I was told by the angel or God or whoever by Jesus or Mary whatever they don't want that

01:35:48.199 --> 01:35:54.560
because that's too much chaos you can't control that you can't corporatize that imagine if you're a corporate

01:35:54.560 --> 01:36:00.320
McDonald's and everybody all the McDonald's um franchisees they're all

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:07.360
just doing their own thing selling their own products one of them sells chicken the other one sells Burger the other one sells you can't have that they all have

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.560
to be in uniform and they all have to follow who who's on top bishopi

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:17.679
authority the Bishops rule the Bishops decide the Bishops determine things like

01:36:17.679 --> 01:36:24.840
Christmas and Easter whatever but that was what the Schism was those people were fighting for personal divine

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:31.840
revelation and they call them gnostics but that's not what they were it's just the freedom to express religion in an

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.679
narcistic way and to be connected to God by yourself they didn't want that that's

01:36:37.679 --> 01:36:44.159
what they ruled out in the first second century that's what became the Gnostic heresy that's that and that's why you

01:36:44.159 --> 01:36:49.360
get people like hippius and irenaeus and Justin Martyr writing about these older

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:56.400
sects that are gone and they can't defend themselves and and we're we're Orthodox and they're not that's what

01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:01.440
happened it it makes you wonder it makes you wonder if they're

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:06.960
all practicing the mystery right it's the central element that they're all

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:14.800
supposedly involved in directly if I can go to the carpo creations and I

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:23.520
can ingest the priestess's um body fluids in order

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:29.440
order to have my communion that will take me to that place where I can see

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:37.679
that Living Dead Girl and then come back um why would I submit to an Episcopal or

01:37:37.679 --> 01:37:43.080
or a bishop Authority right I it makes me

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:49.400
wonder what did that the what did those Bishops ultimately

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:55.000
do that quash the activities of of those

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:02.119
other Mysteries that were harnessing the chemical and the sexual communion I

01:38:02.119 --> 01:38:07.960
wonder what what do you think they did eventually they just start killing people or something yeah there it's

01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:13.520
power they want the power I mean that's so that's just human nature is to strive

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:20.280
for more power the will to power it's everyone has that in them and that's what happened with these Orthodoxy these

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:27.280
Bishops who are wanted to get just want control over this over this church and it fits better for a Roman imperial

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:34.440
system to have one church with one one Creed one dogma and all the cities you

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:40.840
know have one text that they read one Bible and they don't have no na document

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:47.400
no no Gospel of Thomas no it's all just what we think is the is the correct or

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:54.560
which was word orthodox means the correct straight way right yeah what about the Unix do you like the way I

01:38:54.560 --> 01:39:01.800
mean Jesus is walking around giving out his death inducing drug um and he's

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:11.760
being christed um he's casting out the demons um how is it that um we dropped

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:18.040
the whole unic thing because he was big on the Unix he was telling everybody look if you can be a unic for the kingom

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:23.400
of heaven so one of the things I've been noticing about about how we can make

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:30.159
inferences from from texts that tell us stuff about other things for example when heraclitus talks about how he's

01:39:30.159 --> 01:39:35.679
disgusted at the Dian religion how they worship idols and he says how they they

01:39:35.679 --> 01:39:42.239
wash themselves in blood he says they purified themselves as in blood as if it's cleaning them and that's what we

01:39:42.239 --> 01:39:50.599
can infer from that that the dionan religion at the time of heraclitus in the six Century BCE presocratic times

01:39:50.599 --> 01:39:56.560
Classical period we can infer from his text that the dionan Cults were doing

01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:02.400
some sort of ritual where they were being washed in the blood of dianis just like just like you're W he was

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:08.239
represented by a bull in some cases sometimes a goat depends on what text we're looking at or what whatever but

01:40:08.239 --> 01:40:14.199
he's the ritual sacrificial animal which is what you get with Jesus is the Lamb because he's the Passover Lamb but what

01:40:14.199 --> 01:40:20.880
I'm getting at is you can infer things right you can infer from that that's how you don't have to find a a you don't

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:27.159
have to find in the Bak eye some sort of reference to them being washed in the blood of dianis you can go to heraclitus

01:40:27.159 --> 01:40:32.599
and do a cross reference and infer from that there's got why would heraclitus make that up right all right that's one

01:40:32.599 --> 01:40:42.119
thing in the second century the nasen preacher told his cult members to go and

01:40:42.119 --> 01:40:47.159
watch the mysteries of Addis because he told them you will see

01:40:47.159 --> 01:40:55.599
your own mystery of Christ within the mysteries of Addis this is what he says to them he says I I I um I'm

01:40:55.599 --> 01:41:01.520
paraphrasing but he says I encourage my my my followers to go and visit the the

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:07.000
the hararia go and watch the Holy Week and and you'll see your own mystery of

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.119
Christ within the mysteries of Addis now he even has a whole hymn dedicated to

01:41:12.119 --> 01:41:18.599
Addis that he applies to Jesus and it's very syncretic where he's calling him Osiris he's calling him dianis he's

01:41:18.599 --> 01:41:24.960
calling him bakus he's calling him Addis Adonis all that stuff but the reason why I'm bring that up is because you brought

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:33.119
the unic thing why would he tell his followers to go and watch people become Unix for the king for the for the um for

01:41:33.119 --> 01:41:40.840
the cult of Addis if as if that's that's where you're going to find your mystery in so I can infer from that that in the

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:47.280
early 2 Century Middle 2 Century there were Christians who had a there might

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:53.880
have been something related to people becoming Unix for the Kingdom of Heaven just as Jesus says

01:41:53.880 --> 01:42:01.400
in Matthew right Matthew becoming King Unix for the kingdom of heaven right so

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:06.480
to me making an inference from the noten document from the noten preacher there's

01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:14.040
something there for sure I think it's an integral element

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:20.520
that people you know because they don't read sources like the one that you just brought up right they don't they don't

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:26.360
jump into that and be it's because they want to promote a theology or a

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:34.480
Viewpoint and shame on the biblical Scholars for doing the same thing shame on them for they fall they fall victim

01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:39.800
to the same dogmas that the church wants them to they're un it's like they they

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:45.960
do the same thing even if they're not Christians even if they're atheist Scholars they do this thing where oh the

01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:51.679
not the nines those are Heretics who cares they're not they don't tell us anything about Christianity oh the Corporal crans they don't tell us

01:42:51.679 --> 01:42:57.560
anything about early Christianity why am I there let's look at Justin Martyr let's look at Clement of Rome let's look

01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:04.239
at and it's like why would you only look at who became Orthodoxy four centuries

01:43:04.239 --> 01:43:09.480
later because you're in that camp because you're a monest of that specific

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:15.599
camp and you can't be flexible it's the problem with monest education right

01:43:15.599 --> 01:43:22.679
first thing you do is you go in you destroy all of the sources that aren't your holy source and you plant your holy

01:43:22.679 --> 01:43:27.800
source why you they're doing that schools absolutely right we're so lucky

01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:34.560
to even know about these Heretics we wouldn't know about them we lost all of their Texs they're all gone

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:39.719
we only know about them through people talking crap about them yeah that's it

01:43:39.719 --> 01:43:45.400
yeah that's it and then the nen document that's an interesting story they found

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:53.920
that in um Mount AOS in Greece in some uh some Monk location like just like

01:43:53.920 --> 01:44:00.159
buried in a bunch of text that was just by itself and no one even knew it was there someone stumbled on it it was half

01:44:00.159 --> 01:44:06.360
ripped barely can legible and they they're like what the hell's this and it's about it's this nen preacher

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:11.760
document some crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude yeah about addex Addis and Enix and the great

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:17.560
mother and all this crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and pro probably some Monk wiped his backside

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:23.320
with it you know at one time or another and threw it back into a pile yeah to oh

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:29.280
because it was you know it wasn't the good stuff it wasn't the stuff that's ruled to be the Orthodox I totally agree

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:36.360
with you I totally agree with you okay I want to end on this I want to ask you you've got a an interview coming out

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:43.080
with uh Danny Jones tell me about that and when people you think can can see it

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:49.280
I'm not sure when Danny's gonna drop it uh but it's coming out before it will be out before the election that's for

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:54.960
sure because he wants to we talk about um it's not it's not really Pol political but it's about the founding

01:44:54.960 --> 01:45:01.960
fathers it's about the anacreontic society the star sping remember you and I had a chat about this one time but we

01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:07.719
went 10 times deeper we get into the Statue of Liberty we get into some of

01:45:07.719 --> 01:45:16.719
the stuff that some of the uh Napoleon and the French Revolution and the Enlightenment and the drive the drive to

01:45:16.719 --> 01:45:22.400
go back to classical sources to draw wisdom from and that's what I kind of

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:27.639
hammered way in that podcast was how much you know the founding fathers for

01:45:27.639 --> 01:45:34.080
example they wanted to they wanted to create some sort of system based off of the ideals of the Roman Republic

01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:39.520
Athenian democracy something in between something that can fit the 13 colony

01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:45.280
system that they had going on at the time period and they're like they're looking at the the because at that at

01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:53.000
the time period the Holy Roman Empire still existed for another 10 years I think it was like

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:58.239
some early in the 19th century or 18 yeah 19th century the uh Holy Roman

01:45:58.239 --> 01:46:06.480
Emperor finally Falls because of Napoleon but anyways they're looking at this dying carcass bloated carcass

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:11.800
religious system theocracy where there's an emperor and a pope and they decide

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:18.480
and there's all these different and the Bishops are on top and the Bishops have to go to every city and every every uh

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:24.080
yl or not yl whatever they called them at the time um uh I forgot what they're they're called but they're they're not

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:29.599
they're like Governors right Burgers I think they're called burgers is that yeah yeah yeah every governor in in the

01:46:29.599 --> 01:46:35.679
whole in this in in Europe had a bishop right next to them looking over their shoulder and watching everything they do

01:46:35.679 --> 01:46:41.679
and they're basically like spies that's their job they basically their job is to spy on the governor and

01:46:41.679 --> 01:46:47.719
report back to the to to Rome and say or the you know whoever whoever's in whoever the whoever the powers sources

01:46:47.719 --> 01:46:52.880
at the time whether it's the emperor in Spain or the hasur and over in Austria

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:59.040
ever it is right depending on what time period and their job is to report back and say they're not doing he's being

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:04.679
heretical he's doing some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's acting like a pagan right now we gotta we got to do something about and that's

01:47:04.679 --> 01:47:11.719
and so the United States decided that we don't want that system we want a free system right and so they then set up a

01:47:11.719 --> 01:47:19.520
constitutional republic based off what we found an ancient Roman Republic based off the writings of Cicero and deanes

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:26.920
and Solon and lerus and all these brilliant thinkers of the ancient classical world oh wait let me mention

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:33.080
I'm glad you mentioned like kgus um like kgus by the way in plutar did you notice

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:39.960
that he talks about like Kus set up a system for um education for women just

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:48.360
just for the women because he wanted while people were away campaigning he didn't want stuff to fall fall apart so

01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:55.360
um women's education was mandatory and Plutarch says it was heavily driven by a

01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:02.199
gymnastic a physical component as well as a working what we would call an

01:48:02.199 --> 01:48:07.679
educational component that was strictly not physical I mean it's gorgeous I

01:48:07.679 --> 01:48:12.880
think it uh um Aristotle brags about how we have women in our society who could

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:19.599
think for themselves and they're educated and can can do like they they have they're proud of that yeah you know

01:48:19.599 --> 01:48:25.920
you want that that's there's nothing like so yeah there's there's things that were happening in that time period there

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:34.280
was they're looking at the current times and going what do we need to do to get back to real Society that's that's free

01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:40.239
and and that's and libertas that Goddess that Great Goddess libertas manura you

01:48:40.239 --> 01:48:46.320
know with with the shield and the helmet and the and the and the sword that's the symbol that's the god that rules us you

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:52.960
know yeah the Divine virgin baby of democracy we love it we love it and she

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:58.639
goes back to the serpents she goes back to the serpents and the practice of the

01:48:58.639 --> 01:49:04.400
musterion so that that mystery is extremely important throughout history

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:11.520
and I'm proud to say just like you were saying you know culus is the area where

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:17.040
you know you're G to get this cultivation that's gonna push bonic

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:23.639
religion across the world um I love it I'm always going to tell people par just

01:49:23.639 --> 01:49:30.800
thought that the mes were named after media right right and that she was the author of that bakic religion it would

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:38.119
make sense because the communion can only come through a physical source so

01:49:38.119 --> 01:49:45.040
it would make sense that whatever she did with her brain to figure out what happens and when you consume this what

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:52.199
it does to your body God damn that and that Med that medic Kingdom that medic Kingdom stretched all the way from India

01:49:52.199 --> 01:49:58.040
to the Greek speaking world and then it's ear oh God oh God I love it okay
