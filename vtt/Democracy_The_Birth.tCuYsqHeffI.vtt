week in some popular YouTube

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:57.200

debating and this one Gent

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:10.239
gent this one gentleman said

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:17.359
Christianity created democracy

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:25.840
Christianity is responsible for democracy Now turn your scientific

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.520
clocks 180 degrees because Christianity has

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.560
historically been the degrading force of

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.639
democracy it is like an antidote to a

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:52.960
Venom when you Embrace tyranny and become the servant of the

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:59.639
Savior you kill the drive of democracy I don't want

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:22.600
is on what was the what did democracy really come from because there are many of you out there who may buy in to this

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.560
educational approach to warping reality and think that Christianity was someh

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:38.720
somehow involved in the birth of democracy no no no no just the

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.520

00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:20.000
Watchers is anybody else a little creeped out by that they shouldn't call them Watchers

you know they should call them recorders of events or keepers of time right no no

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:31.839
they call them Watchers what the Watchers make of our goat the reason I

00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:39.160
mention the goat is because this is the mother of democracy and everybody

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:49.560
knows that she nursed a king who was half human half

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.720

I'm making a percentage on that right um we're not talking like that kind of

00:29:17.519 --> 00:29:22.679
divinity we're talking about a Divinity preceding that one that is this mother

00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:27.919
Divinity and she has Justice in her a

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:33.480
AA is the one who brought us Justice you

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:39.120

Justice once you say no to Justice you lose it that's it it's up for grabs yep

00:29:48.279 --> 00:29:53.519
it's just a seed of power now and you are servants to a

00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:59.760
tyrant but Athena for first establishes Justice the

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:05.000
arenes tracking arrestes and he comes to

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.399
Guess Who Athena Apollo is his attorney because he's the one through the Oracle

breaks any tithe in the vote wait you mean their

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.120

democracy seriously do you think it was let's say nuns and monks figured out

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:50.120
democra do you think that they're going to perpetuate a system like that no

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:57.399

feeis Apollo you you're right man you're right you got it right on the head right

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:08.640
this is who we're in the presence of in order to establish

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:14.599
justice now if you wondered why it was a big deal to establish

00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:21.839
justice there are lots of medieval courts but there was no justice right when you burn people alive

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:27.119
for having ideas that are not your own that's exactly what Julie and the AP

00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:33.400
State warned us what happen uhhuh you know they'll burn books right you know

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:39.760
they'll get rid of stuff and they'll rewrite the history right now imagine this is where democracy is coming from

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:46.040
and yet you are being bombarded with the message that

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:54.079
Christianity produces democracy because that's what they're going to do forcefully for us right

00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:59.640
they're going to take ours away and they're going to produce their own and this hellacious Beast will eat us all

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:05.800
but the one thing the Christians are not telling you I almost got to this before the one thing the Christians are not

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:11.119
telling you in their kitchens right now um they're saying

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:18.079
America isn't a part of Prophecy it's for some reason they have you know they

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:25.880
like to divide up plac and say this is so and so and this is so and so and this is so and so right they didn't even know how to read those texts but they do that

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:33.000
and um one of the things they say is America's not America is not in the final days when the glory of Jesus

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.880
Christ returns to fail the horse with the blood up to the shoulder

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:46.040
blades um why why will they tell you America's not there America gets knocked

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:51.240
out seriously so the people are planning

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.720
right now for America to get knocked out who do you think keeps telling you to

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:04.560
invest in bullets and bullets and dried [Laughter]

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:12.520
Goods yeah it's coming people it's such a special year this year is so hot oh

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:20.640
God the events the events makes me I smell it you could

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:28.599
smell it when Rome burned too and they were like those those

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:36.079
they're they're they're just determined to bring to reality their prophecies

00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:41.880
they're just determined to and if their prophecies say they're going to burn down Rome they're going to burn down

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:49.640
Rome their allegiance is not is not to that

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:58.000
fris that somehow those racist slave owning

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.880
Knuckleheads um manag to come up with we don't need to idolize them we don't but

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:10.760
somehow some of them captured some kind of glimmer of some of a reflection from

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:16.680
Antiquity from a woman named Athena and that

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:24.119
drove the freedom that you and I ultimately inherited that we're holding on to it

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:30.319
drove that Thomas Jefferson said and people said don't get political I'm not

00:38:30.319 --> 00:38:36.119
I'm being an American and I can tell you that Thomas Jefferson said straight up

00:38:36.119 --> 00:38:42.480
the greatest threat to the fledgling American democracy is the

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:49.160
Protestant movement yeah known as the Presbyterians at the time that's who it

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:56.720
was you say evangelicals now you can say whatever you want those people who are trying to re

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:04.480
write your history right now just like they did in the 4th Century they're doing the same thing again and if you

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:11.040
don't honor Athena our ancestors they're not going to let us

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:18.599
frakin get anywhere near them do you think that's honor my God

00:39:18.599 --> 00:39:27.800
don't tell about Poli you know what you can do you can take this Greek and you can shove it where the sun don't sh

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:33.599

00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:03.359
Strangler oh God wouldn't you like wait a minute my mind just went there I saw her can

00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:13.839
you imagine this it's the Bronze Age and there are gangs of very powerful

00:41:13.839 --> 00:41:20.839
technologically advanced women who can come into your city turn

00:41:20.839 --> 00:41:27.119
it upside down take anything of value and haul off some of your virgins

00:41:27.119 --> 00:41:34.079
they're so good that they just have to approach the city and say oh you ready to pay up

00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:39.880
right and they are interested in the Oyster

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:45.560
Mania they're the ones whove developed technologically that ability to be able

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:51.880

rues punish these women by the way they're getting sexier and sexier the more we go um I'm sorry but that's just

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:32.760
my opinion um I'm being honest what are they used to the furies how do they

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:38.359
punish these older diones that publish crimes against

00:42:38.359 --> 00:42:43.400
family members these women

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.400
um um it says right

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:54.079
here oh my godu is when you dig out somebody's

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:12.760
the the the power of that but what else are they they're into the Slaughters of

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.920
Justice wait what yeah the just

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:25.599
Slaughter okay just laau okay um I guess if you really you know um if you murder

00:43:51.319 --> 00:43:58.640
the veril of the child child along with these punishments within the earliest

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:05.440
form of Western governance is an element of

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:14.000
Justice woven into the Bronze Age Fabric and what is that Justice directly

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.160
involved with making

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:29.240
Unix it's the kingdom of heaven and they're making Unix some Unix says Jesus are made Unix

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:35.040
for the kingdom of heaven interesting that's what these

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:42.160
women are yep and who stands between us and Them

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:48.440
Athena Athena does what does Athena do let's see the next text you're gonna

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:55.000
love this boom um before we get to what Athena does this is heraa I just want to

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:03.240
give you a sac name of Hera TOA is Her Sacred name what is Hera everybody knows

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:09.720
Hera is the most beautiful everybody knows they know that she is that

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:15.880
guardian of that Union she's what she's guardian of the

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:23.920
Union the guardian of the bed okay okay she's also what TOA she

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:31.559
who was the one who accomp ises the right she is the completion of the right

00:45:31.559 --> 00:45:38.240
because you see the right has something to do with a marriage if you're GNA be a

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:44.280
Christ you got to talk about your bride you got no Christ you got no

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:52.640
bride all right you got a Christ there's a bride somewhere this is ancient mystery

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:59.720
religion heraa is that protective

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:09.079
Dion that protective Dion Athena is just enforcing that what does she do she is

00:46:09.079 --> 00:46:17.079
the transition to what you and I call Justice the murderer is brought to her

00:46:17.079 --> 00:46:23.800
and she casts the deciding vote and her vote is to

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:30.920
quit yeah and what does that enable us to do you can have a city then you can

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:38.400
have a civilization that can advance if you don't have Justice you will not

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:44.520
Advance you will deteriorate you will degrade fantastic love it go to the next

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:50.960

says if you will be well-minded

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:15.720
you will honor them always and establish a

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:22.240
city that follows Justice that's how you

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:27.280
practice from that from the EST establishment of those

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:33.480
courts from the establishment of that Cult of Justice you mean Court was

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:39.000
originally a cult yeah yeah it didn't they didn't build a zigurat next to it

build the courthouse the secular Courthouse they didn't do that you what

about on the other side what about maybe there's some no no it's

00:53:50.799 --> 00:53:57.559
temples temples to Justice if you don't consider Justice holy and this is the

00:53:57.559 --> 00:54:03.799
question this is the present of the future and the past brought together if

00:54:03.799 --> 00:54:15.760
