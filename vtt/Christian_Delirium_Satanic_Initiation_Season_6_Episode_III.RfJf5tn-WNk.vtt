declined the dance of Bacchus oh that's a big mistake if you are in your life and you um

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:22.500
feel the call you should not turn away from it why have you not been reading anything these

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:28.320
bakkens they turned on Orpheus and cut his head off they turned on Orpheus and

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.440
cut his head off right this is our religion people let's get it let's let's see what's going on

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:41.220
um yeah so they declined to dance the cause were of that they desired to have husbands and therefore would not be mean

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:49.260
as to the God we're at he was incensed of course he was mad and when they were working at their looms and very busy

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:56.100
look at look at 17th century busy who is he yeah boozy boozy and weaving on a

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.940
sudden branches of Ivy and of vines twined about the their looms and dragons

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:09.000
dragons made nests in the back baskets why would they do that

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.940

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:59.220
who's Greek is better than the best is better than the best

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:05.699

this announcement in a fit of prophetic rage

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:12.259
so that you don't have to partake

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:18.000
of that Unstoppable poison

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.020
that induces the fury why

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:30.240
did we go from one Universe to another

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:36.539
he just said he just said this was all what is the

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:41.600
scandalizing how is he translating the scandalizing

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:48.000
you don't have to enter into the fury

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.220
because he does

00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:00.600
and tonight on the night he gave his flesh and blood on the night he took of

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.820
the cup of the Vine

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:11.899

oysters for us he is assuming the oysters for us

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:33.419

00:19:33.419 --> 00:19:39.000
of intoxication let's look at the next slide please I want you to notice this

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.160

and you see in a bucket with a barking shout

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.419

00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:51.900
state you want to be in folks right in order to become prophetic

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:07.020
um person you have to go through this pathway of

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:14.419

00:33:23.159 --> 00:33:30.600
describing Jesus's mental state is used of pneuma and it says it's with

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:36.360
respect to his soul yeah yeah that place that place of

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:43.559
confusion it wasn't because of a confusion in his soul that he did this what did Newman do he dropped everything

00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:50.700
you people are going to love this you know what this says pneuma left the city behind and all that City Life and he

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:56.820
chose to live out in the Wilds yeah and what did he do he he wandered a lot by

00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:03.179
himself right that's what he wanted to do and he wandered around sacred Groves

00:34:03.179 --> 00:34:09.919
and Meadows and places out in the wilderness he wandered in these places

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:16.260
and what was he doing what was he doing um well in that place this is at least

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:23.480
what they say right the logos what's the logos on it the logos on it is that he

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:29.398
knew o goddess yeah and that he was with that goddess

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:36.720
and what um what what did they do right well we know historically that pneuma took that

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.720
goddess's words put them into Scrolls and those Scrolls

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:49.280

that are in the gospel what I'm saying is you don't know half of them you don't know half of them

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:18.300
is the bridge that will unseal for Our

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:27.599
Generation these sealed books the gospels are sealed until you have

00:44:27.599 --> 00:44:34.260
the cipher you will never know Jesus

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:44.460

me um and everybody who is trying to get closer to the Greek keep it up

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:36.720
keep it up do you see what's sitting there under the text somebody asked me today they said

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:43.200
um do you think that I am Lucas is the most difficult Greek author and I

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:49.800
said no the person I told that to you is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who doesn't read Greek I am because it's about a six

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:57.960
about a six to a seven yeah noness because of his precision

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:03.359
with the vocabulary his grammar is okay and he's having to fit meter so it's a

00:46:03.359 --> 00:46:10.260
little bit slippery but that's okay what's really any can play with the words he can plague at length and vowels

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:16.440
he can shorten vowels but what's really neat is this technical

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:22.220
vocabulary and known us will uncover

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:27.420
exactly what we called the mysteries in

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:33.660
the Gospels yes it's the key to unlock that this season

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:39.660
this sixth season is time to show you the cipher

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:45.540
and to allow you to see with those eyes of the Dragon

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:59.360
