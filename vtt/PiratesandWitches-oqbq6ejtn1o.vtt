nerd from banum right constan

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:01.919
whatever this nerd who's a Byzantine nerd is reading all of this classical

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:09.120
literature what's your name again ustus ustus you know he's I'm leaving

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.199
him alone I'm not you know I'm not being rough with him um he's kind of giving it up here because he loves classical

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:24.440
sources and he has a whole bunch that you and I no longer have you mean he's got quotes from some

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.520
of the greatest minds of antiquity yes we don't have those quotes anymore

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:35.240
because why don't we have those quotes for example aist starus talks about the

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:42.479
Stars being just like our sun but further away and we actually go

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:47.519

okay it's from Homer and what does it say it says you know now's a good time to question these people and figure out

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:53.440
who they are since you know they ate their meal and they're good and he says oh strangers tell us who you are where'

00:17:53.440 --> 00:18:00.320
you come from sailing over the sea and you know what kind of thing do you do you got have business or do you just

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:07.159
roam marauding like those pirates you know what they

00:18:07.159 --> 00:18:15.760
do they traffic in Souls look at that bottom line they traffic in Souls it's

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:24.559
such an terrible thing they bring to their neighbors oh God you mean are we back to

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:31.080

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.440
not a pirate what are they doing they're trafficking they're trafficking in

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:42.240
people tell us Aus give us a little more information you remember Jesus when he's

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:49.760
saying I stand at the gate and here I am and my sheep my sheepies hear me I don't

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:57.159
have to be a robber or a lace yeah you mean there's a difference

00:18:57.159 --> 00:19:03.159
