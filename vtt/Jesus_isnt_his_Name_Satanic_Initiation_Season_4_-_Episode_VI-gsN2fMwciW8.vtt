times thank you it'll tell you that bad times were good

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:40.520
and good times were bad it'll tell you that black was white

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.880
you can close the door on the ones you don't like change them around and make

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.900
the wrong right

00:07:54.139 --> 00:08:01.680
but you can't ever trust them to tell the truth and sometimes I like them to

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:10.199
lie and so I remember you

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.099

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:08.040

of RAM yeah yeah it's got a golden Fringe

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:20.820
it's got a golden Fringe we're going to look at it and what all of that means we're going back to the initial

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:26.639
we're going back to the initial mystery right we are squarely where are we

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:34.139
dimensionally dimensionally we're in Libya it's siwa right we're receiving that

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:40.079

00:15:45.899 --> 00:15:53.100
when it was decided that it would be given to him yeah it would be given to him and how do

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:58.380
we get there we have to get there with some kind of force and energy and as

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:03.660
everybody knows that is what that is what runs the universe that's

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:08.880
how magic works right there's a reason that we go to Cyprus

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:17.100
there's a reason because if you don't go to Cyprus if you don't go to Aphrodite none of

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:22.740
your none of what you're doing will get off the ground

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.959

do you know what the difference is linguistically between Jason and Jesus

00:37:37.619 --> 00:37:45.000
they're both titles and you know what the distances between them one vowel

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:54.000
one vowel and we know when it comes to using roots in classical philology the vowels do not

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.599
matter they are what focuses the root

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:06.180
Continental root you can tune you can tune with the vowels the

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:12.000
difference between Jason and Jesus is a dialectical difference it's the

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.440
drift of the Greek over time it's exactly what he should be called right you didn't realize that he also

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:25.859
was a goddess some of you are into the more esoteric

00:38:25.859 --> 00:38:32.579
content of antiquity so bro you already knew that right you're looking at that healer

00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:38.220

police has a golden Edge yeah what is that fleece called

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:33.359
the original name for that fleece that pindar gives us isn't just the product of

00:45:33.359 --> 00:45:42.180
fleecing it's not just text Iles right he calls it the bedding

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:49.500

bedding oh and it's used of the Golden Fleece

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:31.859
yeah and what has happens on that Golden Fleece we know that what's written on it

00:46:31.859 --> 00:46:36.900
is her song and if that song is in an ink

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:43.140
that contains something called The Burning purple and we know that there is a communion

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:48.839
that is shared between the two on the fleece

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:55.880
on the fleece and how does he come out of it well because of what Aphrodite gave him

00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:02.540
he doesn't get burned up he gets his courage and he gets his

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:08.220
capacity to go out fulfill what she needs to be done

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:17.339

I just want to kind of get to to the end tonight through the fire

00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:41.640
you know the fire did not touch him the fire did not affect him

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:49.880
says pindar why because of the genius

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:55.680
of Medea The Genius of Medea because of the

00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.440
genius of Medea

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:07.380
she who knows all drugs in Antiquity

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:13.800
they'll call you a Fatima case that's just a witch right it's just a witch you

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:20.339
know drugs okay you know I'm better than your average Joe and you're involved in meetings

00:48:20.339 --> 00:48:25.800
yeah meetings where you worship Aphrodite we know you guys we know you

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:32.460
guys get you know their sacrifices we know that you're involved with making

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:41.940
eunuchs we know that you're involved in sexual performance that is drug inspired we

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:48.720
know that we no problem with that right um but what we're interested in looking

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:54.119
at is where did you guys get all this stuff right where is this mystery operation

00:48:54.119 --> 00:49:01.400
coming from it goes right back up that River fossus for those of you who knows the Adam

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:09.180
reference that is the place the paradise where the Ewa where she who shouts bark

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:17.160
us that's where she is right it was our serpent didn't belong to them

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:23.280
right appropriation is appropriation but goes back deep all the way through

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:29.240
the pulaskians love it that EPO

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:34.980
ah and thanks to the palm pharmacon

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:42.480
what is that that's the highest that's the height linguistically the highest level that we have recorded for the

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:49.260
witch who knows the drugs you got your thoughtama case or your Fatima chaos and

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:56.520
you have depending on where you're from and you have your um you have your Polo Pharma con

00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:03.839
the the state of knowing many drugs which is a step above that regular witch

00:50:03.839 --> 00:50:08.990
you better watch out for her she's doing stuff like castrating people and you know

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:15.060
[Music] you know for what lack of a better word is you know experimentation

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:20.819
you know a lot of psychedelic stuff we don't have her anymore right we don't have that polypharmacon anymore

00:50:20.819 --> 00:50:28.800
we don't have but there's one step above that and that's the palm pharmacon

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:38.640
that's that root pan that's everything I she is the witch that is the witchiest

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:45.859
yeah because that word for which doesn't come from that terrible Anglo-Saxon whatever that is

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:51.720
sounds like the guy had a stroke or something right

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:57.599
um no it's the farmak root the root it's the drugs

00:50:57.599 --> 00:51:02.640
this is the drugs fantastic and here's the here it is skilled null charms

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:10.140
notice that the only reference we're going to have is the Medea right okay and despite this despite the fact that

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:19.980
she had the reputation as being the most advanced and ancient drug use and ritual

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:27.780
um despite this sh um uh she

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:34.200
still shined as a genius right even though even though we see it

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:40.700
in the context it's very foreign to us you can feel the radiation from Medea's

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:47.359
discoveries is what I'm trying to say This Woman This Woman was a genius a

00:51:47.359 --> 00:51:54.359
hands down and Incredibly skilled this is Lady Babylon right this is Lady

00:51:54.359 --> 00:52:01.559
Babylon which she was the queen of right and the founder of the medes and all you

00:52:01.559 --> 00:52:06.720
percies all you people call yourselves Persians right it was a royal line that

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:13.319
came through caucus on the Black Sea you realize that right right okay

00:52:13.319 --> 00:52:19.140
so yeah get your bearings there Magi get him in where was that word that meant

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:25.260
Chaldean remember one of our words was with the Chaldeans right we can't lose track of these people

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:31.980
these are all nations and tongues right assembled together so that the

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:38.339
abomination of the edemosis can be seen in the temple again

00:52:38.339 --> 00:52:44.819
