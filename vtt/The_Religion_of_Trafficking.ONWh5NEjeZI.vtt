interference so buckle up I've got some

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:05.039
great material for you and I want to say

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:08.319
thank you for your time before we start

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:12.319
tonight's Friday night hooa this is

gorgeous is better the Muse um I'd like

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.760
to say we're going to tread a little

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.239
softly tonight I feel that you need a

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.519
little a little bit of beauty a little

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:28.640
bit of break from the heaviness

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.560
heaviness oh don't get me wrong don't

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.800
get me wrong we still have to go into

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.080
combat we have to defend these

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.280
sources we have to defend these sources

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.560
so I'm going to bring you some more but

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.560
for you who are really drawn by the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.879
power of mother Greek for those of you

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.640
who are really drawn by that power and

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:58.319
when I talk about power I'm not talking

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.040
about ugic with and with how big is your

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.120
vocabulary

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.200
you got

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:09.879
Jack you got Jack let's all put this in

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.879
perspective open your

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:27.680
ear it's okay we blasted him never mind

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.680
ah open your ears

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.680
mother Greek

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.799
Beyond reaches

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.159
Beyond just take this one fact when

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.319
somebody walks up to you and they want

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:47.319
definitive scientific proof of what I am

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.879
saying about the beauty of ancient Greek

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.319
you tell them one thing there's an

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.239
ancient Greek

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.480
Lexicon lexicon people is a dictionary

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:01.360
but for dead

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:05.480
languages yeah there is an ancient Greek

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.239
lexicon and what does this lexicon tell

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:13.959
us it's written by a dude who's trying

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:16.720
to capture all of the odd words in

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.680
Greek Alpha through

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.600
Omega did you

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.400
know there are more

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.880
words in

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.960
Alpha more words in Alpha

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.400
alone in a

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.360
lexicon of odd words so let me rephrase

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.039
that there are more odd

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.320
words that start with

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:49.520
Alpha in ancient Greek then there are

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:53.600
all the words in many

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.199
languages including

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.080
Hebrew

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:01.840
Hebrew

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.400
yes yes now what I have been explaining

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.840
to people and this is people want this

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.919
idea before we hit the sources tonight

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.600
I'm going to give this to you um people

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:17.039
want to understand how is it that the

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.199
Hebrew cannot be the original in this

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:22.759
the in the septu agent that it's the

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:28.120
Greek is not a translation just like

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:31.759
African is said how must that

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:35.039
be because of the second law of

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:38.360
Thermodynamics oh God this just got so

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:40.440
sexy I'm going to get up my whip I'm

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.319
gonna find Einstein where did you go

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.880
Einstein give me some of this who should

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:50.160
I get people Newton ask the ask the

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.520
who's the thermodynamic jock oh come

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.880
here come here we'll just we'll take it

00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:01.280
out on Einstein come here oh god listen

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:04.560
to it listen to how sexy see this is

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.560
ready second law of

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.520
Thermodynamics over

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:21.199
time your existence Works to the pit of

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:24.080
entropy any system loses its

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:26.120
energy this the work that you could have

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.960
produced is not

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.240
conserved it's

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.800
lost and you

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.880
are a drift

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.240
toward complete

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.240
dissolution total

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:49.039
nonsense now

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.039
that is a principle of physics for

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:57.919
nerds language behaves the very same

00:06:54.479 --> 00:07:00.680
way now when you

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:01.680
translate the ACT

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.759
of

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:10.759
translation results in the loss of

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:10.759
information you ask any

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:18.639
translator translation is never one to

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.639
one it's never

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:24.360
100% there are things that can't be

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:28.479
conveyed in

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.720
Translation you lose a percentage of

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:34.759
your energy that would have gone to work

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:39.680
now it goes to

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:44.080
oblivian you have two text are you

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:46.800
ready you have two texts one is in Greek

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.879
and one is in Hebrew and you have to

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.759
determine which one of those texts is

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:53.759
the original and which one is the

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.319
translation you have to be a physicist

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:07.240
when you

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:09.039
look line by line by line of the Greek

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.280
that in Antiquity they said this is not

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:14.840
a translation of Hebrew this is original

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.080
Greek line by line by line and add up

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:20.440
the

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.960
energy it is far far higher than when

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.000
you add up the

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.879
Hebrew the greatest example of that most

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.240
simple example of that is in the

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:33.560
beginning God created

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.880
uros

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.279
GA and what

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:42.519
happened what

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:45.320
happened on the Hebrew side we have toou

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:46.320
woho emptiness and emptiness based on

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.640
one

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.320
root W is just

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.040
end

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.959
right based on the same route emptiness

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.640
and

00:08:54.959 --> 00:09:00.800
emptiness right what do we have on the

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:03.279
Greek side that score not so High not so

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.800
high do you see that the potential that

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:08.600
it takes to produce that result not so

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:12.519
high what is it on the Greek side it's

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:16.279
off the level it's off the God look at

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:19.480
her beauty look up

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:19.480
those oh

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:30.279
somebody oh what does that

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.920
mean

00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:36.279
unseen

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.279
unseen and unscaffolded

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:43.640
unprepped we're talking about

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:46.200
transition physics

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.920
transition materials

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.880
transition okay how can we do that in

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:56.000
the Greek because we have the ability

00:09:51.880 --> 00:10:00.120
because mother Greek is so sexy so sexy

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.880
you can't do that with 7,000 words all

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:05.519
you can spit out is fraking Inky dooo

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:09.320
and let me tell you something if you

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:12.120
like Inky Doo you can go get

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.640
bananana you can go get bananana when I

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.959
worked for the University I I didn't

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.720
dare say something like that I didn't

00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:23.079
dare let me tell you something you

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.519
morons the Greeks are getting it through

00:10:23.079 --> 00:10:31.360
pans they're calal

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:33.279
lithic they're preor garbage your

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.320
languages they

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:37.519
stink they

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.079
stink they stink do you know what they

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:41.720
are they're the ugly offs scorings of

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:44.440
all the

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.600
daughters Greek stepped forward and took

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:50.680
the first

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.680
prize why look at her ugly

00:10:53.160 --> 00:11:01.120
sisters sometimes you have to speak what

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.120
is what is accurate

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:05.959
love it don't you love it oh God that's

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:36.679
parentheses you see that F looking thing

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:40.200
it's on the front of the word ethnos in

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:43.679
Greek that's the dama oh God that's the

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:47.200

baby this word goes back go this Bronze

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:52.000
Age stuff we're talking about look it's

00:34:48.599 --> 00:34:54.480
already around by Homer certainly right

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.839
talk about athletic clubs you know as

00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:03.599
well as a nation or a people right a

00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:05.960
Province right oh a cast a cast right so

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:07.320
I need you to realize that what Plato

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:11.400
just said in his

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:14.520
Republic was that those are ethnicities

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:17.240
your lastic

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:21.680
identification right that's not a that's

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:24.720
not a that's not a racial thing it is a

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:27.920
lastic it's people who are involved in

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.240
the business

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.320
getting

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:34.680
phation yeah did you know what getting

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.760
phation means it doesn't just mean

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:42.470
trading it means you the

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:45.520
purple you the purple and your

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.520
[Music]

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.760
student okay okay that's an

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:58.520
ethnicity

00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:02.319
yep right

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:04.119
okay remember the when Jesus so and why

00:36:02.319 --> 00:36:06.480
is this so special people why would I

00:36:04.119 --> 00:36:09.000
bring you this because it's special and

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.920
why is it special because when Jesus

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.640
says in the Garden of Gethsemane he

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:16.599
being as he's being arrested with naked

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:22.440
kid he

00:36:16.599 --> 00:36:22.440
says I am not this

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:29.319
ethnicity okay yeah I thought we were

00:36:26.839 --> 00:36:33.040
all made up races and the Pirates were

00:36:29.319 --> 00:36:37.359
like a no no no no

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:40.200
no right the Pirates are the

00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:43.920
ethnicity um blame it on Plato man I

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:47.240
don't care right but um this will help

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:49.440
you to understand why people like ustus

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.560
much later are saying you know I read

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.839
the Greek he's a Christian right and he

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.960
says you know I read the Greek

00:36:52.839 --> 00:36:58.680
historians and the Greek historians say

00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:02.800
that um all of the early Greek were

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:06.640
pirates right that that was the that was

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.640
the um

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:13.319
ethnicity interesting it makes sense

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.200
then that Abraham is a pirate if tacitus

00:37:13.319 --> 00:37:21.280
is right and the what we call mistakenly

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:23.680
called um Jewish people right that

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:26.400
they're if they're migrants from CRE

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:28.119
then they are part of the same lastic

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.599
group

00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:34.839
all right so it's it's it's important to

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:36.760
be able to track that history through

00:37:34.839 --> 00:37:39.040
the language and that's exactly what

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:41.520
we're doing and we're using sources that

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.119
are crowded around that first century so

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:46.520
that everybody sees the overlap with the

00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:48.160
Bible first and second centuries at the

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.480
very same time the Bible is being

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:54.359
written there's another guy writing

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:58.440
about Ley and how bad they are and here

00:37:54.359 --> 00:38:03.359
here's one example right oh

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:06.280
it's gorgeous it's gorgeous um yeah you

00:38:03.359 --> 00:38:08.440
have to remember history is a discipline

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:11.800
right it's a Greek discipline

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:15.119
hisor it really means inquiry inquiry

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:19.079
isn't that isn't that gorgeous

00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:24.359
question a question what is

00:38:19.079 --> 00:38:24.359
Historia it's a question that you ask an

00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:29.400
oracle okay hit us with a source hit us

00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:31.240
with The Source they have everybody in

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.520
satanic congregation is like yeah yeah

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.160
yeah we know that give it to me we got

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:37.400
new people though people that need to

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:39.560
catch up give me the next one new

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.400
material here I give you new material

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.000
you're G to love it okay guess what this

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.200
is something you've never seen I

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.839
guarantee it and this is something that

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:50.839
nobody has ever brought to you I

00:38:47.839 --> 00:38:54.760
guarantee what is this this is the 25th

00:38:50.839 --> 00:38:56.880
chapter of job you mean it's only five

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.560
or six verses long yeah it is it's

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:01.800
really short

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:05.119
it's really short and there's a

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:07.920
problem there's one problem the

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:10.319
Greek says beautiful stuff that makes

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.319
perfect

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.280
sense the

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:19.359
Hebrew is Twisted to say something

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:21.200
completely

00:39:19.359 --> 00:39:24.599
different in

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:30.000
order and you say What's the difference

00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:30.000
remember the Greek has more more

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:35.200
information more information higher

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:39.520
capacity in the language higher

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:41.480
technical capacity more information

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.359
conveyed

wanted to change this right doesn't

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:46.359
paint a historically complimentary

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:49.200
picture does it and as the Romans

00:43:46.359 --> 00:43:51.640
themselves said um

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.400
propaganda right that letter of AR Estus

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:56.520
and all that BS about the translation

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.040
from Hebrew of the septu and then Romans

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:02.559
said that was BS at the time they were

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:04.880
like nice nice why don't you go Josephus

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:05.920
yourself right because Josephus what is

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.119
that

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:13.079
propaganda right it doesn't exist ask

00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:15.760
yourself people ask yourself please why

00:44:13.079 --> 00:44:17.680
is it that there are more odd words in

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:20.280
the first letter of the Greek alphabet

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:23.640
than the entire Hebrew alphabet it's

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.599
because it is not a living language it

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:28.720
is

00:44:24.599 --> 00:44:32.559
revived it is revived from a very very

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:35.020
primitive form by some dudes in

00:44:32.559 --> 00:44:36.200
caves trying to bring the end of the

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:38.480
[Music]

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:42.319
world trying to bring the end of the

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:44.800
world wait a minute did I just feel is

00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:48.720
this I feel something strange this is a

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:52.640
strange emotion great is so sexy

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:56.359
okay get that off get that off of there

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:58.800
what are he doing um that's because

00:44:56.359 --> 00:45:01.119
there's a lot of of aspirations right

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:03.359
there's a lot of aspirations it's very

00:45:01.119 --> 00:45:05.079
windy and that's probably not how it was

00:45:03.359 --> 00:45:08.040
originally spoken anyway right they

00:45:05.079 --> 00:45:10.000
don't know right it's difficult look

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.240
even with as much documentation as we've

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.839
got from the Greek people will debate

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.400
all the time about

00:45:13.839 --> 00:45:19.240
pronunciation right so you know that's

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:23.040
the way it is that's the way it is the

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:24.760
Greek said it sounded like um oh by the

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:27.640
way give me that ethnos oh we missed

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:30.280
something the Greek said it sounded

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:32.040
not Hebrew specifically but every other

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:35.720
language that wasn't Greek was

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:38.079
non-musical and terrible give me um

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:41.640
where did the definition where' the

00:45:38.079 --> 00:45:45.400
definition of ethnos go here I think

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:48.440
it's no no no no no we're way we're

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:50.240
above that above that go up here boom

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.800
there it is people I want you to notice

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.960
you've heard of the division of the

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:58.200
world into Jew and

00:45:53.960 --> 00:46:01.280
Gentile did you know that's made up

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:05.359
yeah that's made up

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:06.280
why because the division that everybody

00:46:05.359 --> 00:46:08.319
is

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:11.160
using is

Greek and

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.800
dummy that's what they're doing that's

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.400
what they're doing it's terrible and

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.839
what's happening to the Greek language

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.920
at this time by the way Greek grows so

00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:25.160
large she gets

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:28.559
adulterated she gets adulterated and

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:31.839
she presents in the this terrible ugly

00:46:28.559 --> 00:46:34.559
form I'm sorry mother the Greek terrible

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:39.359
ugly form called

00:46:34.559 --> 00:46:41.160
coin god god it's the common language do

00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:44.640
you know what happens to your vocabulary

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:46.280
level when you make your language the

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.559
common language because you see there's

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:52.440
a there's a key that I maybe I haven't

00:46:49.559 --> 00:46:53.400
told you yet but this is consistent

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:56.359
through

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.839
history right civilization is the

00:46:56.359 --> 00:47:01.440
product of of

00:46:57.839 --> 00:47:04.880
language civilization is the product of

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:07.420
language and the advanced language

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.480
produces the advanced

[Music]

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:13.319
civilization right if you don't have

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.680
words like education you're not going to

00:47:13.319 --> 00:47:16.359

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:20.280

00:49:07.119 --> 00:49:11.359
happens when he turns the moon dark now

00:49:08.839 --> 00:49:14.000
remember this is a standard operation on

00:49:11.359 --> 00:49:16.720
the Greek side right the Greece are

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.079
doing this all the time right now you

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:23.200
tell me do you think the Hebrew has this

00:49:20.079 --> 00:49:25.040
Hightech in it no of course it doesn't

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:27.319
of course it

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:30.640
doesn't right there's even a

00:49:27.319 --> 00:49:33.520
technicality to sapria and

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:36.400
skolik that there's no way they could

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:38.839
even that that information was lost in

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:41.559
translation right it's Lost in

00:49:38.839 --> 00:49:44.359
Translation the original is way more

00:49:41.559 --> 00:49:46.000
beautiful right because you've taken

00:49:44.359 --> 00:49:49.400
this and you've tried to stick it into

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.640
7,000 words and that's why they were

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:55.720
saying an Antiquity uh no this is not a

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:57.559
translation so here we go here we go and

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:07.760
of it I know I've got translations

00:50:05.119 --> 00:50:10.319

maketh peace in his high places well

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:27.200
that's you can hear that reflected in

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.240
there is there any n number of his

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.960
armies what where did he get armies and

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:35.319
upon whom do not his light arise that's

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:37.880
not there how then can man be justified

00:50:35.319 --> 00:50:41.000
with God that is totally not there or

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:43.640

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.040
woman oh look what they did instead of

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.559

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:50.280
performing right in instead of now we're

00:50:48.559 --> 00:50:54.520
not talking now we're just talking about

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:57.160
the glory of this wonderful lastic God

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:59.559
right so we've converted we've converted

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:02.160
the meaning we're not going now to the

00:50:59.559 --> 00:51:05.799
what is he doing about the moon behold

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:08.760
even to the moon and it shineth not it's

00:51:05.799 --> 00:51:11.319
not what it says yay the stars are not

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:13.559
pure in his sight who is it that they're

00:51:11.319 --> 00:51:15.920
not pure in the sight of in the sight of

00:51:13.559 --> 00:51:19.599
God right you can see what's happening

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:23.400
in this passage more than any other

00:51:19.599 --> 00:51:27.599
passage you can see how the Hebrew is

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:29.400
struggling to maintain a a believable

00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:34.440
level of

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:38.559
tech right and yet not

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:40.280
represent the religious mystery that's

00:51:38.559 --> 00:51:43.920
being conveyed in the

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:46.119
Greek right why are they tampering why

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:48.559
are they tampering the editors is it are

00:51:46.119 --> 00:51:50.119
they the only editors ever to tamper

00:51:48.559 --> 00:51:54.480
with

00:51:50.119 --> 00:51:57.920
texts no no

00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:00.559
no right it's an unfor forunate reality

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.240
of antiquity as long as we've had books

00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:06.200
and Scrolls

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:09.920
baby right people will

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:11.359
tamper they will tamper you can pass

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:14.319
something I've seen people try to pass

00:52:11.359 --> 00:52:17.040
off just forge an entire work of some

00:52:14.319 --> 00:52:18.880
genius right and everybody reads it like

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:21.240
an Aristotle or a galin they're always

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:22.680
trying to forge Aristotle and gayen and

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.160
you read it and you're like no this

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:27.040

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:30.160
dummy right you cannot

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:33.960
capture that genius you can't it's

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:36.440
impossible oh God it's romantic almost I

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:38.880

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:44.799
goodies here's another translation I

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.640
just want dominion and Fear With God he

00:52:44.799 --> 00:52:49.200
makes peace in his high heaven is there

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:51.400
any number to his armies I don't know

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:54.400
where they why they fabricated the arms

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:57.920
upon whom does his light not oh God what

00:52:54.400 --> 00:53:00.720
is this behold even the Moon is not

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:03.079
bright what what is that look what they

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:05.040
did they took something that was

00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:07.480
technical that has to do with the

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:10.559
religious ritual and they turned it into

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:15.480
a metaphor even the face of the moon is

00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:17.440
in as bright as our holy Jehovah

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:22.839
[Applause]

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:26.839
Hashem okay it's a step up from gilgames

00:53:22.839 --> 00:53:29.240
it's a step up you know it it require

00:53:26.839 --> 00:53:32.599
forging things requires a certain

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:35.680
intellectual skill but let me tell you

00:53:32.599 --> 00:53:39.319
something compared to the original Greek

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:41.799
this is

00:53:39.319 --> 00:53:45.680
trash it's a

00:53:41.799 --> 00:53:48.000
forgery forgery and the original the

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.640
original is so much better let's we need

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.160
to take back the Bible I think we

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:54.240
already did I think we already did I got

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:57.799
the red book what did the devil say red

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:57.799
book Bible

00:53:58.839 --> 00:54:05.040

00:54:01.119 --> 00:54:07.400

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:18.640

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.079
watch oh God I can't do this one do the

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.280
next one do the next one right one more

00:54:21.079 --> 00:54:26.520
why did I put all these on there then

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:28.799
answered build a Dominion

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:30.599

00:54:30.599 --> 00:54:35.040
in the end totally loses it then tell me

00:54:33.319 --> 00:54:38.079
how a person can be right how can

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:40.359
someone be born of a woman in blood be

00:54:38.079 --> 00:54:43.400
pure if even the Moon is not bright

00:54:40.359 --> 00:54:46.280
enough and the light of the stars is not

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:47.760
pure in his estimation look what it did

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:50.640
right it's like the translators were

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:52.720
playing some kind of tennis or something

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:55.319
with the reality you know what it's

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:58.119
that's good it'll get it's it's within a

00:54:55.319 --> 00:55:00.960
box it's within a square look look how

00:54:58.119 --> 00:55:03.480
they interpret it differently now you're

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:07.799
sitting there reading this and you think

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:11.079
you've read the Bible before and you

00:55:07.799 --> 00:55:13.880
haven't and that I want to pull out and

00:55:11.079 --> 00:55:16.880
give us a give us chewy some beautiful

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:19.359
imagery while I say something here that

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:25.319
I think is important

00:55:19.359 --> 00:55:26.839
um we need to not give any ground the

00:55:25.319 --> 00:55:28.160
reality

00:55:26.839 --> 00:55:31.119
is in the

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:32.799
evidence and all we need to do we don't

00:55:31.119 --> 00:55:36.640
need to believe anything we don't need

00:55:32.799 --> 00:55:40.680
to follow a you know any path you know

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:41.440
there's no left and right right there's

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:44.839
just

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:47.440
being and as beings we need to

00:55:44.839 --> 00:55:49.720
protect

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:55.720
those bits of

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:58.160
history of humanity and the mind right

00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:01.599
and the beauty of the world we need to

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:03.280
preserve that and that is in these texts

00:56:01.599 --> 00:56:07.480
and you just don't know because you're

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:11.520
not reading it right you're not reading

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:14.839
it and hopefully we're on a pathway to

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:17.760
reading it and having it impact so that

00:56:14.839 --> 00:56:19.680
they can't take it away from us again

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:22.839
they can't take it away from

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:24.799
us what is the

00:56:22.839 --> 00:56:28.119
real

00:56:24.799 --> 00:56:30.559
power of classical

00:56:28.119 --> 00:56:33.079
philology the real power of classical

00:56:30.559 --> 00:56:35.640
philology is

00:56:33.079 --> 00:56:39.280
knowing that put her back up there is

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:41.960

surge storm surge yeah amazing

01:07:56.119 --> 01:08:02.119
um but I saw it on a Danny Jones Show

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:05.119
and the response is well it's okay if

01:08:02.119 --> 01:08:07.799
Muhammad you know had uh one of these

01:08:05.119 --> 01:08:10.319
child Brides right it's okay because

01:08:07.799 --> 01:08:11.799
everybody did it like that and by the

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:14.359
way you know the Christians were doing

01:08:11.799 --> 01:08:15.159
that kind of stuff too right that's not

01:08:14.359 --> 01:08:18.239
an

01:08:15.159 --> 01:08:20.159
excuse and you say so this people who

01:08:18.239 --> 01:08:22.600
step forward and say what about the

01:08:20.159 --> 01:08:24.520
pagans yeah what about the pagans did

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.239
you know those oracles have to be

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:28.080
virgins

01:08:26.239 --> 01:08:30.199
did you know there's all sorts of

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:33.080
accounts of people losing their

01:08:30.199 --> 01:08:35.319
priesthoods because they lost their

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:38.679
virginity did you know that did you know

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:41.159
they would bury the vessels alive who

01:08:38.679 --> 01:08:42.159
lost their virginity these are women who

01:08:41.159 --> 01:08:45.080
were

01:08:42.159 --> 01:08:47.080
sacran you couldn't touch them you

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:50.719
couldn't impede their

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:54.520
Carriage right but if they got

01:08:50.719 --> 01:08:58.880
pregnant that's it you bury them right

01:08:54.520 --> 01:09:01.199
Plutarch talks about this he talks about

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.799
the fact that those priestesses are

01:09:01.199 --> 01:09:06.239
protected and sometimes when they become

01:09:03.799 --> 01:09:08.839
violated it becomes an

01:09:06.239 --> 01:09:12.239
issue one of the groups that is

01:09:08.839 --> 01:09:15.600
violating them are the Lacey

01:09:12.239 --> 01:09:20.080
why why what do our tex say why are they

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:22.600
doing this because if you defile a

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.080
virgin and by virgin I mean anybody

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.880
under the age of

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.080
development right anybody not sexually

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.920
developed if you

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:35.960
defile one of them they can't be

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:39.319
possessed by pagan gods because

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:43.679
everybody knows even the Ley know that

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:46.920
the Greeks won't let them serve a God if

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:49.960
they've been bananana so what is our

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:53.520
strategy what is our mono monotheistic

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:58.520
strategy in the Kingdom of the Lei what

01:09:53.520 --> 01:10:01.760
do we do what do you think we do yeah

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:07.199
terrific no it's

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:09.920
horrific we Dlow them we deflow them and

01:10:07.199 --> 01:10:12.280
the Romans are like no no no no this is

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:16.239
you know this is not going to

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:18.080
work right you have to protect the

01:10:16.239 --> 01:10:21.159
status of the

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:24.440
innocent and that's why they clean up

01:10:21.159 --> 01:10:29.120
the Lacey that's why they clean it up

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:29.120

those horses they developed a mystery

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:04.480
that drove the mind of Western

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:09.440
Civilization you would not be here

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.440

women it is a fact people that the

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.400
history is way more

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:23.280
interesting than the fairy tale that you

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:26.880
were taught

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:29.800
through theology and religion through

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:35.400
monism right through monism haven't you

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:35.400
ever wondered why it is that faith is so

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:41.400
necessary we're people of the book what

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:45.199
is our faith in it's faith in that book

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:48.480
and if I tell you if I tell

01:15:45.199 --> 01:15:53.440
you that that book is a

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:56.440
forgery and that it is a sad copy of a

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:59.560
mystery that was originally bakic and

01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:01.040
produced by the power of mother Greek

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:02.920
