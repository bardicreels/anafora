miscategorized good for you guys keep going so that's one but the Q&amp;A

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:27.800
function is actually exploding with people who are telling me that there's ample textual evidence that apparently

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.919
none of us are reading n ofers reading take it down for one second

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:40.360

[Laughter] sources are you kidding me are you

00:07:52.159 --> 00:08:00.599
kidding me do you know what the Epic of Gilgamesh is it's what what every Greek

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:08.720
knows a third grader can write right because languages are not

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:16.479
equal and the little lie kitties that we all know that they're telling you is that this language is equal to that and

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:24.879
we're in a universe where everything is created equal that's not how language

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:31.080

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:27.560
stear oh look it's bulk it's bulk your language Hebrew

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:34.199
ancient because modern Hebrew is flourishing it's about 60,000

00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:40.600
congratulations right now it'll survive fantastic but the ancient Hebrew that

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:49.199
for some reason has a minuscule hittite hitte oh yeah

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:55.680
literature you call that stuff literature those are lists bro groceries

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:01.399
that's not literature and that's not a language that has hundreds of

00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:10.120
thousands of captured images oh god oh love it keep going keep

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:16.000
going um yep next one next one now I want you to look at the Hebrew and I

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.720
just want you to notice that those two words that we just looked at in Greek

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:32.240
the alofonos right and the arossos that that what is that in the

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:39.760
Hebrew that is represented by four different words four different words to

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:47.679
generate two in Greek and those two Greek words are

00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:54.520
technical terms whereas the Hebrew are not because when you've got a000 you

00:17:54.520 --> 00:18:01.640
don't have room for technical yeah it's the way it is okay science people we love it we love

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:07.840
it you love it I'm going to jump on the audience here in just a minute because I want to interact more I want to amen I

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:16.360
want to hail Satan I wanna I want that kind of thing but I want you to see this now now go to the next slide and we're

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.960
I'm gonna show you a vid here in just a second um this is the people who he's

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:29.240
not sending to the people of substantial speech right okay so don't worry don't

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:36.559
worry Ezekiel you're not going to have to talk your way through anything right don't worry just chill out for a minute

00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:43.760
go to the next one right these people um yeah try that one um I just

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:53.039
want you to see that the word for tongue is very specifically and um used in a by

00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:58.400
grammarians right in a specific way and you can talk about different dialect

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:05.600
legs so these are types of speech that ultimately are different groups of

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:12.760
languages and apparently Greek by the thir century when this text of Ezekiel

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:21.640
is written it makes perfect sense that it's written by a Jewish person who is using

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:28.440
the Greek with some difficulty in order to express something

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:35.640
about his own history where God openly criticized the

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:45.280
poor people for having a speech that was so you know you can go there because

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.880
they're not going to take your uh um your speech and have a

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.720
problem with it right and then he says well I could have convinced the other Smarties if I wanted to right that's how

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:04.280
God is that's how God is you got got to give it to him okay just lay off him for a minute here while he's under the chair

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:12.400
of focus yeah and um so what I want to do is I want to go now I want to go now

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:18.039
to a place a place where we can look

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:24.080
at a a a a new symbol that's been hiding

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.200
in our society for several millennium

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.280
several Millennia we haven't been able to pull it out of the ether but tonight

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:40.840
we're going to and it's with all due humility that I say it's my honor and

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:48.559
privilege to bring this to you it's my honor now before we get there we have to go through some humans we have to go

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:56.480
through some humans and we have to we have to look into the mind um there's a very confused group of people these are

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.080
Bible scholars Bible scholars they're very confused these are preachers these

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:08.640
are priests these are rabbis these are people who are very very

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:17.559
confused very very confused about what came out of the

00:21:17.559 --> 00:21:22.840
prophet's mouth

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:29.320
wheels wheels within Wheels can we have the wheels please JY when you get a s

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:35.520
people let's just take it take a look at this little this little you know short

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.039
little kind of documentary of the confusion hit it Wheels did not turn

00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:47.400
about as the creatures went their rims were high and awesome and all four rims

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:53.480
were full of eyes all around what a when the living creatures moved the wheels

00:21:53.480 --> 00:22:00.320
beside them moved and when the living creatures Rose from the ground the wheels also so Rose wherever the spirit

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:05.840
would go they would go and the wheels would rise along with them because the

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:11.640
spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels I think this means that God

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:17.640
sees and cares about what takes place upon the Earth though events seem out of

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:23.520
control we know that not only is God in control but also we should be comforted

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:30.440
by the fact that he sees and knows what takes place on the earth I don't even know that means in movies very famous

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:37.559
movies this is a movie from 1997 this is the movie contact and in the movie Aliens had sent

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:42.840
through radio transmission a schematics to make this machine you're seeing this wheel within

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:49.679
the wheel that's spinning here is something I photoshopped to give you a better you know crude idea of what maybe

00:22:49.679 --> 00:22:56.200
Ezekiel was seeing was additional Angels next to U that are called ofanim with

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:04.159
Glory round about them right with the sparkle glean round about them and that they're a part of this system that moves

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:10.799
the mobile Throne of the father Hallelujah if

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:18.919
you believed any of that was substantiated by these texts um you're

00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:27.440
as full of it as an doctor of divinity yeah you're as full of it yeah

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:34.440
isn't that fantastic such confus did you see the Monstrous stuff that they were doing I

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:41.760
mean I've seen worse I went to Basil right um right before Hoffman um died

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:48.400
passed away um it was a big deal at the time too and I presented at a conference

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:55.120
there on um you know I was doing my thing with the drugs and history you know and

00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:01.440
um there were artists there and they would have loved these depictions they

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.880
would have loved it oh you haven't seen the eyes all over no it's because you're

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:12.000
mistranslating it you're mistranslating it look right through you're

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.120
mistranslating it oh because this wasn't in Hebrew you see in Hebrew it's got to

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:25.919
be Wheels because it can't be anything else right remember 8,000 words if you

00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:31.240
restrict yourself to 8,000 words words unique words watch how quickly you run

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:37.080
out of things to say yeah it's fantastic um so when when

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:44.600
the Old Testament or the Torah was actually written in the 3D Century um by

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:51.679
this Jewish person or people who had an education in Greek and had been raised

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:59.720
in Greek they began to be able to express that culture natural literate

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:05.120
spirit and when they did they had to borrow heavily now the passage I want to

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:10.360
remind you the passage that I just showed you that had the two words that

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:15.600
were based on the same roots that the Hebrew broke down into four I want you

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:21.440
to understand scientifically that

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:29.000
what the rabbis and Orthodox and fundamentalists want you

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:38.440
whether they have a cross or not want you to believe that those Greek

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:45.039
words popped into the Mind 72

00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:53.320
dudes who segregated themselves into different cells and when they

00:25:53.320 --> 00:26:00.480
received power of God they were able to transmit one translation now strangely

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:06.480
enough in that passage the Greeks were able to take four Hebrew words and say

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:12.080
hm look let's just make two words we can use the same

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:17.720
Roots it'll be gorgeous that's what they want you to

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:25.039
think it popped into the heads of these people it's a fairy tale the original

00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:30.080
must be the document that is more highly

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:35.559
technical if it's highly technical it's got linguistic

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:41.240
radiation that the Hebrew cannot

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.880
express that's the Greek oh God I love it okay so what is this monstrous thing

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:53.360
everybody just looked and you're like what eyes scary

00:26:53.360 --> 00:27:01.080
right right they're doing the best they can come on man they don't read the original right so what do they know I'm here just

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:09.799
to reassure you and to announce publicly tonight people at Harvard and Yale yes

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:15.360
if I could stay on YouTube and do certain things I would do

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:20.559
them listen to me listen to me are you

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:29.240
ready here it is wheels wheels what are wheels

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.840
let's look at

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:41.320
it oh by the way in this translation of this thing is absolutely hysterical it's

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:49.720
hysterical to read because you can't make it's nonsensical what the Hebrew did in the mastic text to this passage

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:57.519
is hilarious right it's hilarious you can't you cannot make this stuff up so um what

00:27:57.519 --> 00:28:05.080
what is it actually saying it's saying the Troy these

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:11.559
Troy what is a tros please can we go to what is tros it's the big definition

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:18.600
look this is the word just go here just go here this is the word that I want you focusing on are you ready just one Greek

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:24.200
word this is what they are calling the wheels right and of course it has to be

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:29.440
through the Hebrew it's got to be a freaking wack cartwheel right no no

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.559
watch the sophisticated language the more technical language watch how it

00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:41.440
dealt with it where's our definition then is it no yep here take down the

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:47.559
yeah there we go no the one before the one before it that's the one we need first look at this people look at this

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:56.880
for a tros what are some of the definitions of tros right they are those turning things

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:02.559
yeah yeah yeah they are they are what else are they they're cakes they're

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:07.600
cakes they're little round cakes that we use in sacrifice right little round

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:14.240
cakes and when I say sacrifice you probably don't understand what I mean but I don't care let's you can eat them

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:20.000
you can burn them oh God God I can smell it in the air can you smell it I had to

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:27.440
fumigate the place before so Jehovah could show up let's do this let's do this get me to the next that one now

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:35.679
what else are there um they're drugs they're medicines but I wanted you to see that the diminutive is used all the

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:42.919
time it's a standard for these medicines right because they're small little

00:29:42.919 --> 00:29:50.159
wheels they are small round Pebbles and what do these medicines do

00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:55.440
how do you make them I'm going to show you he describes what the makeup of

00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:03.080
these medicines are and in the process process of describing it due to translation you think it's too giant

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:10.960
what with eyes and the what who right okay no people right this is reality the

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:19.120
fantasy world is over Satan told me no more it's too much fantasy we need more

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:25.559
reality we need more reality please bring us some reality are you ready I'm

00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:31.960
going to show for those of you you who can't appreciate the magnitude of what I'm

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:38.720
telling you Christians have labored

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:46.080
Jews have labored not the ones they knew in Israel they didn't give them they didn't give a rat's backside about the

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:52.519
Bible right they were more interested in democracy so okay that's cool right but

00:30:52.519 --> 00:30:57.760
the religious side that they always talked about derogatorily I mean it was terrible

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:05.480
but they always talked about because they were dragging their country oh well it doesn't matter that's a different discussion that's a different discussion

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:12.120
Israel Israel let's get back to Ezekiel shall we shall we get back to Ezekiel

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:17.519
let's go um bring it up the next one yeah we're somewhere in that there yeah

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:24.519
not too many people's no no strange speech let's keep going let's keep going look at this people why are we doing all

00:31:24.519 --> 00:31:30.080
this because inside of these pills right the

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:36.440
troos is a pill that you make one of these pills

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:42.960
do they contain the pelma zoas the

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:48.120
pelma zoas if you don't know what this is It's

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:53.919
because you've never been there you've never had the hand of God if you had had

00:31:53.919 --> 00:31:59.120
the hand of God now do you see what all the Christians do you realize they've been fighting for centuries to figure

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:05.200
out what these things are what are these wheels what are these wheels do you know

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:11.519
why you couldn't figure it out let me just say this to Christianity tonight I want to say it to all the Divinity

00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:18.760
students out there to to everybody everybody who was preaching and teaching

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:26.080
and all the sophisticated from the lowest Pastor to the most high Fant

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.200
trained rhetorician who's got his 20,000

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:37.480
followers putting in a cash in a bowl putting in cash in a bull by the way you

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:44.360
notice there's still no commercials right it's part of the reason I'm staying low on the algorithm

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:50.200
is because I don't I don't hook I'm not gonna

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:57.240
hook yeah yeah so for anybody who's been asking me to be involved in the the

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:04.320

T fantastic let's keep going hit the next one chewy look people are going to

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:59.519
love this so we didn't know for centuries we didn't no and so now let's

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:05.159
look and see what the drugs they're talking about are right let's see what

00:34:05.159 --> 00:34:11.679
they are let's go to the spirit what happens Ezekiel you junkie after he gags

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:18.320
you did you see God right before you guys got here um God was um sitting here

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:24.079
and took ezekiel's head right took ezekiel's head and he shoved this book

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:29.240
in his mouth and what uh that's what it sounded

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:36.878
like uh sounded like a gag little bit right and what happened bring back that

00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:43.878
Greek this is because that's what happened in the Greek w w what happened the spirit the

00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:51.720
Spirit came and ripped him off the ground yeah jerked him up jerked him up

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:58.760
the spirit did took him in a place in a place oh God are you ready what else

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:05.680
Ezekiel you dirty drug user what else are you doing you thought this was fairy tale didn't you no you didn't satanic

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:13.480
congregation I'm talking to the guys at Harvard yeah guys and you know whatever

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:19.960
and the spirit yeah next one please Che hit the next one and what happened you know it's that hand of God thing he says

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:27.560
it several times well guess what people think it's Tinkerbell's dust right not Tinker

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:33.520
Bell's dust right it's not it doesn't say it's Tinker Bell's dust anywhere because

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:39.040
Ezekiel also out of his dirty mouth comes the hand of

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:46.920
man the hand of man you know what what makes the Troy you know what makes the

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:53.359
drugs the hand of man yeah you see the drug is the

00:35:53.359 --> 00:35:58.880
interface between Humanity and

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:05.040
Divinity humanity and Divinity and we see that in this third Century

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:10.960
text Greek text oh God isn't that gorgeous you

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:17.200
didn't think it was there right right off the front this is the front of Ezekiel by the way it's in the third

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:23.079
chapter when God starts insulting him being like Yo God your your language

00:36:23.079 --> 00:36:32.440
blows right that's a direct quote by my God your language

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:38.839
blows yeah it's very simple right they're not designing these drugs there

00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:45.720
you know you got to give them a break it's just a cultural thing you know the Romans they're in Huts man Romulus and

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:53.240
Reis you want to think about Romulus and Reis I know we got a lot of fans out there I'm a child of Venus just like

00:36:53.240 --> 00:37:01.680
Julius Caesar but Romulus and Remis were living in Huts bro they were living in

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:07.640
Huts yeah they had until the you know they had to get somebody they had to

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:15.000
import Somebody by the way their mother she was the Priestess the Lupa isn't

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.079
that fantastic she was the Oracle do you see who was making things work do you

00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:26.720
see who was ruling do you see where the power really was in Antiquity oh God I

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:32.200
love that that makes me so excited I love that okay stop this we need do

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:37.760
these people a service will you come on I get it together do your thing go where

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:45.000
else are we going why are we doing all this Ezekiel because Aon

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.440
hor what is the hores what is that that's the Visions

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:57.359
baby that is where we get the Visions you need we need those wheels for vision

00:37:57.359 --> 00:38:02.640
Vision uh yeah yeah I told you this that

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:09.040
I am describing to you now is the interface between

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:14.160
us and Divinity it's the

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:21.480
interface wow you know he said they're G to like it right

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:27.200
Harvard Harvard's knocking at the door but you can't do the text what's your

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:35.359
problem what's your problem Harvard oh my God I'm gonna say it and I know he he

00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:42.079
won't get mad at me so I'll say it because he won't get mad at me and I really really like the guy I really do I

00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:50.000
have so much respect I have no more respect for any scholar on the planet than I do Carl Ruck right everybody

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.359
knows that I call him lucumo right it's the word the atrasan

00:38:55.359 --> 00:39:01.880
word for priest poet yeah isn't that great isn't that

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:07.920
great um anywh who um Carl Rock I was very I'll never forget um I was in

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:13.800
Boston and he had invited me for um there was a paper and the department at

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:19.440
Boston University that I gave and very was smashing success people loved it um

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:27.079
and then you know um he took me to Harvard said Yonder look I'm

00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:32.880
there yonder Harvard and I said I looked at Harvard

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:40.480
and I looked back at Carl Rock and I I said why do you look so sad and Carl rck looked at me and I'll

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:48.160
never forget he looked at me right in the eyes and he's so tall he's looking down on me right he's he's like a he

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:53.319
like a giant right seriously big and he

00:39:53.319 --> 00:40:01.720
says he looks me right in the eye and he says it's not what it used to be and he had such Sadness and Sorrow in

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:07.079
him I thought yeah yeah

00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:14.319
congratulations Harvard congratulations amazing and you know you

00:40:14.319 --> 00:40:22.319
think why would the devil be so mad why would the devil be so mad at an institution right why would because

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:28.800
those institutions were the reflection of the ancient

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:35.280
Museum that was civilization you see what's happened to

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:40.319
it they're sitting around debating oh we don't need to look at those sources

00:40:40.319 --> 00:40:47.040
there's a ton of it but we don't need to look at it because we've got some scribbling it's much more

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.920
important libraries people libraries libraries let's go look up

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:58.359

just want to shove the pill you can shove the pill like Ezekiel right there's different ways to

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:15.559
administer these drugs right these Troy and what they're

00:45:15.559 --> 00:45:21.800
doing to people how do you think they're getting the vision you know where prophecy comes from I'm going to tell

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:29.079
you this Harvard Yale will not tell you this and if you look at their panel of speakers you're going to laugh Harvard

00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:36.680
and Yale won't find it if they looked hard enough they would

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:42.720
find that these are the substances that are driving the

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:47.800
prophecy they're connecting the language

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:53.280
itself when you enter into that mental

00:45:53.280 --> 00:46:01.319
Place through the drug you enter into the vision it's the only way that we're

00:46:01.319 --> 00:46:06.440
all going to get it do you think these people sat around and creatively made this stuff

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:11.880
up seriously yeah or you can follow the

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:18.319
fairy tale and watch your watch your charl and hon part the

00:46:18.319 --> 00:46:23.920
waters yeah you can but you've been misreading the text and I love to do it

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:30.559
every Christian out there I can feel you I can feel you right now I can feel you

00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:36.599
I've got my arms around you every Christian out there I can feel you this

00:46:36.599 --> 00:46:41.680
is the reality this is the reality they

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:50.680
receiving Visions from drugs yeah prophets speak from drugs and

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:56.400
drug use so I got news for Harvard it's not just that they've got this in the

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:02.200
ancillary in the air flying through the air in Antiquity it's not that it's not

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:07.319
that it's that it's Central you don't have the Mysteries without this you

00:47:07.319 --> 00:47:12.760
don't have it what do you think they're doing in those

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:19.240
tents fantastic go to the next one go to the next one I want to finish up here

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:24.599
look and what happens this thing functions on the basis of your hor if

00:47:24.599 --> 00:47:30.119
you read this in Kings you're going to laugh your bottom off right you're going

00:47:30.119 --> 00:47:35.800
to laugh um but what happens you know these drugs function they use it like go

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:41.760
around they they can't they they can't translate at a competent level so they

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:48.839
drag it down um it's garbage it's absolute garbage and because it had to

00:47:48.839 --> 00:47:54.480
be filtered through that mastic Hebrew it lost everything so you know we have

00:47:54.480 --> 00:48:02.960
though we have it sitting right here what does it say right this drug functions within the movement or the

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:11.359
impulse right of that Spirit yeah yeah it

00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:17.920
combines it combines with that

00:48:18.319 --> 00:48:26.839
pelma do you feel it on that inhalation do you feel it that is the

00:48:26.839 --> 00:48:32.720
pelma that is kicking you into the

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:38.160
vision yeah now it was rough it was none of the stuff is ever easy right was like

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:44.040
it was like falling down hitting the ground right rolling H get up right

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:49.319
right Jesus is all like oh my goodness his face is all covered with clotty

00:48:49.319 --> 00:48:54.520
gross stuff right what the stuff on his look you can take it and you can like do

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:59.599
like that with gross man it's just gross it's on your face bro if I were the cop

00:48:59.599 --> 00:49:06.240
that arrested him with that naked kid I would be like dude I'm not wiping his face right you're gonna you're gonna

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:15.079
clean out my car right shout out to those Roman cops

00:49:15.079 --> 00:49:22.160
right all right so what oh that felt good for some reason I don't know why guilty pleasure let's go to the next one

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:29.920
what happens look people look people people oh my God the form of these drugs what

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:37.960
what did they have they were they were liquid courage baby they were pill courage these are courage pills and what

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:45.200
do they have they have this reflection in each of their four basic

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:51.720
parts right this a compound drug made of four different drugs now take this down I'm going to describe to the people

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:57.680
exactly what's going on it's the first time this has ever been exposed I want I want you to think about it this is how

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:04.240
they make the drugs you make them as Stones they call them letho

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:10.480
Pebbles right Pebbles because you're G to be putting this into your rectum

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:19.359
right so you don't want a boulder right so they're gonna I know chewy no right

00:50:19.359 --> 00:50:24.960
um uh right sometimes they tie you up so does it matter I don't know um but you

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:31.880
take the this is how they're preparing the medicine so you make the compound and then you harden the compound into a

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:39.720
bowl and then you take that ball which is perfectly round and has no back and that's why it's very funny when it talks

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:45.240
about the eyes okay they're they're totally misrepresenting the text all the

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:51.799
Christians every English translation of it sucks sucks because they went from

00:50:51.799 --> 00:50:58.119
the mastic Hebrew text from the 11th C Century well 10th Century 11th century

00:50:58.119 --> 00:51:03.559
somewhere in there right was developed over time

00:51:03.559 --> 00:51:10.720
so yeah we're obscured we can't see what's actually going on so you take this little pill and then you recode it

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:16.359
you make more drugs and you put another coating on it you make more drugs let it

00:51:16.359 --> 00:51:22.839
dry put another coating on it finally you've got your four and why do you need

00:51:22.839 --> 00:51:28.799
four because dummy the universe is divided by

00:51:28.799 --> 00:51:33.960
quarters don't you know that haven't you been paying

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:41.319
attention Okay good fantastic all right so now we've got our

00:51:41.319 --> 00:51:48.359
troos or our tro in the plural we've got our tro here just like Galen they're

00:51:48.359 --> 00:51:53.799
going to have seals on them they're going to have some kind of stamp that's what they did with

00:51:53.799 --> 00:51:59.599
these um you good when you purchase them um it's got to have a stamp so that you

00:51:59.599 --> 00:52:06.720
know this is provided by this doctor or that doctor you got to know who's responsible for it when Galen goes to

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:12.160
North Africa to purchase it's like 12,000 I forget how many tablets he he

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:17.760
buys but he buys these and they course they have to have

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:24.440
the seal the limy and seal on them right to show that they're up to standard it's

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:29.880
like stamping it so that you can know well that's in this too but the problem

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:37.920
is we don't understand it because we're working with a bastardized text if you

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:43.520
just look at the Greek and you've read any medical text

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:49.599
in Antiquity all of a sudden it makes sense I I didn't get the other read of

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:55.280
it when I actually looked at the text I thought oh well what they're using the drugs see they're using the drugs I

00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:02.200
jumped up and down was happy right and then I had to look up which passage it

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:10.079
was to find out oh this is the wheels oh God oh God keep going with the text

00:53:10.079 --> 00:53:16.559
people keep going let me just show you a couple more things in here right this thing is divided into four sections

00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:22.240
right it's really four coats right and its parts will work

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:29.559
together in conjunction they don't stop or inhibit the action of the drug

00:53:29.559 --> 00:53:34.760
that's what it says now you read this in English I I

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:42.480
everybody go to King James tonight and look up Ezekiel chapter 1 and read it

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:49.079
and you will get then why people are so confused one more time and then we'll take I want him to see that video again

00:53:49.079 --> 00:53:56.799
um yeah and they're Hoops sauce right these pills they're hoop sauce and they transl this is where they transl is high

00:53:56.799 --> 00:54:01.920
right these are from the these are from the height no it's not hoop cistos right

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:08.240
it's just hoop sauce and what is hoop these things are the Acme of the punch

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:14.680
the pharmaceutical punch right this is not the stuff you go get because your elbows get sore at night because you're

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:21.880
getting older and it's cold right your elbows get sore so you go get some pills for that right um this isn't that your

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:28.240
kid has an earache crying maybe te brething right go get him some opium

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:35.119
right go go get him this is not that either this is one that is at the Acme

00:54:35.119 --> 00:54:42.720
of your mental transformation right this stuff will knock you off your feet it's why the

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:49.319
prophets use it you think the drugs you use are sophisticated modern world you

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:55.200
haven't seen anything let's go for it it's no wonder we have no profits right

00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:03.680
right why do we have no profits anymore because it's not about the individual drugs right it's about the craft of how

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:10.040
to use the fire fantastic let's look it um the very bottom uh the very bottom

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:17.240
line those eyes right so as he's examining the pills he's noticing that

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:26.160
all four sections have this modeled appearance of eyes right so what

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:33.480
essentially is Ezekiel doing he's just giving you a description of the drugs

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:41.079
this was not something that anybody who was contemporary in Reading would have scratched their head and said oh my God

00:55:41.079 --> 00:55:47.720
you mean he's building giant rings um that there's a legion of fiery angels

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:54.240
and there's oh some kind of ring thing and there's eyes coming out of it and H

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:59.280
don't be gullible play the video one more time I want I want people to see it

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:06.359
this is what they make of it Go the wheels did not turn about as the creatures went their rims were high and

00:56:06.359 --> 00:56:13.000
awesome and all four rims were full of eyes all around what a when the living

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:20.640
creatures moved the wheels beside them moved and when the living creatures Rose from the ground the wheels also Rose

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:25.799
wherever the spirit would go they would go and the wheels would rise along with

00:56:25.799 --> 00:56:31.920
them because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels I think this

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:37.960
means that God sees and cares about what takes place upon the Earth though events

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:43.839
seem out of control we know that not only is God in control but also we

00:56:43.839 --> 00:56:50.160
should be comforted by the fact that he sees and knows what takes place on the earth I don't even know what that means

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:55.839
in movies very famous movies this is a movie from 1997 this is the the movie

00:56:55.839 --> 00:57:02.559
contact and in the movie Aliens had sent through radio transmission a schematics to make this

00:57:02.559 --> 00:57:10.920
machine you're seeing this wheel within the wheel that's spinning here is something I photoshopped to give you a better you know crude idea of what maybe

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:17.400
Ezekiel was seeing was additional Angels next to U that are called ofanim with

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:25.440
Glory round about them right with the sparkle green round about them and that they're a part of this system that moves

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:33.039
the mobile Throne of the father hallelujah hallelujah isn't that amazing

00:57:33.039 --> 00:57:39.960
so um what we need to do is we need to actually look at what's written there

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:46.839
and you know maybe bring that forward instead of acting like a bunch of

00:57:46.839 --> 00:57:56.119
jerks yeah do you see what it does when you drift from classical education

00:57:56.119 --> 00:58:02.200
you drift from reality you have to remember Julian was saying the

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:07.559
Christians first thing they're going to do is destroy education what he was

00:58:07.559 --> 00:58:13.039
talking about was not what you and I call grammar school what he was talking

00:58:13.039 --> 00:58:18.640
about was a classical education there is a

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:25.599
reasoning built in to the Greek there is a reasoning that is there

00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:32.640
that they will destroy says Julian in order to meet their purpose in order to

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:42.119
bend it they will bend that light and so what we must do is take back those texts

00:58:42.119 --> 00:58:50.000
they must become ours again so that we can show people what was going on you

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:56.079
didn't realize that Ezekiel was on a drug trip if you're a Christian sitting

00:58:56.079 --> 00:59:01.319
there tonight you didn't realize that if you're just a student of religion if

00:59:01.319 --> 00:59:07.160
you're just a student of divinity you didn't realize that prophets were only

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:14.480
prophets because of the drugs you didn't realize that Jehovah was so mean to his

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:19.680
own people said your language blows right don't worry I'm not going to

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:24.960
send you to anybody with a brainy language right there's a reason for that

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:31.240
because when this is all written in the 3 Century that is the historical

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:39.680
environment of the author or authors yeah right fantastic okay last

00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:48.280
um I think I've got one last thing to say um and then I'm want to bring on I want to bring on uh um Gnostic informant

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:54.760
um yeah no I've already I've hit it I've hit it let's do it um tonight welcome uh

00:59:54.760 --> 01:00:01.920
our premiere of initiation apocalypse um welcome Neil and I want

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:07.520
everybody everybody to be give a warm welcome I'm gonna reach out to the

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:14.160
gallery in just a minute right I'm gonna engage I'm gonna do something new and Engage The Gallery directly because your

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:20.319
opinions now are important but before we do I'm gonna give the stage to Neil he's

01:00:20.319 --> 01:00:25.400
been reading a ton right just working the sources like he always is and and

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:30.599
we're going to hold him responsible for keep guarding those sources Neil go

01:00:30.599 --> 01:00:37.680
ahead you're on that's what I noed difference between someone like you and me and like most mainstream academics is

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:43.160
when they're when these when the mainstream academics are talking about whatever

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:49.599
topic their initial reaction to recommend something is some sort of

01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:55.400
article written in 2025 or 2025 didn't even happen yet like 20 2020s or

01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:00.839
something some current article on a subject and say you know a good a good

01:01:00.839 --> 01:01:06.640
reading on this subject is an article from Dr blah blah blah blah blah from blah blah blah University he wrote an

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:13.440
article a couple years ago about this oh this person wrote a book a couple years ago on this subject you should check out their book on this you don't get that

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:19.079
with Ammon or me I say let's go right to the primary sources and dig this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up

01:01:19.079 --> 01:01:24.280
let's look at what this let's look at what the Greek says try to trans see what the translation's correct see if we

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:30.119
can have a see if we come up with a different translation maybe it's not the same that's how technical you and I get

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:37.680
we go that deep but there there's a hallelujah hallelujah I'm I'm just gonna interrupt and I'm gonna say hallelujah

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:43.480
that's wonderful okay now I'm gonna shut up it's a big difference and and so I like to come on here when I'm working on

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:49.119
a current video I like to come on here and just share some of the stuff that I'm looking at because I'm trying to

01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:57.760
piece together when I'm making my videos the hardest part is to get it into a script that's coh hesive and um you know

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:04.319
some sort of like a storyline going on rather than me just throwing a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out the wall and see because that's how my older videos kind of came out and

01:02:04.319 --> 01:02:10.599
now now I'm starting to get better at like putting it together in a more narrative way it's really hard to do

01:02:10.599 --> 01:02:17.400
some of the stuff I'm looking at I'm working currently working on comparing Jesus to bakus because recently Dan

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:25.559
mclen was had a video he came out with talking about how somebody one of his one somebody like tagged him on on uh

01:02:25.559 --> 01:02:32.960
Tik Tok or something asking him what he thought about the dionan Mysteries and how the Eucharist could possibly be have

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.319
bowed influences from it and he just shut shuts it down and says no th that

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:44.000
that's that's Madness that's just people squinting hard enough and seeing the two

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.640
eventually start to look the same when you squint hard enough and I just thought wow that is like I I I can't

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:59.000
believe he hasn't even like heard of like Ruck on this subject or Dennis McDonald on this subject or there's a

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.799
lot of scholarship on this that I guess this is outside of the S World though so

01:03:04.799 --> 01:03:09.960
I want I want to make a video going through some of the sources showing the

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:17.480
um and it's not even about Jesus copying bakas it's about Jesus competing with bakus trying to be better than bakus

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:23.480
trying because you bakas was all there was bakas was the greatest god of the ancient world I demonstrated that in my

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:29.359
one video couple months ago Dian Isis is so widespread there is no God in

01:03:29.359 --> 01:03:36.720
comparison to Dian Isis so if Jesus wants to be the Son of God you have to go through bakus to get there so what I

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:43.079
want to start off with I'm going to go through some slides that I got and I'm just want to go through some of now what I'm I'm not going to get into all the

01:03:43.079 --> 01:03:50.520
details of like of the sources of what I'm going to show in my video but I want to go into the deeper stuff this is this

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:56.079
is what we get do on this channel I want to go to some some deep stuff and I want to hear from people what they think about this because I don't even know

01:03:56.079 --> 01:04:03.039
about this stuff yet I want to hear your thoughts Almon and everyone else so let's start with the first slide that I got all right now this is called the uh

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:08.079
parabiago plate and the reason why I'm starting off with this is because the iconography

01:04:08.079 --> 01:04:15.000
it's dated to like the 4th Century it was found in Milan is upper Italy and um

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:22.000
so if if I zoom in you guys see the zoom in yeah okay cool um so okay so here's

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.480
what I want to look at here you go you got add and KY or Si well I like to call her KY because that's the Greek but uh

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:34.599
Edis and cile are sitting on the Chariot drawn by the the Lions and you have the

01:04:34.599 --> 01:04:39.640
uh the cores that are dancing around them right all right we know we know

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:47.279
what that is up here though here's where the luciferian imagery comes in you literally have soul or Apollo Soul

01:04:47.279 --> 01:04:56.880
Invictus Apollo Helios by the fourth Century th those three are merged into one Sun God so so Helios Apollo Soul

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:04.599
it's the same name for the Sun God but there it's by the time he gets to the fourth Century it's this invincible Sun

01:05:04.599 --> 01:05:10.039
character right so Diana is the moon goddess but Diana is also the you know

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:16.359
the Artemis but in between them you can see Lucifer phosphorus which literally

01:05:16.359 --> 01:05:23.319
is lightbringer Lucifer and then Vesper so there's a luciferian symbolism the

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:29.160
the light Bringers Diana luciferia is one of the titles in Latin for Diana and look at look at this look at her look at

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:35.880
his wheel and her wheel there's the eight-pointed star right there that eight pointed star Venus so the imagery

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:41.440
is just beautiful and then I want to come down to here ion so a lot of people there's

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:47.000
people who think this is dionisis but most people think this is an ion but here's what I want to say

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:53.680
about this they're both right because you could see the thoy staff with the pine cone on top he's holding it he's

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:59.000
got the uh official official Garb that dianis

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.119
technically wears all the time with the same way he wears it and uh he's he's

01:06:04.119 --> 01:06:11.240
inside the Zodiac like ion being held up by what I think is mithus coming out of

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:16.319
the rock I'll show you that in a second but here's what's so interesting about this is you have the

01:06:16.319 --> 01:06:22.799
serpent on the on the rod the es sleeping Rod it's a symbol of it's a

01:06:22.799 --> 01:06:29.920
symbol of rebirth resurrection and you can see how in John's gospel they compare Jesus on the

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:35.000
rod to the the snake on the rod right so I'm gonna I'm gonna Circle back to this

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:43.599
but I wantan I just want to get through I just want to get through this whole entire thing real quick down here you have Gaia or uh Tera mat in Latin mother

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:49.079
earth and um and then you have these four seasons I don't know what to think

01:06:49.079 --> 01:06:56.640
about this because the the the uh Scholars are saying that this is like for irrit T but I don't see any ireses

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:02.279
have wings there's are Wing Little Cupids I don't see any Wings on these what I see is I see these little

01:07:02.279 --> 01:07:09.960
characters of the Son of God I see you know holding the The Grapes the Bak bakic symbol the Herm Hermes symbol of

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:16.640
holding the uh the good shepherd symbol all that stuff but I do I think the four seasons are definitely there too now

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:23.960
here's where it gets crazy because this Sim this sort of um iconography it becomes commonplace

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:30.799
during this time period if we go to this one right here this is mithas slaying

01:07:30.799 --> 01:07:36.240
the bull obviously but if you look up top there we go we have the same Diana

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.960
and Apollo you know the two this the light givers with with L with uh with

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:48.599
Lucifer eosphorus Vesper um and uh in between and then

01:07:48.599 --> 01:07:56.279
there's the torch bearers now this is where this is where I want to get deep right where he slitting the animal right

01:07:56.279 --> 01:08:02.640
where he's cutting the animal you can barely see it here but I'm going to show you I'm going to go to my slides in a

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:08.799
second um out right here there's an S this is in Latin s there's an e right

01:08:08.799 --> 01:08:14.920
here a b and then there's an e and then s IO and then so what I want to do is I

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:20.278
want to show you something on my if you can go to my slides there you go so

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:25.359
France Kuman a long time ago was able to he is the one that actually decoded

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:33.159
this he was like the main mithraic scholar of his time and he still is in my opinion all the all the mythus

01:08:33.159 --> 01:08:39.838
digging that I've done I don't see any modern Scholars touching this dude France kumant in his lifetime I think he

01:08:39.839 --> 01:08:45.120
lived from like end of the 19th century all the way until like the middle of the

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:52.359
20th century something like that so he's been dead for a while but I'm I'm not kidding when I say this there is nothing

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:58.400
out there that even comes close to the work that this dude did on mithas and

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:04.159
and not not only myth but like dianis and the the what he basically his whole

01:09:04.159 --> 01:09:10.480
his whole research area is the last generation of paganism like what were the Romans doing right before

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:16.719
Christianity took over what was that religion like we don't know a lot about it every because all the sources are

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:22.359
from like the classical world so we all we know about is like what Ides what Homer says what but there's really don't

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:28.000
we don't have a lot of text of like mythology we have ID and Virgil that's first century stuff what I'm getting at

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.159
is it's a mystery to know what exactly was going on in these later uh fourth

01:09:34.159 --> 01:09:39.480
fourth and fifth century pagans but I think I'm starting to get a clear picture as I as I go along so go back to

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:46.838
the slides again if you can see on the bottom it says Nam seaso and then there's Doo soli inv

01:09:46.839 --> 01:09:53.758
victi mithre the VIN the Invincible Sun God Mithra and he's slaying the bull

01:09:53.759 --> 01:09:59.199
with the name of sabazios on it what

01:09:59.199 --> 01:10:07.040
sasos but what but wait a minute if we go to who's stasios if we go to I don't know Herodotus or diodorus of Sicily or

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:14.080
or even Cicero any of those sources they all will say sabazius is a is is the

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:21.520
Asian dionisis the the name of dianis in Turkey modern day Turkey which would

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:27.920
they called it Asia back then or uh Anatolia which anato means East but uh

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:33.760
anyways East Asia the name of the name of bakus in Asia was sasos so wait a

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:38.840
minute is he slaying sabazius well it turns out that

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:44.840
sabazius is the bull is a bullhorn God he's called the horn son of

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:51.640
Ammon Ammon is a ram God so it get it gets confusing is he a is he a son of a

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:59.560
ram which would make him a lamb by the way the Lamb of God whoa that's kind of weird but it does call him the horn God

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:05.400
in some text he's a born and some text he's Ram horned so so there is the

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:10.520
animal thing going on there but I think if we go deeper we go to the next one so

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:17.120
Clement of Alexandri says something really interesting around 200 ad he says that God in the bosom he's talking about

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:23.800
Gospel of John is a counter sign of the mysteries of sasus to the adepts the is

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:29.120
a dragon passed through the bosom of the initiates and this is like he just kind

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:35.239
of drops this in the middle of his protrepticus text without giving any context like maybe if you were reading

01:11:35.239 --> 01:11:41.120
this in 200 ad you would know what he meant and I'm thinking because that's when these religions were were all

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.360
current so a a current upto-date Theologian of the time period would read

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:53.280
this and go oh yeah he's talking about s but like most people who read this passage are like what the hell is Clement even talking about so I'm

01:11:53.280 --> 01:12:01.600
thinking myself sabazius is considered to be a two-fold god son and father in one a

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:11.199
trinity if you will he's sabazius which is sabat Zeus so he's Zeus but he's also dianis

01:12:11.199 --> 01:12:18.800
rolled into one godhead with and then if you if you extrapolate from that with a spirit that

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:25.040
connects the two just like a trinity would but it's interesting because God he's saying God in the bosom is a

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:30.520
counter sign he's saying that this sasus is a counter or an antichrist or

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:35.639
whatever you want however you want to whatever Linguistics you want to use but he's saying it's like an opposite of our

01:12:35.639 --> 01:12:42.760
God in the bosom of Jesus being in the bosom of the father he's saying sabazius is the is the opposite he's the god of

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:48.760
he's like this luciferian godhead basically so we go back to the slides

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:55.719
again now that's that to me that's interesting I'm still parsing that out I'm still digging through that but I

01:12:55.719 --> 01:13:01.520
noticed that there's always there's usually a snake present in all of these

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:06.679
iconographies of Mithra slaying the bull you see the snake there too so I wonder

01:13:06.679 --> 01:13:12.000
if that has something to do with the the dragon passing through the initiates I mean there's so much imagery and

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.639
symbolism going on that it's it's just so it's such a rabbit hole to dig into

01:13:18.639 --> 01:13:26.040
all this stuff but but here's what I wanted to show this is not new either this isn't a new thing this is

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:31.600
Hercules taming the bowl in like 5 this is this is a coin from like 500

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:37.679
BC and then you have the vi Victory or Nike slaying the bull like this was a

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:44.480
common symbol for over for victory or the Son of God Conquering the elements

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:49.520
because her Hercules is the original Son of God we're talking when we talk about

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:54.840
the origins of Hercules who the hell knows when Hercules was first worship

01:13:54.840 --> 01:14:00.199
because it go as soon as sources pop up there's Hercules there is no like first

01:14:00.199 --> 01:14:05.440
oh F Hercules shows up in 500 no soon as we have Tex we have Hercules so Hercules

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:11.400
is probably a stone age God for all we know that's all I'm just throwing that out there who knows how old Hercules is

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:21.040
but Hercules is the original Son of God he's the original archetype of like the Son of God the hero the you know the the

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:26.360
and so the the the the people of Asia minor actually named their Dynasty after

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:34.239
him the heracle day herac day they're sons of Heracles and so um let's see now

01:14:34.239 --> 01:14:42.080
I want to what I want to do now is I want to go I want to go back to something real quick actually go back to my

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:48.679
slides okay here we go this is crazy this is so wild this is from

01:14:48.679 --> 01:14:53.719
cyia this is a image of probably zel

01:14:53.719 --> 01:14:59.320
moxis slaying the bull and this is a cian I didn't know what this was at

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:06.040
first but do you know how the pope has that hat that he wears this is the same this is basically

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:11.120
the same thing this is a priest garment this is this was a hat for this was a

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:16.960
helmet that only a high priest was allowed to wear for the cian religion

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:23.480
the DOI and cian religion and so this they would wear this helmet and

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:29.920
they would offer their sacrifices and that's kind of crazy like that like look at it it looks like the Pope's head almost but I'm just I don't

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:36.800
know I'm just saying like the it's just the shape of it that really got me um but there you have the bow slang bow

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:43.440
slang uh image right there bakus in the form of an edible

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:50.560
grape and there you have the serpent but next to him you have like uh some sort of dog or cat trying to eat him or

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:58.800
something but like the idea of eating my flesh or being the sacrifice for the world so the idea of the idea of

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:05.239
sabazius being slaughtered as the bowl by mithas and then the idea of the

01:16:05.239 --> 01:16:11.320
sacrifice being the sacrifice for salvation this is from 79 all right so

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:16.840
this image right here is from is from Pompei and it can't be older than 79

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:23.880
ad so we're talking like the idea of bakus being the sacrifice to be eaten

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:30.480
for salvation by the way the linian Mysteries Kyle Ruck does a lot of work in in this area of the Eucharist and

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:37.920
there's no doubt about it that the Eucharist was a magical was a magical right you're taking the Gods in Deiter

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:42.960
being the grain the bread and bakus being the wine the blood there was the

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:49.920
idea of these two Gods entering you when you became um you became Sanctified

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:55.080
through this right there was a baptism involved there was a Eucharist

01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:00.280
involved there was salvation there was it was about promising eternal life that

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:08.040
was the whole purpose of the Mysteries so uh that so that's that's you have to we're starting with the that idea has to

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:13.560
start we have to start off with that off the rep like we're already talking about salvation we're already talking about

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:18.679
sacrifice we're talking about like flesh eating all these elements that are that

01:17:18.679 --> 01:17:25.600
are that are there that are just so obviously in your face let's see let's see what the next one

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:33.080
is okay so this is from one of the myth raams in Italy um and so what I what I

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:39.840
noticed is the mythra were connected to all the old temples of magnam

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:45.719
mat so what you have is you have this late Roman Imperial called priesthood

01:17:45.719 --> 01:17:51.920
and what I'm what I'm noticing is for example the linian Mysteries got shut

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:58.679
down in like four or 375 ad when theodosius was Emperor but we we know

01:17:58.679 --> 01:18:04.400
from records that the last linian herant which is like the pope of the eloian

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.520
Mysteries he's the high priest of the elini Mysteries was actually also

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:15.040
initiated as a level seven Potter which is level seven called

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:20.800
Saturn of the mithraic Mysteries what the hell so he's in two religions well

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:26.000
apparently this religion that Julian was trying to create Julian the apostate was

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.760
this unified Pagan Church where all the all the mystery Cults were sort of

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:37.400
starting to come together as one to oppose Christianity and so you had the

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:43.639
elini and hopan was also a level seven initiate of the mithraic Mysteries and all the myth raams throughout the whole

01:18:43.639 --> 01:18:49.840
Roman Empire were connected to um the temples of magnam mat so you have the

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:56.679
great mother and the great father Saturn which saturnalia is the big Fe the big

01:18:56.679 --> 01:19:01.719
uh holy time of the year the the birthday of the sun December 25th all of

01:19:01.719 --> 01:19:08.440
it sort of comes comes together right um if you go back to that image that I had on the slide this is

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:13.840
Sylvanas so this is now where the room this was found in um this is dated to

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:18.920
the reign of P of of uh P um 160 I think

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:24.800
it was 160 which is he reigned right he with uh Marcus

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:30.120
aelius right before Marcus aelius and um this is has his name on it and

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:36.000
everything but this was a baptism room it was the middle room in between the

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:42.400
mithraic initiate Hall and the uh the sacrifice hall for magnam mat where they

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:48.840
took the bowls in to slay the bowl so you're seeing that this religion was multifaceted it wasn't just about mithas

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:54.440
it wasn't just about magnam mat it wasn't just about Saturn but there were was like a whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there's a whole

01:19:54.440 --> 01:20:00.280
Pantheon of gods all sort of um coexisting in these places that these

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:06.040
priesthoods was sort of are sort of like interconnected in a weird way and it makes me think of like you know how the

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:13.639
Elohim is this singular word that they use to describe the whole godhead right the Elohim all the gods but it also

01:20:13.639 --> 01:20:22.320
could mean one God to me I think that's what Lucifer kind of becomes Lucifer becomes a singular word to describe one

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:28.080
God but also a face of all these different gods Sol Invictus

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:35.600
Diana bakus Apollo you know pan they're all they all sort of become the they all

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:42.880
become like singular under this term Lucifer lightbringer because you have that the imagery of the of the T

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:48.199
torchbearers and the uh the lightbringer is always present in these

01:20:48.199 --> 01:20:54.239
iconographies um so one more slide I want to go through and then I want to show so there you so I'm going to go

01:20:54.239 --> 01:20:59.719
back to one second I want to show this real quick mithis coming out of Iraq holding the

01:20:59.719 --> 01:21:04.800
Zodiac now if we can go back to my my original the first one that I was at not

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:12.239
the last one and I'm almost done here so this is um I want to go back to this so this is

01:21:12.239 --> 01:21:20.159
that's why I think this is mithas right here coming out of Iraq and holding up ion it's sort of like his resurrected

01:21:20.159 --> 01:21:25.800
self it's like two phases of one character and that's why I think this that's why I think the snake is right

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:33.880
next to them it's the same length as both of them because it's sort of like showing the snake uh gives away its its

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:39.239
uh dead skin and becomes new and mithas being born from a rock a new is the

01:21:39.239 --> 01:21:45.199
resurrected ion ion and this is another part of my video that I don't have the notes for here but it's gonna be my

01:21:45.199 --> 01:21:50.440
video I'm going to show that iion was called ion was followed by by three

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:57.960
disciples who were called the krono the Chrono were fa fa basically avatars

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:03.000
of ion himself but they were past present and future so you have three

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:10.080
faces of this you have a trinitarian god called ion this is this this is the same ion

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:15.920
that epiphanius says was worshiped in in uh Egypt after the and born after the

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:22.000
winter solstice and he tells he's telling Christians not to take part in their he's saying all these Christians keep

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.440
taking the part all these mysteries of ion we shouldn't be doing that like he's basically saying that these Christians

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:32.520
are intermixing with the ion worshippers but so I just want now I want to

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:39.120
highlight that thing because Jesus sort of comes out and he's he's um he's uh

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:45.199
he's competing with this this idea of this what the Son of God is the Son of God is like you have all these sons of

01:22:45.199 --> 01:22:51.520
God characters and they all sort of go there's a lot of them get resurrected a lot of them have passions a lot of them

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:57.679
are sacrifices a lot of them are saviors healers sleepious whatever and like you

01:22:57.679 --> 01:23:03.760
can sort of see how Jesus sort of takes on all these different traits but TR

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:08.960
tries to be better than all them well it gets crazier so I'm going to go back to

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:14.639
my go back to my slide again real quick or not slide go back to my yeah this

01:23:14.639 --> 01:23:20.840
one so um am I showing the right one okay

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:27.760
all right can you see my let me just see all right good good this is the one so yeah so that's what I meant by mithas

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:32.840
coming out of ackq holding up ion and then the snake that I he that

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:38.920
uh representing the resurrected mithas or the death of

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:47.440
ion but here's what I wanted to mention because down here you have teus

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:53.120
and Poseidon and anyone will tell you Poseidon is always depicted

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:59.840
with horns that look like crab uh C claws right I don't know if

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:06.960
you guys can see that or not you see the crab claws for his horns right so one more thing I want to

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:12.679
show you and before I get to my last video that's uh this right here this

01:24:12.679 --> 01:24:20.320
isn't from an from an old church from the fourth Century fifth century it was it was an Aryan church

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:28.239
but you can't really hang up by the fact that it's Aryan because the Aryans were just Catholics that had one tiny tiny

01:24:28.239 --> 01:24:33.960
minute difference is that they believe in the Trinity they believe Jesus Is God they

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:39.480
believe in the same books the same Canon they think the gnostics are

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:46.199
Heretics they think they even call themselves Catholics they are Catholics but the one difference is that

01:24:46.199 --> 01:24:51.360
they think that Jesus came after the father they both aren't

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:57.159
eternal such a minute difference but that's big difference big deal for a lot of Catholics anyways the reason why I

01:24:57.159 --> 01:25:04.040
brought this up Jesus is being baptized in this image and look what we have here

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:11.440
the father God the father has the Earth Shaker Poseidon

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:17.600
horns you notice that see see you see the see the uh the the crab the little

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:25.040
crab uh claws on his head and so in this so I know some people try to interpret this as it's the

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:32.000
River Jordan incarnate but I'm not buying that I'm not buying that I think this is

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.880
Poseidon here's why I think that he's being born into the water he's being

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:43.719
initiated into the water and he says this is my son I have

01:25:43.719 --> 01:25:49.560
begotten you right and so what happens when Jesus is uh killed on the cross the

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:57.159
Earth shakes the Earth Shaker appears the Earth shakers mad he cried out to his father on on his

01:25:57.159 --> 01:26:02.639
uh on the cross and the father responded by shaking the Earth that's the if you anyone who knows

01:26:02.639 --> 01:26:07.960
Poseidon and you know ancient Greek text Earth Shaker is Poseidon that's his

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:14.639
title so I think there's something something to be said there I think whoever built this church was um was

01:26:14.639 --> 01:26:20.040
trying to artistically Express Jesus through the through the lens of what a pagan would

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:26.040
appreciate but you might think this is all crazy and I'm going too far I just want to show a video real

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:31.600
quick this my last thing and then then I'm done play the video please the first

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.920
Christians weren't looking for a God who made them feel guilty that would never

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:43.159
have caught on they were looking for a God who would save them and fill them

01:26:43.159 --> 01:26:51.040
with hope so was their model for the first Jesus Christian artists selected the

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:59.520
youngest and handsomest of the pagan gods they chose Apollo the god of the

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:06.239
sun blonde and unbearded Youthful and curly

01:27:06.239 --> 01:27:12.280
haired Apollo was a God who made you feel

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:19.040
good so the first Jesus's were curly haired and pretty because they borrowed

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:26.960
that look from Apollo and it went further than that when this mysterious Christian statue

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:32.440
was dug up out of the ground it was thought to represent a woman an unknown

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:41.360
goddess a muse only later was it realized that this too was an early

01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:53.080
[Music] Jesus in that wonderful Museum in Cleveland the one with the Jonah

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:59.040
marbles there's a carving of Apollo performing a miracle with Nike the

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:05.000
goddess of Victory Apollo is the robed figure on the

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:14.119
left and look how shapely he is how easily we might mistake him too for a

01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:20.760
woman pagan gods could be male and female they could amalgamate the Sexes

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:27.119
and represent both gender at once just like this Jesus here extraordinary as it

01:28:27.119 --> 01:28:34.960
sounds the first jesuses were sometimes made to look feminine on

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:41.159
purpose all right now last thing I want to show real quick because I want to show one more example

01:28:41.159 --> 01:28:46.960
of iconography I got just share my last screen there

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:52.480
mithas carrying the animal and then Jesus as the Good

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:59.880
Shepherd I mean that's Al you can also find Hermes statues of him looking like that holding up the shepherd holding up

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:05.679
the lamb like that Hermes is the Good Shepherd what I'm saying is Jesus is being

01:29:05.679 --> 01:29:11.880
portrayed in so many different ways not just dionisis not just ion not just

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:17.600
sabazius but like these many faceted sons of God characters that Jesus is

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:23.520
competing with where he sort of like through through adop their images they

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:29.400
rewrite the he's rewriting them in in the likeness of Christianity that makes

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.440
sense so that's what I got so

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:42.800
far oh my goodness oh my goodness I was paying attention and that was some of

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:49.760
the hottest material congratulations now seriously on a professional level Neil

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:56.880
that was you know i' I'd have respect for you if I came to a conference in Classics and I saw that presentation I'd

01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:02.800
be like this guy knows his sources he knows his sources my God yes

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:07.880
sabodo that's the one that I think is the craziest

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:16.920
equals he's being slain for mankind it's salvation yeah he he equals Sabo the

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:22.760
verb in Greek equals AO that's what the ox

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:29.840
lexicon tells us when you AO when you shout bakus or when you shout

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:38.199
AWA you are doing the seasian manner you're doing the seasian

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:44.480
just something I didn't think of this till right now isn't there some play on the Greek in the in the gospels when

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:49.639
he's being I don't know which gospel it is but there's a there's the argument that he you if you break up what he's

01:30:49.639 --> 01:30:56.360
saying Sabah cathon right yeah yeah no when he shout and he

01:30:56.360 --> 01:31:03.840
says he says Lama sabak Thor right and everybody's like anybody who heard that

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:11.639
at the time would know exactly what cult Jesus was functioning within just by

01:31:11.639 --> 01:31:17.080
that right sabach thone no problem and it's a magical incantation and all the

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:22.520
scholars and Divinity people right not the classes because don't touch this

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:29.880
stuff because they don't want to they don't want to need the headache you talk to any classes I tried to get Ruck bring

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:35.040
in the naked boy Rock bring the no come on come on he's got to keep his job

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:41.400
right he wants to stay out of that so I don't have to I'm fortunate enough that

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:47.400
we can go ahead and bring in Jesus's naked boy but okay I just want to make

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:53.960
one or two comments on everything that you showed first first of all go to the

01:31:53.960 --> 01:32:01.760
tight tight brother that that junk was tight as tight gets right you cannot

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:07.480
walk away from that evidence you cannot walk away people you were gonna get just

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:14.760
one you got double in the end you got a climax there a day M you got everything

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:22.360
with oh I'm so impressed beautiful I'm I'm I'm Gob smacked at the you know if

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:30.360
you and I were just in a wrestling match um I'm not quite sure who they're going to call right it's it it may be a split

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:35.719
decision right I I'm serious I'm serious Neil I'm serious that is real

01:32:35.719 --> 01:32:41.480
professional real good stuff real good stuff okay what I want to do now is take

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:47.679
it just take a couple of questions from people um I will pick them because I'm

01:32:47.679 --> 01:32:55.440
in charge but I want you to be thinking about everything that Neil was presenting there and I saw people

01:32:55.440 --> 01:33:01.960
thinking about well do this you know somebody asked I'll just start with this W CH was waiting for good questions to

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:09.159
come up I'm gonna say hey um somebody already said jump the gun and said hey

01:33:09.159 --> 01:33:15.600
um could it be that when they talk about multiple snakes for example being in one

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:20.880
sort of drug that these are different coats so to speak exactly these are the

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.560
different ele

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:32.639
on that there's all these little like serpents and bugs and different

01:33:32.639 --> 01:33:37.679
creatures on that on that plate and I'm thinking that's got to be some sort of drug reference there why would they just

01:33:37.679 --> 01:33:44.520
be throwing random animals on this thing yeah and John Scarboro said you know the

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:52.159
um the Scorpion that's usually in the mithraic reliefs um sometimes there's a

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:58.119
scorpion right under the testicles and it looks like it could be stinging them

01:33:58.119 --> 01:34:04.639
right and then all of a sudden you think you know John scarber was like you know that that has some kind of crossover

01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:14.080
with the fact that you and I are reading medical text that have to do with you know scorpion um toxin being used in the

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:20.960
treatment of um or to induce um infertility it's like a

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:27.040
chemical castration oh okay yeah makes sense with the Unix and all that kind of stuff it

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:33.960
kind of it fits very well the pharmacology fits I love it okay I'm gonna look at a couple of questions Neil

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:39.920
did you have any just put a cap on it while I'm hunting for

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:47.400
questions and yeah and about the unic thing the uh the byzantines kept that system in place they seem to have kept

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:52.639
that system going the Unix system it makes you wonder if they're interpreting

01:34:52.639 --> 01:35:00.320
the text those who are Unix for the kingdom of heaven and they're taking that as like a green light saying well

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:08.239
we have it in our text where we're allowed to uh create Unix for our kingdom because um as farb back as early

01:35:08.239 --> 01:35:14.719
as early as Constantine and going all the way deep into the 10th Century you had a Division I forgot what the name of

01:35:14.719 --> 01:35:20.639
it was I was showing you a couple days ago it was a weird name for it but the

01:35:20.639 --> 01:35:27.360
the name ter in Greek literally it means like those who sleep aside the emperor that's what that's what that's

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:33.719
what the atmology is and there it's a unit of Unix that are chosen at what

01:35:33.719 --> 01:35:39.880
from I don't know how they choose them but they're made into Unix and they're given over to the emperor and they live

01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:46.639
in the emperor's quarters the emperor the highest the most powerful man in the world arguably depending on what time

01:35:46.639 --> 01:35:52.360
period we're in and he's got a whole little band of Unix that live there with him

01:35:52.360 --> 01:36:00.920
him it's interesting yeah nice nice you're exactly right right the one who shares the bed um Can can you explain

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:06.159
the biblion that goes in the mouth so Neil we're talking about Ezekiel and

01:36:06.159 --> 01:36:12.440
we're talking about using this little book and we talked about this in the Greek magical papy because they do the

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:21.440
same thing there and they actually describe the inks that are the psychotropic inks so something is going

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:28.239
into his mouth and ending up inducing this quaking remember he's talking the

01:36:28.239 --> 01:36:34.600
seismos remember he's talking about um those horns and

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:45.480
initiating those horns that that Thunder that Quake that g oos that that um inos

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:54.040
gion that Earth trembling um force is that Force within

01:36:54.040 --> 01:37:02.119
the communion it enables you in the communion because remember we're talking about mithraic stuff right right and um

01:37:02.119 --> 01:37:10.159
this is all um religious operation slash medical operation an

01:37:10.159 --> 01:37:15.320
event right we're inducing things you got remember this is this is a time

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:21.040
where religion and science were one there was no like today they're dueling

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:26.639
now you have science and religion dueling but we're talking about a time of the world where the people who were

01:37:26.639 --> 01:37:32.880
doing science were the religious leaders they were the priests they were the astronomers there was no difference

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:38.880
between astrology and astronomy they they had the technical skills they

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:46.199
had the Monopoly on the technical skills right right those witches are oracles

01:37:46.199 --> 01:37:53.040
right they're all connected they're all the root Cutters they're all the ones that are root um preparing the drugs and

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:58.920
getting people hyped on the drugs you ever wonder why do they why do they go to root Cutters for wisdom and ask them

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:04.480
how to what to do about things what what do you think they they're they're they're doing the the root root Cutters

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:11.719
that's the that's where you get the I mean the it's where you find the highest content of DMT is in Roots not leaves or

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:17.480
or or or like berries or anything it's in the under the ground in The Roots so

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:23.960
the root Cutters are they're going for the magic stuff they're looking for the magic yeah and it's a it's a pure matter

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:30.080
of science I mean if you if you look at what they're doing within the operations

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:36.239
themselves um you and you can see this just by the antidotes that they're using

01:38:36.239 --> 01:38:43.480
and talking about the symptoms that they're trying to alleviate the craftsmanship you said the priestesses

01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:49.719
have the have the technology right exactly and I think that's why the priestesses are the ones that are

01:38:49.719 --> 01:38:55.560
involved in sending out colonies and saying hey you should kill this Tyrant

01:38:55.560 --> 01:39:01.880
or you should bring these people to power I think that's why I think that's why they're there because they possess

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:09.159
that technological Edge and they're doing that that interface um that interface between what

01:39:09.159 --> 01:39:14.960
you and I would call religion or spirituality and the physical

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:20.040
world that interface is possible in the

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:27.040
mystery all the Mysteries are about is achieving that Vision whether it's

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:34.520
Ezekiel sitting there bombed on his wheels that that angel having boom put

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:40.840
him into that I was just telling I was just telling someone a couple day like not that long ago that if it wasn't for

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:46.800
my experiences with DMT I probably would be stolen cold atheist right now that

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:52.239
those experiences are just lifechanging

01:39:52.239 --> 01:39:58.080
like there are there it's magic it's something it's not you can't explain it I wish I can explain it it's not even

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:05.000
worth it feel do you feel Neil that your eyes are open do you feel that your eyes

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.040
are open do you kind of feel that analogy some there's some something that

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:17.560
when you're on and you're in that state where you are opened up to there's this

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:25.239
some there's you just feel like there's something Beyond them this n natural world that we're experiencing

01:40:25.239 --> 01:40:32.440
it just does that now I'm not the only one that thinks that it's not you could achieve I'm sorry if you could achieve

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:38.800
that you know as a human being as a somebody born in nature you know that

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:44.000
there's an achievable end to create what they're doing in the mystery you know

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:50.719
it's a possibility it's not an imaginary world it's not Faith it's not a belief

01:40:50.719 --> 01:40:55.800
it's experity yeah and and it's possible to

01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:04.080
achieve that yeah love it what's the question do you think sabazius is palasan what do you think

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:11.040
what do you think at that question my first thing would I would say about that is well according to diodorus and

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:18.840
according to Herodotus sasus is the oldest dionisis he's the horn dianis and

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:26.360
he's from the Black Sea region and check this out in the Black Sea region and we know the plasan come from

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:33.760
that region and they go and they find the Mediterranean and they populate cre and they spread out from there um and

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:39.199
orth and cre at the same time like kind of at the same time you know what I mean by that anyways but before that they're

01:41:39.199 --> 01:41:44.960
all the way in the Black Sea like Northern Black Sea all all across the

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:50.360
Black Sea and this is where you have the cultivation of grapes and is discovered

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:55.480
ask any anyone any any Anthropologist archaeologist will say the cultivation

01:41:55.480 --> 01:42:02.159
of the grap Vine was discovered in this region of the world so and in the time

01:42:02.159 --> 01:42:08.480
of the and we're talking about a time where any metaphysical concept would become deified the idea of Oaths and

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:13.679
contracts becomes Mythos but the idea of a God that you can drink and and takes

01:42:13.679 --> 01:42:18.719
over your your mind and you have this ecstatic experience ecstasy that's a God

01:42:18.719 --> 01:42:24.239
that becomes a God that had there's no you don't I don't think you need evidence to prove that that was a thing

01:42:24.239 --> 01:42:31.360
that that was a deified concept so you doesn't take a lot of mental it doesn't take a lot of like

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:38.320
logical uh in uh inference to say that's where Dian Isis comes from that's where

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:43.400
the so sasus is a palasan god probably that's what I would

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:48.960
say yeah and I think that's the safest way you can say it because you know you

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:54.719
can hedge it with probably just because look we're when we're talking pans we

01:42:54.719 --> 01:43:00.920
don't have a written record right so we have to be very careful but based on the

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:06.199
Greek words that were saying oh these are probably palasan roots and

01:43:06.199 --> 01:43:17.520
everything they involve and yes guess what their name means the purple right another one surprise um

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:24.239
and are they the ones that are propagating this knowledge you know it's so much the

01:43:24.239 --> 01:43:30.560
knowledge is so technical you look at the mithraic stuff and you think uh okay so what do they do they get together and

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:35.639
they kill a bull no no no you totally you just totally miss the boat and by

01:43:35.639 --> 01:43:41.840
the way there it's underground and there's a lot of sweating and there's some drinking of some body fluids and

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:47.280
there's a whole thing going on a death and Resurrection because they're doing

01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:53.040
it it's the cult and they know how to induce these phases if you can come back

01:43:53.040 --> 01:44:00.239
this way you're a lot more likely imagine I'm going to send you into combat but before you go I'm gonna boost

01:44:00.239 --> 01:44:07.679
you into The Nether where you can see all your ancestors right and when you come back

01:44:07.679 --> 01:44:15.440
with their spirit will go right this is the good stuff man I mean it doesn't get better than this um I think Neil

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:21.440
answered that last question perfectly perfectly real before before

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:28.000
you go to the next one by scobby uh I just want to say one of the things that's so fascinating about this last

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.239
fourth Century generation of pagans is they're venerating the most ancient gods

01:44:33.239 --> 01:44:39.480
on the planet the great mother and and and Mithra you can find them in Bronze

01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:45.679
Age text you can find great mother uh dug up in archaeological excavations

01:44:45.679 --> 01:44:52.880
from the copper age Mithra in the v Zen Vesta or and and then you got like so

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:59.320
some of these gods are being worshiped in the last generation of pagan hood they're they're holding on to Concepts

01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:05.239
that are so old and Christianity is so new compared to this compared to this

01:45:05.239 --> 01:45:10.880
religion that faded away it's a baby it's not it still is even even if you

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:17.920
took the time that Christianity's been in existence right now 2 years what about right around 2000 years give or

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:24.880
take you're still short for how long you're still you're not even halfway there to how old magnam mat and Mithra

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:32.480
are because they're go we're talking going they're going way back way back you know and and that influence is

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:41.360
widespread it's so widespread that we get um people referring to Media as

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:47.639
MRA MRA right and her you talk about the plasan connection her you know Neil

01:45:47.639 --> 01:45:54.920
you've seen it her atrasa name mati is just lacking a row right that's all

01:45:54.920 --> 01:46:00.560
it's that's all it's lacking so that MRA figure we got to remember when we're

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:06.960
looking at lucifera right we have to appreciate that feminine form I loved your guy by

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:14.280
the way on the video talking about the early forms of Jesus being yeah that was a good clip a combination of masculine

01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:20.080
and feminine right I KN you like I knew you'd like that clip I was like I couldn't say this any better myself so

01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:26.000
I'm just clip this guy out and show it to everybody kudos to that

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.040
dude now our question is did Jesus have the alabaster when he was on the cross

01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:39.560
um if they were giving him according to nonas the antidote for the dipass um he

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:49.480
could have had it administered by an alabastron yes but um would it have been

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:57.840
obviously there um during you know look you're opening up a Pandora's

01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:04.960
Box now because now I gotta say and you know I'm going to because you know you want to bring it out when did he get the

01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:10.760
alabastron inserted into his rectum you know at what time if he's got it there

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:16.280
was it something they were doing I mean they realistically they do have the

01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:23.520
antidote they do have the antidote they could have administered it rectly but

01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:30.679
the antidote was soaked into a sponge so we know it's a fluid right for for oral

01:47:30.679 --> 01:47:36.280
consumption technically if he'd us the Deep sess with the

01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:45.760
purple back in the garden when he was with the boy presumably because the boys possess the

01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:51.760
gilan presumably he would have got his antidote back then

01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:57.480
where's the alabastron come into this is he there on the cross the I

01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:04.960
don't know you know he's screaming a lot maybe it shot out halfway through the crucifixion and people were like look he

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:12.480
just birthed the little dionisis fantastic love what do you think Neil well he was given something I

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:18.040
mean depending on which Gossel we're talking about I think it's John where he's given some sort of

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:23.760
sprig some some some sort of he's been he they're giving him stuff so I mean

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:29.520
whatever the text says it says but the fact that he didn't he didn't receive anything is just not true so he was

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:36.880
receiving there was there some of that stuff could be drug references yeah what else you give to a

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:42.920
dying person on a cross besides a drug right right let's see Hercules passes

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:48.599
into the underworld overcoming Cerberus with Bruce Str Hermes by being

01:48:48.599 --> 01:48:55.679
androgynous then there's the castrated boy option are these all different options for sex without

01:48:55.679 --> 01:49:03.000
insemination oh go ahead what do you what do you think I'll let you take that one that's a good question um there is

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:11.480
this what I noticed about what he's the question is also highlighting is there's this uh there's this Universal idea that

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:21.639
all these sons of God have to go through and there's always something to do with um some castration or or some sort of

01:49:21.639 --> 01:49:28.880
some something to do with like castration or the loss of that type

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:37.760
of thing like with Addis for example or Adonis there's always something to do with the sex me a parts that has to do

01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:43.880
with like and and this is what this is where I think goes back to bakas the plucking of the of the

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:51.520
vine um and there's something to be there's something deep about that that's going on there is that that makes sense

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:58.320
what I said it does it does um what is the little what does Aid say orus is

01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:03.800
doing gets in trouble or orus the last

01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:10.560
day before this is the last this is the chapter called the death of Orpheus in in always metamorphosis by the way a lot

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:15.599
of versions take this part out so you only only certain versions of this text

01:50:15.599 --> 01:50:20.639
you able to find in English or you got to go to the Latin and it says that

01:50:20.639 --> 01:50:25.960
orus picked up the thracian right the ancient thracian by the way we talk

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:33.480
about thians the thian Pirates the Lays right so orus is taking up these ancient

01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:39.119
thran lays right and what is the right that he describes of plucking a young

01:50:39.119 --> 01:50:46.840
boy's manhood before he becomes of age that's what it says yeah yeah you

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:53.599
can't get a religious right we're not just doing he actually doing it for fun this is an ancient religious right right

01:50:53.599 --> 01:51:00.880
right this is what do you think this is Epstein's island or something come on man this bigger than that um and it's

01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:07.199
worked into the it's baked into the Empire that is that bonic Empire which

01:51:07.199 --> 01:51:13.280
is all those oracles speaking love it love it oh God this is such wonderful

01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:19.239
stuff um Neil thank you for coming tonight thank you for coming tonight I I

01:51:19.239 --> 01:51:26.480
feel like I feel like um like this is a co-creation tonight and your material

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:32.400
was just delicious I loved it and on behalf of everybody satanic initiation

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:40.599
and now initiation apocalypse I think we owe you a debt and thank you very much

01:51:40.599 --> 01:51:45.920
um did you want to talk about your next you have a what coming out I kind of

01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:55.239
gave you a little bit of taste I'm working on the um the overlap of Jesus in these in these late P late era I call

01:51:55.239 --> 01:52:01.159
it late era because paganism is so ancient first Cent from the first century to the fourth Century I know

01:52:01.159 --> 01:52:06.679
it's a big that's a long time 400 years but that's the that's the end of

01:52:06.679 --> 01:52:11.760
it that's the last we're talking like you can it's a short little timeline

01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:18.560
compared to like how ancient these pagans gods are but how diverse they are in their different regions of the world

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:24.520
and they sort of come together and the Roman Imperial cult as one that's what the Roman Imperial cult does is they

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:31.480
syncretize all these different religions from pathos uh Cyprus and Egypt and Asia

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:39.679
and Greece and North Africa and they just started take all these different gods and sort of they put them all in the one religion and this is what Christ

01:52:39.679 --> 01:52:47.760
in first century when this is right when Rome is really starting to explode in its uh in its influence over the

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:54.679
surrounding regions and Christianity comes out of that soil of that syncretism

01:52:54.679 --> 01:53:02.159
soil and so I'm sort of trying to do I'm making Mo most of the content is going to be comparing dionis to Jesus because

01:53:02.159 --> 01:53:07.199
I think and I think you can make the argument especially if you're immersed I don't think you have to be an expert to

01:53:07.199 --> 01:53:13.320
say this if you're immersed in the ancient text you know dionisis is special he's not just one of the Gods

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:19.520
he's di Isis he's the son he's the great di you know what I mean like yeah yeah

01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:24.679
no no and the fact that he permeates everything he's the one God that invades

01:53:24.679 --> 01:53:31.760
and takes over right and they're like oh yeah he spread from the East right it's all over the place everywhere yeah yeah

01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:37.119
Neil Jesus Jesus Takes Over dianis And there's I don't I I just think anyone

01:53:37.119 --> 01:53:44.400
who can't see that and I I don't want to sound like I'm get cocky like I know everything because I don't know everything but I honestly will like my

01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:51.760
personal opinion if you can't see that then I just don't think you're immersed in the text that you say you are

01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:57.560
bravo bravo well said and you know what if you know the text better than the

01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:05.079
people at Harvard then who's the expert yeah gonna go that far yeah yeah

01:54:05.079 --> 01:54:10.199
hail sat and hail Satan hey thanks everybody for coming tonight I really

01:54:10.199 --> 01:54:16.639
