term if you were to take if you were to take all of just a purple highlighter

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.419

pig a pig yeah you like that I say nymphoma yes it does Neil what's your

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:38.039
question say it again is that does that say nymph for the orphic it does it says nymph uh let's go there

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:45.080
right why don't we go there to the nymph and see how she is the first bearing

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.880
rise the first bearing remember when you're translating this you're not looking through the Christian lens

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:57.539
you're not looking through a Jewish lens you're not looking through an atheist lens or anybody modern you're looking in

00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:04.919
that ancient pool good let's go to that next uh text here because Neil brought it up

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:14.419
Neil this is the text that we're talking about there yeah Delta on El commentoy toy are

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:21.599
Paso that word Apostle is used on the medical side a lot and it's an app it's

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:27.440
a word for applying right I'm applying this this assistant

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.760
uh Stone right to the to the person who

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:42.959
is in this place of need and it's any plat on look at that second line it's full of what says pesio galactos

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:51.720
it's full of this Fez Passage this Oracle bringing milk Oracle

00:08:51.720 --> 00:09:00.120
bringing milk aote just as the mazdon just as the breast protot

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.779
of the the first bearing nymph

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:12.180
okay so um as everybody knows just nature she's had her child and now she starts

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.279
lactating right this epithet that is used to describe Jesus

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:23.820
is a cult epithet that was a cult work right the stones the lethal

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:31.620
um it's called work and within that context it has to do with the application of a drug of a drug so we're

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:40.080
starting to get a right a picture of a right where the milk provides the antidote and that's exactly

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:47.399
what they're doing remember we talked about creating the body through which the communion could can

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:54.000
come so I wanna this is kind of the first topic I want to approach was with Neil

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.519
um Neil so you've got give me that polished Stone

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:08.700
dildo that works as a medical applicator give it to me covered in the burning purple

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:14.880
yeah it's yeah apply it as they would rectally

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.339
rectally right this is the right we're walking through the right and

00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:27.899
this induces a state of mania that we can only describe as

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:33.360
psychosis and we have the descriptions of how the people react when they're in

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:41.339
this state the Priestess that I'm about to show you after whom Jesus is is

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:46.980
um mimicking after whose rights Jesus is performing a mimicry

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:54.180
right he is taking her titles he's taking the nymphs titles and when she uh

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:59.220
applies so I've got the medicine on board right and when she applies her

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:05.760
when I go to the Dark Harbor she applies what's in her vagina through

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:14.339
orgasm to my mouth in that combination I'm going to die

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:22.860
with that combination I'm going to die but if in the process she has rendered

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:29.760
me her breast milk and this isn't any and if um by the way we're talking about

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:37.079
rights people that are drug activated and sex activated so they're combining that's why the word

00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:44.640
for fornication is also the word for just to practice idolatry right so okay

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:52.440
so at this point in the at this point in the right if I have taken of that breast milk of hers which our texts say is only

00:11:52.440 --> 00:12:02.100
from the OM Fox only from the grape breast the grape-like breast of that

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:09.360
um woman that we have engineered that we have engineered that Madusa and

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:16.200
I'm going to show you in him in just a second that Medusa that has the

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:22.920
um titles that Jesus is stepping into so okay if I've had that Delaney they

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:30.779
called it if I've had her breast milk it will keep me alive I may be in a state of death for three

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:37.440
days but if I have that Delaney in me I can

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:44.760
come out of it I can resurrect so okay let's stop there for now and I'm

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.399
gonna throw in some more sources uh Neil where where's your mind on this

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:55.560
so I'm thinking about how in the the depiction of in these gospels there's

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:01.800
there's you have the the the the the three-day Motif you have the idea of him

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:07.800
being thirsty on the cross specifically why would the author write that in there with what's that to do with anything you

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:15.060
have these him chanting uh cathonic father and you know these are supposedly

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:20.940
from the Psalms which is fine because that's what Orpheus would be doing if he's dying too a lot of this stuff lines

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:27.420
up with the rights being applied to this story and I think we lose the context

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:32.760
the Catholic Church sort of shelters their sheep because they're the you know they're the pastor they got the rod they

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:38.940
got that that agor staff and they sort of shelter Europeans for a thousand

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:44.700
years from where these rights actually came from but if you actually told this story to somebody in the first century

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.800
second century in I don't know pathogonia or phrygia they would know

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:55.620
exactly what the hell is going on here that's why you have people like the not seen preacher in the second century but

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:01.320
I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself but I'm just I'm trying to illustrate for people these the context of these

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:08.220
rights make perfect sense for the for the time period but a thousand fifteen hundred years later with with all these

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:14.220
rights being hidden and done behind closed doors we have no idea what this stuff means we have no idea why he's

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:20.639
saying I thirst or why they're pulling out Alabaster or why three days what does all this mean that's what we're

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:29.000
getting at beautifully stated let's call up the next text that we're going to look at

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.980
so look um it's coming in the clouds you don't pay attention he's come in the clouds

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.980
and uh all eyes will see him right whoever whoever you know put in death

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:47.399
whoever crashed him right right and all everybody's gonna see him a night a man

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:52.620
I just want you to look at the last word in this passage right a man

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:58.500
why are we inserting a magic word here right it's very important because this

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.320
is an incantation right this is part of the prophecy when

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.959
he gets smacked into the Wilderness you can take it down when he gets driven into the eremon and he's in a state

00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:18.660
notice that John says he fell on the ground as if he were dead right right these are states that they

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:24.240
are inducing very physical States you know they're they're messing with the physiology

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.699
um and yeah let's go see who that next text let's go see who she is

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:38.760
um look at this yeah I am the Alpha and the Omega why is

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:44.420
he saying that right people are like what does that mean and you can get entire sermons on this that are full of

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.959
Unholy garbage

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:56.579
and look at this look at this Neo you're gonna love this because now we're gonna I'm I'm bringing in C.S Lewis I got him

00:15:56.579 --> 00:16:03.060
right here I got them right here and I'm doing untoward things to him I'm gonna do some

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:08.699
untoward things to him right now right okay you can't see me where I'm doing it

00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:15.959
but I'm doing it look at this last word pantocrator what is a Ponto Cross or

00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:22.079
yeah do we have the next yes give us the next yeah look at this look at this

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:29.519
you know Ponto Cross or oh it's a masculine form of a panto cratera

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:35.760
wait a minute you say there's a feminine form of this word yes and look what the

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.759
source is it's the orific hymns surprise surprise everybody says and Neil knows

00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:48.420
this um everybody says the date on these orific hymns is hard to fix and some

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:54.240
people will say anywhere from sixth fifth century down to Second A.D and

00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:02.519
some Scholars stepped up about 30 years ago when I was still into the scholarship and were saying no no no by

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:08.280
the the archaicisms that are in the language this has to be contemporary

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:14.640
what he said and possibly possibly a century earlier if

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.579
you look at the nuances of the hymns and how they're built and the words that are

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:26.040
being used and how they're being used yeah it's it love it love it so I'm one

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:35.220
of those earlier guys so we have the title for the Ponto crator right but it's in a hymn it's a

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:43.559
hymn to nature which also uses all the empathets that Paul the Apostle who is

00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:50.700
way way immune to snake venom the dude got bit by an ass nothing happened he's

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:56.039
like and he knew it wouldn't happen Ryan's like yeah

00:17:56.039 --> 00:18:02.039
yeah amazing amazing um let's pull up a text pull up the next

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:07.440
text Chewie thanks here it is here it is I'm going to read it from mine whole foodsy

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.559
right Palmetto look at that

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:17.880
this is the mother right this is the all mother

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:25.260
all right this is the all mother fousis that first the second word the first is an interjection the second word foosis

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:31.559
that's their word for nature nature so all of a sudden Paul thank

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:38.460
Paul and when he talks about wait a minute the creation and all things are created through him and by him and for

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:44.460
him wait a minute where to get that phrase we're about to see let's look a little

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:34.799
it's gorgeous just jump down ideas Zoe on the fourth line from the

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:40.260
bottom guess what this idios idea that's our word for eternal

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:45.960
the ion is not eternity Jesus did not come to give eternal life

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:52.080
he didn't never use the phrase eternal life he used the phrase ionic life

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.900

the truth and the life look at the last the third and last line pontes

00:21:08.179 --> 00:21:13.860
This is basically right out of Paul the Apostle all right except switch because

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:20.640
he would have to be stealing it from her yeah yeah we're dressing up Jesus as she

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:27.720
because Jesus is borrowing from this tradition he is operating the

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:34.380
mystery but he's doing it himself not through her right do you understand of course that's

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:40.080
why he's arrested with a naked boy right of course that's why there's stuff on his face

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:47.220
right there always is in the right okay look at uh we got that uh that third to

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:55.440
last line all things right are made right all things are made by and for you

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:01.980
you alone accomplish these things right you are that Telos

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:11.159
of the mystery you are that completion go to the Colossians text please where's

00:22:11.159 --> 00:22:19.340
the Apostle Paul here come here come here you bitter oh no it's not that one

00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:24.679
go down now

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:32.039
where did she go father Cantera no now here's the sound pink though look at

00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:37.679
this this is the Revelation guys look at number 10 and I I was in the Panama I

00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:42.840
was in the spirit are you in the spirit yeah how do you get kicked into the

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:52.020
spirit right these angular are always doing this and I heard this great voice as a solid pinks as a trumpet and right

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:57.980
here here uh take that off here we can delineate corruption from the pure

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:04.919
they're fundamentalists there from both sides of the Evangelical or Jewish side

00:23:04.919 --> 00:23:12.179
who will walk around with the shohar you know they got some kind of animal

00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:17.419
horn and a bird you see amount of protesting in front of trump too right

00:23:17.419 --> 00:23:23.520
it's a thing it's a symbol it's that trumpet they they want that they're

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.919
Jericho followers and they you know who I'm talking about and they'll they'll walk around Jericho and blow the horn

00:23:28.919 --> 00:23:35.340
and bring down the bad guys right um and they often confuse that with this

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:40.980
and that is not what this is the corruption is the Hebrew side of it it

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:46.980
comes through that through the horn it's not what this is this is Etruscan

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:52.080
this is Etruscan that thing that they carry around it's actually a trumpet

00:23:52.080 --> 00:24:00.240
they can smack you with it too um go to the soundpings definition soundpinks look at this solid pinks War

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.600
trumpet and look at what word what word it's using

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:15.419
that yachos Neil is you know who iacoast is oh yeah this is that shout that comes

00:24:15.419 --> 00:24:22.020
that bockach shout through the South pinks wow yeah and if you just jump down

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:28.020
my mind's going on right now okay good that's the chant that's the

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:33.179
secret chant of the ellusinian Mysteries yeah yeah it's the it's a war trumpet

00:24:33.179 --> 00:24:38.400
yeah yeah you know this kind of pan destroyed the enemies of his father with

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:44.600
his voice by screaming right by chanting at them and destroyed them with his boy

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:51.480
this is some we're going deep right now the uh the next one will show you that

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:57.900
the tearsanoi are the ones who carry that thing around right it's called the it's called the

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:03.240
Etruscan of the tyrannian horn yeah so isn't that cool it's a

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:10.380
divination instrument as well that's what all the augers are using so when you walk up to the Pope

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:16.740
nicely and you're like hey I like your stick and it's based upon it it's got

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:22.400
looks like a conch shell kind of thing guess why that is

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:28.679
the augers yeah yeah it's it's uh brilliant next text Olivia

00:25:28.679 --> 00:25:33.840
I want I want Neil um look at this Harold give the signal and restrain the

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:41.880
crowd and let the piercing tyranny and trumpet filled with human breasts and forth It's shrill Blair to the people

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:48.000
who is this and what's the context it's Athena she's setting up the Law Court

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.080
and she's using the tyranian trumpet to do it she's using that turinian tool right

00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:01.440
she's that Polytechnic God yeah good Neil comment what do you think

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:08.940
Athena holds the demiurgic power of of of Victory and creation equal to Zeus

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:15.419
there's no one else besides Athena who holds it that's why you see Zeus holding Nike in his hand or Athena holding Nike

00:26:15.419 --> 00:26:21.179
in her hand that's it there's only only two and Zeus by the way in the derveni

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:26.580
Papyrus is called the first and the last and it's almost like is this what Jesus

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:33.779
is trying to become he's trying to do these orphic rights so he can be like Zeus and be the son of Saturn

00:26:33.779 --> 00:26:39.600
I'm just saying a lot of this stuff is lining up pretty pretty pretty nicely for me

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.880
yeah and it makes you wonder you know why does a man want to take on these

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:51.299
titles if all these titles are working within the cult and the mystery and he's

00:26:51.299 --> 00:26:58.559
using that thing in operation he's actually performing it um it puts him into a light that we

00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:05.039
don't normally get through the judeo-christian tradition right

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:11.279
um we don't we just don't see that we don't see the right for what it is let's go

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:17.100
give me another text I got a couple more taxes here I just want to take a look at quick

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:24.240
yeah yeah all things here it is because all things you know were made by

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:31.260
him and Uranus yeah okay and Uranus and on the Gaze yeah the

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:37.640
things orata the things seen and the Things Not Seen

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:42.900
even if they're Thrones all right we know where those are right

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:49.880
our audience knows what those Thrones are or the curiotetes the the powers

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:57.059
yeah the archon ships right the authorities all these things

00:27:57.059 --> 00:28:04.919
right are done through him and to him right his manifestation into him that

00:28:04.919 --> 00:28:14.240
foosis that line is exactly what we see in the orphic hymn to fuses to Nature

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:20.820
it's the exact same um imprecation Paul is taking very

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:28.020
cultic material and is adapting it to his as if Jesus had stepped into the

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:34.020
place of the one who's who's in oysters speaking of using this this cultic

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:39.440
language in Revelation thought the sea

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:45.659
and Hades and Thanatos those are three different orphic deities

00:28:45.659 --> 00:28:51.000
that you offer hymns in in the orphan in the orphic hymns and these are they're

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:59.700
giving up their dead and then being cast into the Lake of Fire as if they are deities or figures and would people just

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:06.419
read this in church and have no idea what it means right so how can they possibly when they

00:29:06.419 --> 00:29:14.640
come up with their dominionists and all their theologians how can they possibly even begin to decipher this stuff if

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:22.980
they don't know the actual context I mean you've been interviewing a ton of experts right and they're all examining

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:28.620
if how important is it that you know where that dirt is that you're in that

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:34.860
dust I mean what have you seen now because you know you can go completely different sides of the argument you can

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.960
just you can do a lot a lot of circle jerkering I've seen one translation that

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:45.840
says death gave up its dead and death gave up its dead twice

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:51.539
like what is they're just gonna ignore that there's two different the Greek has two different words here and they just

00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:57.240
translate Hades as death and then and then death as death as well and so the

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:03.960
context is gone the the English-speaking Christians of uh you know UK and America

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:10.620
they're like little children that are being like sheltered by the reality of what they're actually worshiping and

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:17.640
doing they have no idea where this stuff comes from they're it's it's kind of fascinating to even to like witness that

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:23.700
they don't know what it is because the the translation loses all context

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:29.940
they sit they sit in darkness right they sit in darkness you should uh clip that

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:35.580
what you just said I give you permission if you need it you should clip that

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:42.480
um it was a perfect statement of watching it's funny you're right it's funny to watch the people and they they

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:49.260
perpetuate like fairy tales they're like little traditions and little stories that have nothing to do with what's

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:55.980
actually going on right in the text so um real quick before you move on someone

00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:01.799
the crowd who's watching this if you have a friend who's still a Christian do this as soon as possible tomorrow

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:09.240
tonight whatever bring up that verse where it talks about Hades in the sea and death giving up their dead

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:15.000
ask him hey what does this mean to you just ask them just I just you'll be

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.380
amazed at the reply you'll get you it's you'll probably get a million different answers for a million different people because no one talks about it it's as if

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:28.740
it doesn't exist and I would bet that most pastors wish it wasn't there we should just we could

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:34.760
just delete that part because obviously there's some there's something going on there

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:42.120
fantastic you're right you're right and also tell them hey I would also tell your friend who's sitting there trying

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.159
to decide um look at Jesus when he's arrested and ask yourself what's he doing with a

00:31:47.159 --> 00:31:54.240
naked boy yeah right what's he doing what's the kid doing there yeah yeah because something he's doing

00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:00.539
something with him and you're and your own Pastor will tell you Mark is the shortest gospel because every word

00:32:00.539 --> 00:32:06.419
matters there's no extra information there's no extra fluff so the fact that

00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:11.700
Mark would have an extra fluff sentence of and a naked boy ran off with a sin

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:19.080
down on his on his on his stomach no no no no no that's there for a reason you admitted yourself there is no extra

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:24.960
information in mark because it's the shortest gospel it's packed with punches every syllable means something what does

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:30.299
that mean well that's just extra information no no either you're the one that said it you're the one that said

00:32:30.299 --> 00:32:37.140
every syllable matters in Mark that's why it's so short tell us what is Mark 14 telling us that's what you have to

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:43.279
figure out brilliant another short get get

00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:49.320
the uh get that last uh text up there I think this is the last one yeah and to

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:55.380
the angel of the assembly and laodicea right write these things

00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:03.000
um I just want you to notice that it says there so says the amen

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.320
the amen right he is the martus the pistos he's that witness he's that

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:16.559
faithful he's that alathenos that true he's the arche

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:21.260
what is what is he the ruler of

00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:28.740
now what's funny is um that thesis is exactly what the same

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:34.860
word that is used in the hymn um he is that Builder it really means

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:42.179
Builder yeah it really means Builder and it's used originally of her

00:33:42.179 --> 00:33:48.480
she's originally of urania yeah that all Builder

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:55.019
yeah that one that brings that power um and there's a lot of other you know

00:33:55.019 --> 00:34:02.100
there's a lot of other from the hymn for example she's also the Salas for the Salas foreign the bringer of that light

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:08.940
that is from the lightning yeah so um that cellos is a big part of

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:14.460
the cult mystery cult there's a mystery of iniquity right working the mystery of

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:21.000
anomia that's already working right and once that restrainer is

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:28.440
stopped um the man of lawlessness can come forward

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:34.679
um it's all mystery operation uh good stuff mystery operation and I think

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:41.638
that's uh I think that's all the text that I had yeah that's all the text that I had I

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:47.158
want uh people to see that there's overlap that there's overlap and so one

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:52.339
of the benefits of having Neil come then is to say okay

00:34:52.339 --> 00:34:59.040
what do we say then when we're on that when we're out there with the scholars

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:05.060
we're not there with the scholars and we're talking to them how can you

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:11.280
push this information how would you deal with your

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:17.700
um your audience Neil when you're addressing your audience how do you present this information do you present

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:22.800
it as look um this is what's here or D just kind of

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:30.780
kind of weave it in so what I'm saying is when a professor steps out on the edge with you you know

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:37.260
how skittish they are because they don't want to be proven wrong or something right when they're out there in that

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:44.640
world and they're trying to explain something you're going head-to-head with when you come across something that you know is BS like you've seen the reality

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:49.920
here you know the orphic you just said oh this is the orphic rights right it's

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:58.380
being practiced the Christians are doing it what do you say to the scholar that doesn't know that level of the text

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:04.260
Alice never lies you go to atlas because Alice Alice gives us the Linguistics

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:09.480
which never the Linguistics Linguistics is the roots of everything so we go

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:15.900
there first we talk about the Linguistics we talk about Ellis then the sources we go right to the right to the

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:22.560
primary sources we don't need any some some Theory from hold on let me fix this real quick some Theory from some guy in

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:29.820
the in the in the 19th century we go straight to the sources straight to a third Century sources BCE

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:36.420
2nd Century B Alexandria Rhodes right to the Greek right to the Latin and we pull

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:42.540
it up and we put it side by side and say Here's what they're saying they're using the same terminology they're using the

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:49.140
same chance using the same drugs and then here he is in the New Testament being used in the same way and you're

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:56.820
going to sit there and say it's you don't see it so we show them we put the sources together and you there's

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:02.760
there's no playing around when that when we do that that's what we do that's what you do I've learned that from you like

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:10.260
you when I first met you you brought up a lot of and really mind-blowing

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:17.520
theories and and not I shouldn't say theories but kind of theories but like at the time with other theories

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:25.079
and then we show then we went to the text went to the sources there that he's right I holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is mind-blowing

00:37:25.079 --> 00:37:32.760
stuff and you once you show someone the sources they can't they can't deny it like they can choose to go like this but

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:39.839
like these are the sources the context is the is when we go back to the first century Greco-Roman World these are

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:45.720
things that are being done in mystery Cults in Egypt in phrygia in near El

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:50.940
luces in Athens in Rome actually too so these are the things that are happening

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:56.760
on the on the ground throughout the empire in this time period and without that context you would never know

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:03.000
because we live in a whole completely different world today I would pass the Puritan age and the

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.400
scientific Age of Reason all that that's ain't that's the ancient world it's a whole different world that we're not a

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:14.220
part of anymore so that's something people need to realize

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:20.339
I want to ask you why you're here about Hermes because this epithet that Jesus

00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:26.820
uses uh when I say Jesus I mean when John paints him with this epithet it's

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:34.140
an epithet of Hermes and particularly Hermes as the angel loss as that

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:40.500
messenger of God who ends up having that sun relationship

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:46.020
with the father right he's the son and you could say he's the son of God he's

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:52.320
called logos too yeah and he's yes and he's transmitting that right oh he's

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:59.339
true I'm glad you brought that up because Justin Martyr admits this Justin Martyr in his apologia by the way what

00:38:59.339 --> 00:39:05.880
are you apologizing for what do you apologize the whole apology I think Justin Martyr says you have a logos too

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:10.980
you guys call him Mercury and then you have asclepius he's also the son of of

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:16.740
he's a Son of God too and you know you has have all your logos and and yeah and

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:22.020
that's important because Mercury as someone like Philo relates and

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:28.320
philo's doing the same thing Justin Martyr is doing a century prior to all all his alexandrian cultic friends that

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:34.440
he's trying to impress you know he's like the he's the one he's that one the one Jewish guy that's trying to join the

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:39.740
club and everyone's like nah bro like let's get that Yahweh stuff out of here

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:46.380
this is what this is true he is he writes about Philo says but but what about the the logos and mercury and all

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:51.660
this stuff what about and he's playing this whole apologetics thing and uh yeah

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:59.040
that's and so Mercury Hermes Angelos the messenger he only does what

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:06.119
he's told by Zeus he's very he didn't he never breaks uh breaks what Zeus makes

00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:12.180
him do he does exactly what Zeus does and he comes back and he says Zeus I've done it for you what else you want me to

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:19.200
do now and then he goes over and then Prometheus just kind of breaks the law so Prometheus and Hermes you see this

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.780
demon and Angel dichotomy way before Christianity brings

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:31.260
this stuff to light but yeah this is all cultic imagery cultic language this is

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:37.320
the way of the of the world in this time period absolutely yeah and the fact that he's

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:42.900
using that Jesus is using these epithets and all of this language that's

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:47.940
connected with the mystery you'd have to be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I mean really I stand back

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:56.160
and I look I look at us and I think oh my God we how do we not see it how do we

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:01.680
how do we somehow fail just with the original text

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:08.460
and I'm telling you this failure is perpetuated Century by Century by

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:14.160
Century every time um control goes to the church and the it

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:21.780
and they're able to manipulate the information we get a fairy tale Enlightenment and going to those texts

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:28.920
ourselves and reaching into those texts brings back this right and uh um this is

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:37.880
fearful this is a fearful place for the church this involves the abuse of children Jesus Christ himself

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:46.140
comes from an abusive performance comes from a a performance of a mystery that

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:51.780
is centered around child abuse what you and I would call child abuse so either

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:58.020
we get into it I mean when you come on let's get into the tough part um when you're in the temple and they've

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:06.359
got you tied up and that Priestess has applied that medicine to your bottom and has put you

00:42:06.359 --> 00:42:14.060
into a state where you are approaching that sexual Climax and she ejaculates

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:21.599
drugs made by her own body into your mouth

00:42:21.599 --> 00:42:26.880
and then proceeds to give you the Cure that'll bring you back and remember

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:31.980
you're in a psychotic state you're in a psychotic State you're in

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:37.099
that demonic influence right you're under that influence

00:42:37.099 --> 00:42:42.540
at that point you die you know and come back sometime

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:48.720
thereafter thankfully because of it um if this Priestess

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:54.119
is one of the dancers at d-loss right

00:42:54.119 --> 00:42:59.160
she is very much underage she's very much underage and this makes everybody

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:04.880
uncomfortable to which I say Athena you should be uncomfortable

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:10.079
Athena that virgin that you protect is that same age group

00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:18.060
um there's one phrase in the hymn tonight the most important that I didn't I didn't read to you uh let me just read

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.660
it to you now

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:39.000
yeah um she is the medwa she is the Medusa

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.480
in The Ether in the water yeah everywhere

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:52.079
right she is that Force so again you would get there to that spring

00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:58.740
to to that great pure spring you would get there under these circumstances so

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:05.579
much so that in this initiation you only have to do it once on a person once on a person once you've had that

00:44:05.579 --> 00:44:13.920
World open and your eyes are open and you come back from it through Resurrection you never go back you can't

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:19.260
you've been born again you've been born again so uh I don't know your thoughts

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:25.020
observations on the right Apple lay us relates this when he says that when he

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:32.579
got initiated into Isis in Osiris he was dipped in the water seven times because

00:44:32.579 --> 00:44:39.500
of the Pythagorean method that's what he says that exactly he specifically says in the Pythagorean sense dip seven times

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:45.180
and so you had this idea and also in the text in in the god in in the baptism

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:51.720
scene where where when he comes out of the water the heavens open up now you might someone might say well that's

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:57.180
because he's the he's the son of God but the the text to me is relating a more of

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:03.060
a initiation message this was an initiation that this person had an

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:09.300
experience the heavens opened up so it makes sense on a different level than

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:14.700
what most people are reading for the when they're just reading it who don't have ears to hear if that makes sense

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:20.700
the initiated ear reads this passage and goes I know what they're doing yeah he's got

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:27.660
he got initiated all right he took he took the rights he he drank the milk he took the Soma he did so you you get what

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:34.800
I was getting at he Bacchus entered this entered him and that at that State that's what that initiation is back to

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:40.140
apaleus dipping his head seven times and coming up out of the water and that's

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:45.660
that's that experience that's that Awakening that's the the those with ears

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:52.380
to hear that's that's the initiation process and correct me if I'm wrong Neil but in

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:59.640
ambulance there um that whole process only came about because she

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:07.800
was able to transform him from an ass in back into a human form through the

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:15.599
rose right Isis does it through the rose if you're there in the right and you are

00:46:15.599 --> 00:46:20.819
entering the orgasmos and you fall into

00:46:20.819 --> 00:46:26.160
death and are brought back with her image

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:33.420
um you can't you can't ever become an ass again because you know right imagine if you

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:40.319
were able just for a second if we were able to do something quantum right put you in some kind of state

00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:45.480
so that you could see the dimension that is beyond the black

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:51.960
holes that are in our universe and you could see that we are a reflection of that imagine if you could make that

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:57.900
bridge and then come back um you would never you'd never be the

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:03.780
same you'd never right Obed writes about this but he gives you the opposite the

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:10.440
opposite of that coin is this King Midas who doesn't have ears to hear

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:17.460
wants to be initiated he's granted the Golden Touch right Bacchus gives him what he wants but he

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:24.480
doesn't he can't handle it he wants to he wants to be saved from his from his uh from his weaknesses from his

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:31.260
spiritual weaknesses right he doesn't want this Golden Touch anymore so what is he he's told to go and dip yourself

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:36.420
into the the Hebrews the same river where Orpheus just died a couple

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:42.000
chapters before where he bled to death in this water here goes King Midas he

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:49.920
dips into the water and he's walking back and he cured him cured his Golden Touch okay cool but as

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:55.859
he's walking back he sees pan and Apollo and they're having a a violin

00:47:55.859 --> 00:48:01.920
competition who sounds better than they say hey hey King Midas come here be the let's let

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:07.859
you be the judge and he's he he uh had a terrible he didn't have ears to

00:48:07.859 --> 00:48:13.740
hear let's just say that he didn't know how to judge this competition and Apollo looks at him and goes you don't know

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:19.440
what the hell you're talking about so as soon as as soon as he's told that he

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:24.480
doesn't have ears to hear he gets ass ears grow out of his head

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:31.319
ass ears it's the opposite of epileus instead of becoming human from becoming

00:48:31.319 --> 00:48:36.780
an ass and being salvation getting salvation through Isis it's the opposite

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:43.980
effect he starts to grow as ears because he doesn't have ears to hear and he doesn't it's a it backfires on him

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:49.140
which makes me wonder why Jesus has that ass head

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:55.220
um in his earliest crucifixion depiction right across

00:48:55.220 --> 00:49:03.060
you're so right he's the ass yeah the the only reason I recognize that symbol

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:08.760
is because the the guys like nikander who is this pharmacologist this preacher

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:14.339
not preacher Prophet uh priest at an oracle who does this I mean he's

00:49:14.339 --> 00:49:19.980
actually one of these guys who does this and writes about it so

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:25.920
um yeah how can we possibly deny the context of what's going on there's a guy

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:30.960
that ejaculates on Crete he ejaculates scorpion

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:37.020
and snake venom he ejaculates it you can get it out of him

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:43.440
yeah it's a and nobody nobody stops and says wait a minute what and which

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:49.619
scorpions are they talking about why is he doing this right it uh people miss

00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:58.500
the context that jet that asses ears by the way um nakander this crazy Prophet priest

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:04.380
pharmacologist um says that the and he takes his own name

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:11.579
and he puts his his name in the each letter in the first uh first word of the

00:50:11.579 --> 00:50:19.079
line and spells out nakander right and in these verses he talks about the ass

00:50:19.079 --> 00:50:26.579
that is given the burden of the deep sass the snake that brings when that

00:50:26.579 --> 00:50:32.880
brings that thirst when Jesus says he has the Seven Stars in his hand one of

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:40.020
those stars because he tells you right they give it away in the text he says those are the ongilloy right there's the

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:48.359
angular so right away you say oh wait a minute these are the ones that are standing in front of that Throne right and what do they do in front of that

00:50:48.359 --> 00:50:55.020
Throne they cast that image they bring that image and the dips ass is one of

00:50:55.020 --> 00:51:03.119
them it takes all seven in order to induce the death state

00:51:03.119 --> 00:51:09.119
takes all seven isn't that how the hell did they figure out

00:51:09.119 --> 00:51:15.980
um that you could combine seven different Native venoms you could put them on a in a solution

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:21.780
and put them expose them to the blood vessels of your colon

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:28.020
and rectum and induce this mental state that if you

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:34.740
combine it with the orgasm ends up putting kicking you into Zone

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:39.780
that everybody else comes back from and says their life has been changed that

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:45.839
they've seen Their Eyes Are Open there's a reason when the devil offered it right because he's guarding it he's guarding

00:51:45.839 --> 00:51:52.200
that tree there's a reason when he offered it he's like no no he's full of it God's full of it he just doesn't want

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:59.520
your eyes you to open your eyes and to be like he is right and then what happens they get naked there's no

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:06.660
preacher on the planet that can explain why Eve is getting naked and their attempts to do so are so lame and

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:12.000
pathetic they're so lame and pathetic uh what's

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.700
hap what's happening um her when her eyes are open she realizes oh no you

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:25.260
know here comes Jehovah and I'm totally nude with ooze all over me and I've been places that nobody's gone before that

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:32.339
explosive orgasm that explosive orgasm is the right that's where you go when

00:52:32.339 --> 00:52:37.380
you die right and that putting that on to

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:43.020
somebody casting that mystery changes everything around you it changes your

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:49.140
perception the experience of the initiates of the illusion Mysteries they

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:56.280
held those when they held that ceremony anybody who took part in the Mysteries if you could find me a source that says

00:52:56.280 --> 00:53:01.800
the opposite of what I'm about to say I'll give you a million dollars because it doesn't exist there is not one source

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:09.660
that ever said someone who came out of this unsatisfied or then their life didn't change but the specifically it's

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:17.280
really strange specifically it's about losing the fear of death for whatever reason the initiates they

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:22.319
go through the Mysteries and eluses they come out no more for your death very

00:53:22.319 --> 00:53:27.540
strange I'll give you an example there was some some uh some servants that were

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:33.720
sent over by by the king of India to meet and delegate with Augustus

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:41.220
Augustus was just so so powerful that the world was all bowing to him Parthia

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:47.540
gave him all the standards back that they took from crisis he was the man he he was the king he was the August one

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:54.240
never been done before he he surpassed Alexander so King porus ironically the

00:53:54.240 --> 00:54:00.119
same name as the king that Alexander meant different King Boris he sends him a bunch of delegates and out of like the

00:54:00.119 --> 00:54:05.339
seven that he sends three of them make it the rest of them died on the way there they bring him all these presents

00:54:05.339 --> 00:54:11.579
they bring him like exotic cats and lions and snakes and uh one of the one

00:54:11.579 --> 00:54:16.680
of The Travelers asked Augustus I want to go to the famous elosinian Mysteries

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:22.800
to get initiated Augustus was like I've already been there I've been initiative I'll do it again let's go Augustus has

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:29.400
like seven initiations from different Cults all over all of the Empire he's down he says all right I'll take you there it's winter time they're closed

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:37.500
but on the August one so we could go so they go there they open it up just for them start a whole new initiations off

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:45.420
season this Indian Indian character it is Brahman gets initiated when he came out you know

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:51.960
what his reaction was he jumped into a fire and killed himself because he said I'm done my life is complete

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:57.300
that was that was his reaction from the Mysteries he was so blown away by what

00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:03.780
he saw that he jumped into a fire and killed himself and ended his life because he was complete and nothing else

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:10.079
to live for that's what happens and so when when Jesus says I thirst and like

00:55:10.079 --> 00:55:15.780
again with with Mark 14 with a naked boy there's no extra information in these

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:22.859
texts there's no extra fluff those words are there for a reason they're sending a signal to the reader

00:55:22.859 --> 00:55:31.940
if you know about the Mysteries you know what this means why is someone thirsting what does that mean you don't yeah

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:38.400
yeah beautiful beautiful and we all say oh it's Hebrew Lama no it's not it's

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:44.520
actually Greek Magica yeah it's their magic that's going on I love it I love

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:50.700
it Neo it's an honor it's an honor I'm gonna give you the last word but um I

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:56.359
want everybody to make sure that um you are following in whatever way possible

00:55:56.359 --> 00:56:03.000
uh Neil's Journey and the people that he is interviewing

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:11.160
it's makes for an interesting he I usually get upset when he when we talk about his episodes not with him but with

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:16.980
the responses and there's coming a day I'm going to try to be prophetic here

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:22.380
but there's coming a day when Neil will realize if he hasn't already that he's

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:27.599
gone beyond that he's in the into the thick now and the people back there

00:56:27.599 --> 00:56:34.260
they've really done that let me just say this I'm going to ask this last question let you have it and then we'll be done

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:39.900
um don't how do you look at these people

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:45.720
who are following the fairy tale do you look at them with pity do you

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:54.599
look at them with contempt um do you look at them as people that we need to you know to shake and say look

00:56:54.599 --> 00:57:01.920
this is this is what you're missing how do you look at these people who follows that Christian fairy tale

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:07.680
it's interesting because I honestly just I understand them I understand where

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:13.380
they're coming from I understand what's on their shoulders the weight that some of them have families and then they're

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:21.180
not like me where they can just go off and just coat and start saying stuff that I say so I instead of being mad or

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:28.380
trying to change them I take it on myself that it's my duty to bring this information and I'll talk to these I'll

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:34.319
talk to them and I'll ask them and I'll challenge them on certain things and I understand why they are why some of

00:57:34.319 --> 00:57:40.859
these people are the way they are I get it so it's on me I put it on myself to be the one to go forth with this

00:57:40.859 --> 00:57:46.020
information because this channel right here satanic initiation lady Babylon

this is a one in a million this is the most unique the most

00:57:52.319 --> 00:57:57.599
and it League of its own channel the information here you're not gonna get anywhere else and it's free nothing

00:57:57.599 --> 00:58:02.940
better than this this is I I'm way more honored to be on a show like this than I

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:07.980
am to interview some of these ivy league professors honestly I mean that I mean

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:13.800
that I'll say that a hundred times you could not say anything nicer than

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:19.079
that I really appreciate that Neil I think if you were sitting around with uh

00:58:19.079 --> 00:58:27.020
