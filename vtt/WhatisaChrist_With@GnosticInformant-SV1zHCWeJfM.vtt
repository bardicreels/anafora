00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.479
Christ what is the Antichrist what is the Christ if you have to know the Antichrist you have to know the Christ

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:30.240
right all right let's see it it's a Greek word for for applying a drug

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.880
to your eyes so that they may be

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.280
open that's what the Christ means in Greek yes the incredulity on the face of

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.360
this podcast host is warranted because that is pure and utter nonsense pure and

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.759
utter nonsense pure and utter nonsense pure and utter

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.080
nonsense oh all right wasn't that fantastic did you like the degrees on

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.400
the wall That's Dan and everybody give a hand give a hand to Dan because he's stepping up he's stepping up and he's

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:19.240
going to defend he's gonna show you tonight in the arena he's gonna show you exactly what his skills have enabled him

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.319
to do so around around for around for the

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:30.039
warrior Dan thank you Dan give me the next one

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:36.199
from the verbo to be stung by the gab

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:43.240
fly so as with many words in many languages the verbal rooto in ancient Greek can mean more than one thing

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.199
overwhelmingly it refers to rubbing with some kind of sticky fluid of some kind

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:56.120
either after bathing or for some kind of ritual purpose or something like that so to anoint be anointed anointing

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.280
something like that is going to take up the majority of the real estate for the

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.759
occurrences of this verbal root however it can refer to the sting of a gadfly but that is overwhelmingly in the

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:12.199
minority of occurrences of this verb and it's limited to classical and later

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:19.560
Greek lyrical poetry oh

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.800
SM oh did you did you taste that can everybody just can we relish this for a

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:32.639
minute look before we proceed come on man you know let me take the mask off you know here we are I'll put the axe

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:39.000
down here we go um first of all you have to admire the

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.599
distinguished uh you know confident self-confident boy this is a self-confident person I'd be willing to

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:51.639
say that that is a form of compensation you see I've played this game before and

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:57.000
I've given conferences and when I gave them in in England they said the London

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.199
Times said This research is last while Frontier of Classics so I've been there

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:10.199
I've been there and I know and it's a way of compensating and this is typical for Bible scholars Dan is a Bible

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:16.479
scholar all those plaques on his back wall in that prop up his bravado all of

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:25.319
those plaques are degrees in Bible studies um classical philologists laugh

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:32.680
they laugh at the um level of perform perance that Bible studies are able to

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:38.200
generate because people I just I'm going to tell you this now I'm going to give it and I promise tonight I'm gonna do

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:45.000
what Dan I'm gonna do what um um Dan needs to be done he needs to be shown um

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.160
the technique and what we're talking about is philology here um Bible scholars study theology they usually get

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.519
a couple of semesters of Greek and then they get like a semester of an

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:03.720
intermediate reading would they look at let's look at John right and then maybe

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:11.440
a letter of Paul in there whoohoo and then all of a sudden um they're shipped off to the theology department and um

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.640
given their hoo-ha now how do I know all of this because I used to teach a

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:23.760
seminary and when I taught there I increased enrollment from five different

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:32.920
dases yes yes and how was I able to do that because I was a classical philologist and I know what um training

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:39.079
is classical philologist when Dan was sitting in theology um Alan was sitting

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:45.200
in Greek reading Greek and that's really the issue tonight right these are this

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.760
is notice that this is a Greek term I'm bringing you right Christos what is that

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:58.600
Christos what is it what is it and Dan says Preposterous so let's see Dan

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:04.519
please this is such a great form and people we love Dan um let's give him

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:12.040
another let's give him some bit another couple of chances at wisdom and let's see what we can pull out of it go ahead

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:18.200
jwy give me the next one none of which has anything whatsoever to do with early Jewish or early Christian literature not

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:25.160
the sepagan not the New Testament not the early Greek literature the notion that you can just assert that sense for

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:33.079
any given occurrence just because it happens to be in the Lexicon is strongs concordance NASA means to

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:36.519
deceive levels of

00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:52.160
amateurishness amateur amateur you see what that is that's an amateur okay so remember

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:58.279
what's the context here I have told Danny Jones Danny Jones I had the

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:03.760
greatest day of my life was Danny Jones and Danny Jones said well God i' how

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.120
many times have I told him Christ

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.360
we're back are we back to Fantastic that was something I had a

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.720
really work up going you and I had something going and you didn't realize it I realized you were gone right oh

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.040
I've done that before um here we go are you ready here we go so what I'm doing

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:20.800
is look people I'm gonna tell you straight up I told Danny Jones and um as many people as have seen this now I told

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:27.560
them that Christ is a drug term yeah it's a pharmaceutical term right and

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:35.639
what we're going to do is we're going to watch Dan Dan we're g to watch him now step in

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:41.279
and say there is a difference between this person and this person this person's a Christian so the word they're

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:49.000
using it doesn't apply to their neighbor or their contemporary sources right it's very

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
um amateurish if you will yeah good word good word Dan you nailed it um hit the

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.040
last one neither the word EOS gadfly nor erania occur at all in the New Testament

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:10.839
uh or in early Christian literature this has absolutely no relationship whatsoever to the title Christos or to

00:13:10.839 --> 00:13:16.360
the verbal rooto this person is just making this all

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:32.120
up all right all right so here we go are you ready okay so um look by the way by

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:38.560
the way Dan you're you're I can hear modern Greek and what you're saying which is seminaries do this because they

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:44.519
do not teach Greek well but um you know I was telling everybody dan that in

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:49.720
school um that's what we do all the time you you got to read all the text in you

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:55.560
can't say that you're translator of Greek if if you only spend the time that

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:03.440
you spend on a little bit of New Testament a little bit of sep um and all of a sudden you know um all

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:09.279
of the experts around you in your environment Dan because Dan when you're reading this Greek there are all of

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:14.560
these great great great works that are being written in Greek that shine

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:20.880
tremendous light Dan they shine tremendous light on all of the other documents that are in their environment

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:29.680
because this is what classical philologist do Dan we don't need theology right it's a science a reason

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:36.320
is the number one thing Dan so watch this this is what I'm saying to you people we're done with Clips right chewy

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:43.240
um this is what I'm saying you don't know the difference between

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:49.240
Dan and me you don't know the difference he says it's this way I'm

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:55.040
saying it's this way who who who can tell who can tell well we know your

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.600
reason we know your oh did somebody want me to spank

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:08.519
oh now I am a slave I am a slave to you Satanist oh I love this come here come

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:16.320
here come here you know here let's just just pull down Dan just pull them down

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:23.160
just a little bit just a little D oh it's good see how flinchy

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:29.199
flinchy let's go oh God you got the Bic thing going on right from the beginning

00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:36.360
okay so before we put that up now here I'm just going to drop the bomb at the beginning of this whole thing and you

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:42.399

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:49.000
level of satisfaction right this is finishing during dessert you ever finished during

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.519
dessert oh God this is it here we go here we go are you ready oh oh oh oh

00:15:56.519 --> 00:16:03.839
what is the problem Dan the problem is is uh you're not

00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:08.959
looking at the sources right you're not looking at ancient medical sources

00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:16.759
you're not looking at any of the Contemporary lit I know you're not because I can tell I can track you from

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:23.399
the way that you handle Greek I can track you ready are you ready Dan okay pull it up give Dan it here we're giving

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:28.959
Dan the pharmacon are we gonna give Dan the pharmacon here you go here it comes

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:36.319
it's a drug Dan look at the top it's a drug whether healing or noxious oh who

00:16:36.319 --> 00:16:41.959
do they give us now what are you guys looking at here by the way this lexicon I saw you use the Lexicon Dan it was

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:47.360
like watching a person pick up a hammer for the first time or something um yeah

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.600
the authoritative you know this is not the authoritative text this is a tool

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:59.040
that the victorians develop those great classical Fist from 1850

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:06.280
right this is them this is aliceon wonderland baby so you got to respect it and how do you use this tool you got to

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.760
walk through the sources if you're walking the word through the sources you

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:19.480
can see how it is used over time and you can trace its semantic drift you can see

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:25.959
what happens to it oh it it's a history it's a history and it's oh it's so

00:17:25.959 --> 00:17:33.440
vibrant watch the drugs here people are you ready here comes the bomb look at paragraph number two healing Remedy or

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:39.160

EP oh God the look oh it just I don't know there's

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:05.240
you know there's a charm there's a charm there's a charm you know somebody's out

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:12.159
there right now making video video about um uh something I don't know something I

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:17.840
said I don't know uh it's probably not relevant but they're making it and it

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.760
just makes me wonder how do you justify if the language that you write in

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:30.760
ancient Hebrew it's got 8,000 unique words 8,000 how do you compete against

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:37.240
Greek that's got somewhere between 500,000 and 1 million to 1.5 million

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:43.480
they've estimated you know you can't count that kind of thing you can't count that thing your vocabulary that's

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:50.960
reaching for the Stars baby that's reaching for the Stars that's why do you see how

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:58.440
amazingly uh Superior ancient Greek is to the anglosaxon garbage that we have

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:04.360
to deal with that our brain is stuck in do you see it I can't get 1.5 million

Dan says now wait a minute wait a minute if Ides used it it cannot be used

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:07.400
by a Christian the same way because there is a wall of separation only in your false reality

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.080
Dan does something like that exist think about this Dan for a minute think about

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.760
it think about it classus sit around and they study all

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:24.080

of texts that we've got Dan do you know how many of those Are Walled off and

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:42.559
considered oh maybe out of time and space are they in a different dimension

on that next line down angone look at the look at the word following EP do you know what the

00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:00.559
difference is Dan you would if you read read the medical text but Dan doesn't

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:07.158
read medical text Dan says he knows Greek but he does not know

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:14.200
Greek and you're sitting there in the audience and you don't

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:20.240
know Dan can put on a face and can sit there and project to

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:28.640
you confidence and a guy like me can hear him and now he's full of it right

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:35.400

theology that's the academic disease of theology it really just takes up all the

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:55.960
space in the students brain and they can't grow with the

00:21:56.799 --> 00:22:03.120
Greek oh God I love it is this getting is this getting hot is this getting hot I'm

thumb and somebody's eye right um increas is an

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:50.720
ination going beneath the surface there's a it's a more aggressive form of

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:14.760
Dan said right there is absolutely this is just

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:20.720
absolutely crazy there is no connection between Christ and Drugs That's because

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:27.679
Dan has never read the text D I'm so sorry those those degrees those degrees

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:32.879

people like dioris Dan do you know that diores talks about Christ Dan does you

00:24:55.799 --> 00:25:01.320
know what he does of course he's talking about Christ because it is a

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:08.200
pharmaceutical operation the first Christ Dan was a

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:16.880
woman and she is the genius who figured out the mystery oh God Dan does that

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:22.039

more things um as we kind of as we kind of establish the Christ right what is

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:41.159
the Christ you have to also realize please realize everybody out there and I'm giving you this because a a lot of

00:25:41.159 --> 00:25:47.480
people here have given their time so for this so I want to honor you are you are

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:55.000
you ready um that first Christ is a woman and she Christ herself in order to

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.919
enter into a state of mania and then seeds to intoxicate um people around her

00:26:02.919 --> 00:26:10.240
to force them to enter that state it's active active possession active

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:15.360
possession fantastic okay let me get to the next one I want to I want to give

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.520
them a right hook here here comes the right hook Dan please hang in there Dan

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:27.880
I know it looks bad and I know I just showed you a reference to a text that talks directly about putting those in

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:35.360
the eyes but you know Dan there's a guy Das gordis in the first century he's got it all there Dan um you can find that

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:41.840
sometimes if you want you can go to lady Babylon you can look back because I've given references to dories and that kind

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:48.919
of thing I know you don't read them I know you don't read Paul of vagina I know you don't read gayin you may say gayin but you don't read gayin um I know

00:26:48.919 --> 00:26:55.120
that for a fact sorry but it's second sophistic brother and I can tell um what

00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:01.679
is this here this is the Enchanted potion or filter right this is the magic

00:27:01.679 --> 00:27:09.279
side of the pharmacon and the wall that Dan wants to erect and this is what all

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:18.640
Bible scholars do right um the Bible is special it is the inherent word of God

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:24.919
and it is special the Torah that is special right the New Testament that is

00:27:24.919 --> 00:27:33.399
special and these things cannot be dealt with in the manner that all of the other

00:27:33.399 --> 00:27:38.960
bits of the past can be dealt with it's a special attitude I'm going to erect

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.158
you they may have done that but we certainly

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:51.440
didn't that's the same attitude Dan that they gave me at my dissertation the head of the department

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:57.600
said the rans just wouldn't do such a thing just wouldn't do such a thing Dan

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.919
there's thousand thousand of pages of the Romans doing just such things and so

00:28:02.919 --> 00:28:08.600
I'm afraid to have to tell you this but Jesus was a drug user and he is crising

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.960
his own eyes oh God how's he getting that stuff

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:21.080
there remember Dan in the garden when the naked kid was with Jesus when he was arrested for him remember he had the

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:26.279
purple bandage on his you know the the medicated band let me say put it that

00:28:26.279 --> 00:28:32.240
way on his um yah right and um Jesus is being

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:38.679
administered um the rights having the purple through the impregnated

00:28:38.679 --> 00:28:45.399
linen uh under the pressure of the ejaculation of that naked kid right that

00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:53.760
is the Jesus Christ who has the drugs on board who is

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:59.559
able to enter into the mystery you mean this is all chemical mystery of course

00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:05.640
it is of course it is look at the words okay you're saying no you're still a not

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:12.120
and let me tell you something the word gospel how about if we just look at gospel the gospel you know what the

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:19.120
gospel is it's a word the doctors use wait what the gospel is medical term

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:25.960
yeah and guess what it's way older than the Christian usage the thing that you call the Christian usage it's way older

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:31.519
and it's been used over time what is it mean it means the power of bringing

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:38.640
Health that the concoction has so you have compound drugs and their gospel

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:45.679
their Evangelion or their EP angelion they use both um that that's the that's

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:51.200
the efficacy of the drug that you're taking that's the gospel oh really what

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:58.600
is salvation what is salvation Salvation is the state you enter

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:05.720
once you have the drugs huh okay fantastic and you mean

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:13.440
there are people who are using the terms just like that when Jesus Christ is walking around when Jesus Christ Dan is

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:19.840
walking around and he's you know he's like with that kid he's in the Garden of Gethsemane that kid's naked he's got

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:27.240
that bandage around his penis and he says oh my God the drippy

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:32.399
stuff is disgusting Ryan what is he's got that drippy stuff on his

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:37.440

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:43.799
um orgiastic or cult rights um that are involved with the mystery and always

00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:49.440

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:57.320
baptisms right those are about dies those are about dies did anybody know that did anybody know that Mary was 12

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:58.119

00:34:58.119 --> 00:35:05.119
Christ that ever existed do you think he was the first do you think he just popped on the scene in fairy

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:10.880
tale and there he is boom boom I'm a Christ you're what nobody knows what

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:17.040
that means because the first fraking time any of us have ever heard it

thank you for your patience thank you for your patience um we're getting through though we're getting through and

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:31.240
this week was all about getting through and I'm I'm really glad that I was able to do it and I want you people to see I

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:39.560
want you people to see so look I told you the name Christ it's about drugs now I just pulled out all the drug um uh

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:45.520
related material showed you the christing and different kinds of christing now you know why there's an

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:52.599
antichrist right which Isidor says is am which is cool but um there's a way um

00:36:52.599 --> 00:36:59.079
there's a there's a way to see the Antichrist now right what is the Antichrist it's an an anote to the

00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:04.960
Christ that's all it's an antidote to the Christ it's why Jesus the Christ

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:11.400
needed that naked boy you could not have had the Garden of Gethsemane if you did

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.599
not have a naked boy that naked boy was the source of the antidote which he is

00:37:16.599 --> 00:37:26.119
ejaculating into Jesus's mouth through a linen wrap that is impregnated with the

00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:32.000
burning purple and that's why when Luke says I don't know he's got this stuff it

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.920
looks like he's got sweat like blood you know it's that dark color it's because

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:44.720
he's involved in the right but it's drippy and slimy it's not the it's um um

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:50.800
it's not uh uh uh obviously it's something that he arrived at um from

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:56.720
struggles and you know etc etc I don't need to let you know the finer details

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:03.280
of what Jesus was doing to that naked boy that he was arrested with there's no reason for me to talk about that Dan

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:09.839
doesn't want to hear that kind of stuff um when Dan comes up and he says look I've got five books and these five books

00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:16.200
I'll say the septu agent was originally written in Hebrew for this reason and that reason right this is the same thing

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:22.599
the Bible scholars have done for the last oh I don't know maybe 1,500 years

00:38:22.599 --> 00:38:28.040
maybe 1500 very consistent very consistent people they always are

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:34.960
okay here's the problem and this is what the video the interview that Danny Jones

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:42.160
had um um this is what and by the way I had somebody um comment to me just today

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:48.400
um this was the best interview that I've ever given because it set things out

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:54.359
Danny was able to um keep me on some kind of linear thing and he Danny was

00:38:54.359 --> 00:38:59.560
like you know be direct bro right that uh that I really appreciate that I

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.680
really appreciate that and he read the chemical Muse right before then R does

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:10.200
his work bro right I'm I'm I'm exceptionally honored to have been able

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:16.040
to be involved and I thank you Danny I knew that you were going to get a lot of heat a lot of people are praying for

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:21.880
Danny do we have a picture of Danny Jones do we have a picture oh look at this I kind of get excited when I see

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:28.359
Danny blow that up I have like a good day I don't know what it is some people

00:39:28.359 --> 00:39:35.640
have yeah just I was trying to hide behind him does some people have this I

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:42.079
don't know he's got this thing I look at him I'm like yeah this is of the earth

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:47.200
you know what I mean this is strong this is this is going to last I like it get

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:55.520
him down get him down Danny um uh so look to be given the opportunity to

00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:03.079
expose people like this is perfect this is the sacrifice that we love these biblical Scholars will come in with this

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:10.839
very same bravado they always do until they find out what area you study and then they're like o right because

00:40:10.839 --> 00:40:17.599
everybody I'll tell you a secret everybody who studies who was ever been exposed to ancient Greek and this includes modern Greeks and I studied

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:22.640
with modern Greeks and I can tell you for a fact it is humbling ancient Greek

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:27.880
is humbling 1.5 million that's a

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:35.520
ton of unique words think of the brain power it takes to be able to produce that just following their tracks is

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:41.920
going to make all of us a lot smarter and it seems to do that consistently through history as it bubbles up through

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:48.079
the surface the more the more people open up that classical Greek all next thing you know there's Renaissance and

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:53.640
there there's whatnot now we can either have that Renaissance or we can very

00:40:53.640 --> 00:41:01.520
happily sit back and look at characters like Dan and we can say what are they doing um

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:07.040
I'm going to follow I'm going to I'm going to believe I'm gonna commit to you

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:14.119
my faith and I'm G to believe that the Romans just wouldn't do such a thing as

00:41:14.119 --> 00:41:19.520
drugs and I'm GNA believe in the fairy tale of Jesus

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:26.400
Christ who is not the guy who was arrested in a public park at 4:00 a.m. with a naked boy I'm going to believe in

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.760
a reality that is not the real and you and I know we can't do that

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:40.880
we can't do that that's why you're here is because you want the reality you value history you worship history and

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:46.599
you don't want the LIE please please understand I am not

00:41:46.599 --> 00:41:52.240
the only one in this Arena we're about to bring in um Gnostic uh informant who

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:57.880
was just renamed Gnostic Warrior by someone

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:03.319
um but we'll bring we'll bring him in we'll bring him in okay um make sure

00:42:03.319 --> 00:42:09.880
that we got I want to just end off with a couple of quotes here people you I always do this and people know it um oh

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:16.800
yeah here's your thimos what's Jesus what is Jesus giving to his people he's giving these death inducing drugs people

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:22.880
if you want to tell grandma what Jesus Christ was tell her she he was a guy who

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:28.480
was arrested in a public park with a naked kid and was h standing out at some

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.760

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.440
to the gospel that's okay we're going back to the gospel um and you'll notice

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.800
that there's an attachment there's a connection between the gospel and drugs right because what is it people that

00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:00.440
salvation is health and in Antiquity different times it changes and the drugs

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:06.119
change different regions change depends on what markets you can get but um

00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:12.920
there's a long tradition Antiquity of the drugs being the source of Health

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:18.119
right it's one of the major gayen says it's kind of the foundational branch of

00:43:18.119 --> 00:43:23.880
medicine is that drug work um love it love it oh God that stuff's gorgeous

00:46:20.839 --> 00:46:26.040
institutions institutions pump out people and um doesn't matter if their

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:33.040
training is good or bad bad as long as they're getting paid right that's what institutions do but they're

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:39.760
artists and there's discipline in that artistic community and it's those people

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:48.319
who end up bringing you the frontier it's those people um upholding the the

00:46:48.319 --> 00:46:53.640

00:48:18.599 --> 00:48:23.920
stuff excellent while you're gone I want to give my my my thoughts on the whole

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:29.720
Dan mlen situation Kip Davis all that stuff good good but I feel I feel like

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:34.920
it's fair that we do it separately because we don't what you say isn't necessarily I is my own opinion what I

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:41.960
say isn't necessarily your opinion we have our own thoughts yeah no I'm yielding to you the the platform now you

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:47.119
can it's your space and people should have that oh yeah it feels like a salon

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:55.960
and now number two is up okay I'm gonna shut up and bounce out go ahead Chey all right so first of all to get out to get

00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:03.200
the booze out of way because I'm going to I want to I have some some things some thoughts that I know that I'll get some booze for and some thoughts that I

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:09.720
know I'll get some cheers and laughs from so we'll get the booze out of the way who can get that out of the way my the booze that you guys all you guys all

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:14.760
throw your Tomatoes at me for this one but I thought Kip Davis did a diligent

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:22.960
and good job today at sticking to the text and uh looking at the evidence and

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:29.920
coming up with some good arguments I was especially happy to see him acknowledge

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:36.200
that scholarship is going into a direction uh he mentioned Jonathan Adler

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:43.760
he mentioned Gad Bera he mentioned um Russell gurin as in bringing out new peer

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:50.200
reviewed material and new ideas about how how how how late are these text or

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:57.559
how early are these texts the Hebrew Bible the Torah Genesis and he is acknowledging that it looks more and

00:49:57.559 --> 00:50:02.880
more likely that these are helenistic in the form at least in the form that we

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:08.559
have it today helenistic with roots that probably go back for however far we who

00:50:08.559 --> 00:50:16.480
knows I mean anything's possible in that sense I mean for example we talked about this on this channel before we have for

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:24.119
example before I even get into uh I just want to finish off the the kip thing before I get to Dan and we have in our

00:50:24.119 --> 00:50:30.000
possession what is called Nest store cup so let me share my screen real quick

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.240
if you don't mind um it is the this page Wikipedia

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:42.119
page now this is nestor's Cup right this is this is the this is the cup of Nestor

00:50:42.119 --> 00:50:50.960
what is that all right this is a 8th Century BC Greek alphabet cup and what is on it

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:58.480
is the name of a a character from Homer's Iliad all right

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:04.680
so we you can't find anything like this there's no cup with Moses's name on it

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:09.799
or Abraham's name on it you get stuff about the Kings and the princes and the

00:51:09.799 --> 00:51:14.920
all that stuff that no one denies is is legitimate historical but as far as

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:21.359
anything from like genesis or The Exodus or the flood of Noah there's nothing

00:51:21.359 --> 00:51:27.839
like this there is no cup that you could find look at this this is what it says in Greek I am the cup of n store good

00:51:27.839 --> 00:51:33.119
for drinking whoever drinks from this cup desire beautifully crowned aidite he will seiz him we have we have this

00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:38.359
dating so Homer Iliad we date it to when we find

00:51:38.359 --> 00:51:45.240
evidence of the text right does that make sense we don't just look if Homer was

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:51.920
saying I'm a guy living in 14,000 years ago we wouldn't just say oh it's dat to that time for some reason with the

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:58.319
Hebrew Bible that seems to be the that seems to be where everyone tries to go they're trying to find out if how far

00:51:58.319 --> 00:52:04.680
back can we go instead of actually just dating the text to where it goes letting the evidence fall where it falls finally

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:13.119
it seems like the tides are changing and people are because I've been asking this question for um at least two years now

00:52:13.119 --> 00:52:21.359
uh when I yeah I'll would say for for about two years now I've been asking the question who is citing Genesis before

00:52:21.359 --> 00:52:27.480
300 BC can someone just show me anybody mentioning citing it quoting from it

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:33.160
anything like that the prophets don't the prophets never do ever so I don't

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:38.839
know how you I don't know why it's taking so long for people to get come around that but kip but Davis came along

00:52:38.839 --> 00:52:44.880
and he gave his I thought he did good so there's all right throw your at throw your vegetables at me and all that stuff

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:50.000
get that out the way but I got some stuff for Dan though that that it's not

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:56.160
it's not looking good for Dan all right I got a video on the bottom let's play it and we'll talk about it hey everybody

00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:03.040
something keep in mind the next time you see people talking about what religion does and what problems it causes and

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:08.440
what religion is is that religion does not exist outside of our discourse about

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:14.079
it it is a conceptual category that we created it is a map and it is not the

00:53:14.079 --> 00:53:20.839
territory uh the creation of this category really began with medieval Islam and was taken up within the

00:53:20.839 --> 00:53:27.119
Renaissance the reformation and the enlight whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what you just

00:53:27.119 --> 00:53:33.040
hurt what just happened there you just I don't know if you noticed that but that

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:39.920
was a you just that was a thousand years you just skirted past like it was one year H is just something that was taken

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:46.599
up in the early medieval Islam and then renissance and the elment whoa what the hell was you have a time machine you

00:53:46.599 --> 00:53:52.400
just went from the seventh century all the way to the 13th 14th century and

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:57.440
then all the way to the seven 16th and what you just what are you doing how do

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:02.520
you just say that's so so nonchalant you know ter the thing called religion is

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:10.559
something that was just some random thing that you know just just a just Islam and medieval and whoa you just

00:54:10.559 --> 00:54:16.799
went through a thousand years right there that's a you can't just skirt past that like it was like a decade like you

00:54:16.799 --> 00:54:23.000
you can say that for like I don't know uh you know there was this one mystery called that sprung up in uh eph near

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:30.240
Ephesus and it was around for you know half a century or that's you could say that but like you can't just skirt past

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:35.839
a thousand years of time seventh century to the to the Renaissance all the way to

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:41.720
the enlightenment you've already you just passed through a thousand years all right let's continue I I'll get to why

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:48.040
this is uh that's not the really the bad part though the bad the reason why I'm bringing up this video is because his

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:53.720
criticism of Amon can be directly pointed at him for his Arguments for

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:58.960
what the term religion means I'll show you what and it was primarily a tool

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:05.520
that European Protestant Christians used to help them understand this new world

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:12.920
that they were discovering around them and so in many I kind of agree with that but I

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:21.599
don't we'll just let's Let It Rock for a second is not playing

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:35.240
did it freeze looks like it froze look at him

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:40.319
hey Dan he looks concerned in so in many ways all right you know what I might

00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:46.640
have to uh play this from a different player because I think it's not it's downloading on your end and it's fine I

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:52.559
can figure this out just bring it down I'll bring it back up in a second um it's it'll be no bit no problem I can I

00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:59.559
can fix this and I can uh we're just going to play the whole video through and not pause them anymore and I have uh

00:55:59.559 --> 00:56:05.880
and that's what we'll do all right let me say a song and dance while you prep that while you prep that are you ready

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:13.720
to go me yeah everybody something I'm ready to go okay go for it keep going all

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:21.440
right all right all so oh wait hold on I have to I have to remove this from the stage first all right um go ahead sing

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:27.000
your song and dance all right go ahead here we go people um the whole

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:33.640
thing that I I wanted to make sure people got um was that this is intentional

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:39.440
obfuscation right creating a false world where your people don't apply to the

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:46.680
people around you um this is a monest virus in the brain of humanity as soon

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:54.119
as the society goes monest you lose that classical wisdom and um outgo the

00:56:54.119 --> 00:57:00.440
libraries outgo the read out goes the discovery oh I'm getting there I'm getting there you'll see when

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:08.280
I there play this clip hold that thought because I'm going to get there this has to do with the the the very FB the very

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:14.000
definition of religion it's funny that this is the thing that he's talking about and basing a lot of his he had a

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.559
whole course on this and we seem to be on exact opposite ends of this and I

00:57:19.559 --> 00:57:25.599
think it has to do with a world this has to do with worldview in a lot of ways so what you just said is going to be it's

00:57:25.599 --> 00:57:32.119
going to end up being very crucial to all of this it has to do with you'll see

00:57:32.119 --> 00:57:38.799
actually I'm getting ahead of myself let me just let me play this clip and we'll go but something to keep in mind the next time you see people talking about

00:57:38.799 --> 00:57:44.640
what religion does and what problems it causes and what religion is is that

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:51.680
religion does not exist outside of our discourse about it it is a conceptual category that we created it is a map and

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:57.200
it is not the territory uh the creation of this category really began with

00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:04.359
medieval Islam and was taken up within the Renaissance the reformation and the Enlightenment and it was primarily a

00:58:04.359 --> 00:58:11.200
tool that European Protestant Christians used to help them understand this new

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:16.640
world that they were discovering around them and so in many ways our concept of

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:21.960
Religion Today can be reduced to an essence of whatever sufficiently

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:28.480
resembles Protestant Christianity and this is the way that Brent nongbri phrased it in his wonderful book before

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:34.559
religion uh and so when people talk about religion usually it's a conceptual

00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:39.640
proxy for Protestant Christianity it's an attempt to generalize from Protestant

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:45.079
Christianity to all other religions but we can't really Define religion in a way

00:58:45.079 --> 00:58:50.920
that is analytically useful this is a debate that's been going on for many years within the scholarship and we have

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:58.200
just not found a definition that reduces everything that is labeled religion to

00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:04.720
any kind of short list of necessary and sufficient features and that's because the concept did not develop with

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:10.400
reference to necessary insufficient features it is not learned and it is not used with reference to necessary

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:18.160
insufficient features uh and if you want to look at the scholarship that has been discussing this for many decades now uh

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:22.200
here are some things you can look up

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:44.720
let me can you hear me yeah this is the part that I want to focus on and finally

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:53.079
if you go to my link tree there's a PDF called religion and then in Brackets it says draft this is a draft of a chapter

00:59:53.079 --> 00:59:58.240
from my doctoral dissertation from several years ago that I ended up cutting from the dissertation I didn't

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:04.400
submit it because it was too bulky and it was unnecessary but the whole chapter is basically discussing the concept of

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:11.359
religion how it was created how people attempt to okay so this is the part that really got me going

01:00:11.359 --> 01:00:17.119
about all right so this is no no no wait wait can I can I just say I wanted to

01:00:17.119 --> 01:00:23.799
kill myself halfway into that yeah oh my God but this there reason I had to get

01:00:23.799 --> 01:00:29.160
to this part because I checked this this article this dissertation that he wrote

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:35.240
and he it seems like he was really okay I'm I'm just going to say this off the front and you're G I'm gonna I'm gonna

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:40.720
take you I'm gonna put my money where I'm out this and explain to you what why I think this he I don't think he went

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:47.520
into this looking blindly like a scientist would and gather and just let

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:53.480
the data decide the what the outcome was he went into this trying

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:59.480
to make try well maybe trying to argue with his dissertation was trying to find

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:06.720
the data that supports whatever argument he was making and he what he crit what he tried to criticize you for is

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:12.680
actually what he's doing here so I'm going to share my screen and this is

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:19.960
what I this is the dissertation right here so what this is what he does this is this is this was kind of crazy he uh

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:25.480
defines the word it's about the word religion remember he said he cut this from his dissertation so it didn't actually get into his dissertation but

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:31.480
he has it on his website um and he mentions it in that video now if you actually I'm not going

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:37.440
to read the whole thing but I really you know I would say if anyone's really interested read it why not see where I'm

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:43.480
at see where he's at let's then decide for yourself what what's going on here the part that really got me to want to

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:51.200
bring this up today in in context to why he's being a hypocrite for what he's saying about you is right around where

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.440
he decides to do an anemology of the word religion right here the purpose of

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:02.520
this section is to outline the process by which modern concept of religion is developed and he says I briefly outline

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:08.119
the process of reification as it is understood by Scholars today arranging discussion about the history of the

01:02:08.119 --> 01:02:15.079
eological origin of the English word religion in the Latin religio sever

01:02:15.079 --> 01:02:22.240
words appear to have been used in Greek and Latin Antiquity to refer to Concepts variously associated with the modern

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:31.119
notion of religion for example pus fides Le secta culus col thresia by the way I

01:02:31.119 --> 01:02:37.599
got to I got I got to do something first somebody sent me a a screenshot to

01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:42.839
right before this right before I went on with you someone sent me this screenshot and

01:02:42.839 --> 01:02:49.039
um first of all let me pull this up because I'm gonna put a we have to put a pause in this for a second I'm gonna

01:02:49.039 --> 01:02:54.839
come back to this dissertation but what just I have you H you're gonna you're gonna die when you see

01:02:54.839 --> 01:03:00.400
this I don't want to spoil your surprise but I see it coming yeah and you're

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:07.039
right you're right oh God keep going keep going bring it up so here is someone sent me this screenshot earlier

01:03:07.039 --> 01:03:14.079
to right before this is right before I got on with you and it's someone from it's a screenshot from a chat that was I

01:03:14.079 --> 01:03:22.039
don't know where I have no idea where this is from actually to be honest but it's funny because it's so typical Dan

01:03:22.039 --> 01:03:29.039
are you serious you think a person with four 4 degrees required ancient Greek

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:37.359
who spent almost 10 years supervising the modern Greek translation of the book of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and regularly visited Greece

01:03:37.359 --> 01:03:43.079
doesn't know the Greek are you honestly think that I mean he doesn't sound like

01:03:43.079 --> 01:03:49.200
that but that's my impression of someone who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talks like this like that is not an argument that's a

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:56.880
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know Maniac thing to say to somebody how dare you question my G

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:04.000
I spent 10 years supervising the modern Greek translation of the m and Bible

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.240
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you dude you sound like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] douchebag okay okay okay reason why reason why I had to bring this up yes he

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:17.599
does this all the time he just waves his credentials at everything every he'll have a video he'll have he'll he'll

01:04:17.599 --> 01:04:25.960
beking a video yeah he'll just say this is utterly false and Preposterous and um

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:33.680
here's 10 books that I never read or you're never going to read that agree with me on this but he won't he'll just assert he he does a lot of assertions he

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:39.520
never really gives arguments notice this he did this with you in the first video

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:46.559
yeah the one not the Christ one what was the first one about again oh God I don't remember translation the Greek trans can

01:04:46.559 --> 01:04:51.599
I say though Neil let me interrupt let me interrupt because I don't want I don't want to miss this I'm flowing but

01:04:51.599 --> 01:04:59.400
go ahead look at the no you're flowing and I don't want to interrupt it but look he regularly visited Greece somehow

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:06.920
he thinks his walking around modern Greece is gonna allow him to absorb

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:12.640
Homer and pendar I don't know I don't know you're smoking guy You're gonna

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:18.640
laugh when you see this You're gonna laugh and you see this because in that dissertation oh first of all I gotta say

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:24.400
this first when he the first video he did about you I give it a zero I I'm

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:31.200
giving I told him I I told you I told you Kip Kip did great today I give Kip I I don't even give any Kip Kip got a

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:36.559
hundred in my eyes I I know you you could disagree with that I'm just saying I lik Kip's video today thought the

01:05:36.559 --> 01:05:42.680
energy was good and I thought it was great Dan's first video against you

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:47.760
zero zero you want to know why he gets a zero he didn't give any arguments all he

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:53.599
did was say nuh and here's five books that no one none of you are ever going

01:05:53.599 --> 01:06:01.079
to read and I'm just going to Gaslight the whole public and make them think that they're I'm right because I have a PhD bro that's not an argument that's an

01:06:01.079 --> 01:06:07.520
assertion and it's nothing at the end of the day we're back at square one because all you you're making an assertion and

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:13.640
by the way you gave arguments you gave multiple words the Theos saase thing that was a good argument I thought it

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:20.039
was very convincing thease is a technical term in Greek it it comes in the Hebrew in two different words I

01:06:20.039 --> 01:06:26.319
thought that was a good argument Dan didn't do anything like that by the way Kip actually did give some examples he

01:06:26.319 --> 01:06:31.520
said the word pasca a couple other words he gives some arguments [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah let's do that that's what that's what this is

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:39.359
supposed to be about bring an argument Dan didn't bring [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all Dan did is say nuh nuh here's five books that No One's

01:06:39.359 --> 01:06:44.400
Gonna read all right anyways let's put that aside for now okay let me say Let

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:49.640
me say something let me say something I just want you to know that in that

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:58.960
second clip that you show to him where he was babbling on about religion I swear that is a hypnotic drug um that

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:04.720
religion departments have developed over time it's a logos that they use to lull

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:09.880
well it luls me into like you know first it migrates and then it makes me sleepy

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:15.960
I don't know why but but you have to understand too that

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:22.400
there is a lot there is a lot of bad work there is a lot you don't understand

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:28.760
it if you don't understand the lingo you don't understand that when one scientist has really gone

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:36.359
wrong and the others are all trying to correct them that's the problem with the theology people is that they have to

01:07:36.359 --> 01:07:43.480
prop up that that um theology can can you just tell me Neil really quick SBC

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:49.039
is what explain that to me again SBC yeah yeah what is

01:07:49.039 --> 01:07:56.000
SBC you mean whatever it Dan associated with it

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.760
Society of one of his prestigious groups they suck they they're try their the

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:06.799
whole point of them is just to I mean they'll they they if if the facts are

01:08:06.799 --> 01:08:14.200
brute they they go they have to like their whole thing is like what can we get away with how how early can we date

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:20.480
the text let's see how early let's try to get to the Iron Age let's try to get it there there that's what they're doing

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:25.798
you could just so obvious they're trying to please all the Christians and they're trying to sell Christianity to Li

01:08:25.799 --> 01:08:32.480
audiences but the bible really isn't that anti-gay guys it's really not it's really actually really Progressive no

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:38.560
it's not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucks all right and it's and it's dated to the helenistic period as you're gonna find

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:44.880
out but my when I drop my when I drop my my video with Gad Barna we'd blow it out the water for two and a half hours

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:50.159
anyways pull up my screen please so okay so the reason why I wanted to show you

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:55.758
that his little I how dare you question my Greek skills because right here

01:08:55.759 --> 01:09:02.440
there's a word in Greek you see that word let me see if I can zoom in a little bit so everybody can see

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:09.040
it you see it thresa what is that it looks like it

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:14.359
looks like thresa but I don't know I'm not I'm not really sure and then I'm thinking to

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:20.318
myself maybe it's a coin version of some word maybe it's a different version of

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:25.480
the word thresa that I'm thinking of because that's that that's a word for religion right and I asked my friend who

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:32.880
knows modern Greek is this how you spell it in modern Greek he said no check this out ready I'm going to come back to

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:40.400
this and I gotta go back to I gotta go back to my other folder

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:48.600
just give me a second all right so back to this folder right look if you put that word into the

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:54.800
any lexicon this is percus tus this has percus tus has all the lexicons rolled into one that's why we call it Alice

01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:00.280
baby no information found that's not a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] word dude you spelled it wrong

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:07.560
oh how dare you question my Greek bro you spelled thresa wrong it's not a word

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:17.080
you don't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Greek spelled it wrong dude here's how you really spell it with an all right so what does it

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:23.600
mean it means religious worship Now isn't that funny isn't that funny that

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:30.800
this word means religious work worship that's how it's used in Greek you see you got heraus

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:37.600
twice um EP what is this uh you got the book of Acts uses it

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:43.400
Ephesians uses it uh so Christians are using this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of this word huh why

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:49.880
wouldn't we talk about this word all right let's just put this aside for now let's go back to the article if you

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:55.800
don't mind all right getting all fired up over here so

01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:03.080
back to the article this is what he's saying here he says this you spelled the word wrong but he's

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:08.880
saying all those word Elia which is another word we use that translate to

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:15.120
religious or Pious or you know religious all right he says this is what he says

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:21.560
he just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] says for example all of these words that we use for that that

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:27.760
that um all these words that I just named that form the basis of the meaning

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:35.360
of the English word religion just ignore all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because I am just going to focus on this one Latin word

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:42.040
religio right so he's only gonna focus on this word religio but not only that this is

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:51.520
what he does this is where this is why he's a hypocrite for calling you out he decides to use three

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:58.719
examples of the word religio used by platus he uses the word platus Julius

01:11:58.719 --> 01:12:05.080
Caesar and cisero while lcre lcus pejoratively

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:13.159
described it as a synony okay so maybe four but Mo mostly three he's saying okay cisero you

01:12:13.159 --> 01:12:20.760
religio is a virtue that was contrasted with superstitio for Caesar it's an obligation of an oath right okay plotus

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:27.800
uses his word he calls me back directly and invites me to dinner I had Scruples religio and I could not decline so like

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:35.840
Oaths and uh obligations right super and then cero okay he uses these three why

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:42.920
are you cherry-picking those three when you just criticize Ammon ready for this

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:50.080
here is the percus tus so we're using Lewis and short lexicon here's the word

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:56.280
religio and look how many times it's used for reverence for the Gods

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:04.040
look at this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:11.800
13 14 15 16 17 18 19 why didn't you talk about any of those usage of the word why

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:19.400
did you just pick three cherry pick three random usages of the word now I get what

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:26.080
you're trying to do you're trying to show look the word religio was used in different context during in the ancient

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:34.120
world we don't use the word religion the same way they do that's because religion is English and religio is Latin and the

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:42.800
reason why this is a stupid argument is because you wouldn't do the same thing for scientia centia the word science comes

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:49.320
from the Latin word centia which means knowing or being skilled in anything

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:56.199
knowledge right here's a cisero right ciso I'm let's go with ciso he wants to talk about ciso let's talk about C right

01:13:56.199 --> 01:14:00.560
C uses the word right here he

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:06.800
says I suck attin

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:13.880
Max all right now if you look if you check this with this you know I'm being honest I'm I'm not a Latin guy but I

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:19.960
know what this translates to I can look it up because other people have done it before me it says either we know nothing

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:25.320
about such things or even if we know them thoroughly we cannot be better or

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:30.600
happier because of that knowledge basically Cenas is the Latin word for

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:36.199
the is the Latin version of the Greek word nosis it means knowledge that's it

01:14:36.199 --> 01:14:42.440
we use the word science way different than the Latin uses the word

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:48.639
cenat right but why isn't why where's Dan at trying to tell everybody we

01:14:48.639 --> 01:14:54.719
shouldn't use the word science anymore because it doesn't mean what it used to mean right because that that's not a

01:14:54.719 --> 01:14:59.800
worth that's not a worthy dissertation because it's not it doesn't do anything because nobody would care everyone would

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:07.600
just ignore it but the fact of the matter is this this is stupid dissertation anyways because this is

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:14.000
actually a fun funny thing that happened it's very it's very uh comedic it's very what happened with this is actually very

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.400
hilarious so there was actually a time where Dan tried to police the usage of

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:26.639
this word on the internet so let me share my screen one more time I have another screenshot this happened a while

01:15:26.639 --> 01:15:34.800
ago there was a debate between a Christian and David McDonald was pretty good debate and um I was in the chat and

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:40.520
I decided I said look for once I agree with the Christian here I said religion

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:47.280
has the Public Service of giving people an outlet to grieve loved ones who pass away this is something I don't think

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.840
anyone can disagree with and then this is that's wait a minute he just used the

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:57.960
word religion and in a context that I don't agree with I got to police the internet

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:05.080
now and he says religion doesn't exist outside of discourse so it's not doing anything at all and then the funny part

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:10.400
about this is uh wrong way funny part about this is two seconds

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:16.040
later um people other people in the chat are using the word religion religion isn't a direct correlation to a lower

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:21.679
aggression we don't see higher aggression and the Ember disagree with me politely I don't think religion let

01:16:21.679 --> 01:16:27.000
alone any specific religion should get credit for human grief that's part of human being now listen we all know what

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.880
they mean by that none of us are thinking in ourselves well uh Cicero

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:38.840
would have used the word religion difference so Ember you shouldn't have said it that way you should change whatever you said to worship of the gods

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:44.080
or something no because that's incoherent that's not how language Works

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:50.760
people we decide how we determine what words mean and and words change over

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:57.040
time right now when I say the word religion people know what I mean by it they don't think that I'm talking about

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:02.600
an obligation for like Caesar used it they think I'm talking about worship of

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:09.679
certain Gods attending a certain church or a synagogue or a Buddhist temple people know what religion means because

01:17:09.679 --> 01:17:16.159
that's how we use it now I have one more thing that I want to

01:17:16.159 --> 01:17:23.840
present um oh a couple things actually beautiful beautiful text from my boy

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:30.560
here speaking of the Renaissance because I think this this word is very uh well

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:35.920
well defined in my opinion and I disagree with what Dan's trying to do with this word I think his dissertation

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:42.320
sucks I think the way he tries to redefine words by going back to the ancient past and trying to bring the

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:49.840
context of what they talked about in the ancient past into today's uh world is is dumb I don't know what it doesn't have

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:55.480
any it just doesn't seem useful at all um people when we say monotheism M we

01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:02.080
know what that means we know there there is no pure monotheism anywhere even Islam isn't really purely monotheistic

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:08.600
there's Jin there's Spirits there's the devil hasatan all that stuff we know we know there's no pure monotheism but we

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:15.440
know when you say monotheism you know what it means we know it means that there's one Eternal Creator who's

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.040
perfect and infallible and and all the spirits are Bel that's what monotheism

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:27.520
means let's not play and I'm going to get back to that in a second my boys Brun broy and

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:34.600
Flavio from the 14th and 15th century along with makavelli and

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:40.000
petrarch this is who I this is what who I've been reading in the last couple days or last couple weeks right now I'm

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.639
right now I'm in Flavio uh Bond uh Bondo Flavio he's I'm

01:18:45.639 --> 01:18:52.400
reading him right now because I'm working on a video and I'm actually glad this all happened between Almon and Dan

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:57.440
because I I I'm make I was originally making a video dealing with some of the

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:04.080
stuff that I disagree with Dan on but I'd rather do it here because this video is turning into a really deep anthropology video that I'm working on

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:09.880
it's going to be a big documentary about what is religion and I couldn't I I found the

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:17.719
most beautiful beautiful definition of religion from a Renaissance writer who

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:25.639
used by the way petrarch Flavio and broy broy and um makavelli they all use the

01:19:25.639 --> 01:19:33.000
term Dark Ages to refer to the the period between 500 AD and a th ad and

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.960
the reason why they that the scholars today hate that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think Dan's one of those people who hate that who fight

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:44.320
against that and then no that's a that's incorrect Dark Ages it wasn't really that dark it was actually pretty bright

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:49.480
no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I agree with the Renaissance people I agree that it was dark ages and there's only one reason

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:55.199
why I don't care about technology I don't care about logistics I don't care about how cool their churches look

01:19:55.199 --> 01:20:02.520
I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about how beautiful they have a crucifixes and all that stuff there was no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] text no

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:08.400
classical literature between 500 and a thousand zero you cannot compare cisero

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:15.000
you cannot compare uh you cannot compare oid and Virgil and Homer and Plato and

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:21.280
Socrates and hpaa and and safo you can't compare them there's no there's no

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:28.320
comparison to all those amazing brilliant thinkers and writers of the classical Antiquity compared to anyone

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:35.120
between 500 and a th000 ad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Dark Ages bro period facts and so this dude

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:41.840
says this so well this is what he says religio nonius marccelus writes is

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:47.600
the worship of the Gods according to Plutarch in the life of amelus paus the

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.639
philosophers and all other ancestors defined it as knowledge of divine

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:58.120
matters all as Gus said says that Marcus Cicero in a speech on the appointing of

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:06.000
a prosecutor maintains that shrines full of majesty and awe are called religiosa and sabinus thinks that

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:11.719
religiosus is what which because of some quality of Holiness has been removed and

01:21:11.719 --> 01:21:18.920
set apart from us the term being derived from leaving behind Rel lener sish or

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:25.920
servia sish supicious thought that religiosus is that which because of some

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:33.960
quality of Holiness has derived its name from to remove and pompus Festus says religiosi

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:39.000
are those who distinguish between the things that are to be done and the

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:47.120
things that are to be avoided now that is a good atmology dig for religion done

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:52.560
a how many years before Dan did it 800 years before Dan did it and it's not

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:59.080
Enlightenment and this is before the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh uh Protestant Reformation so

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:05.440
this is already these ideas are already way before the Protestant Reformation nothing to do with that and by the way

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:13.400
all and Dan is actually Dan is making this weird argument that this term religion only s somehow somehow helps

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:19.800
Protestant Christians in the Modern Age and he says in his article it says only for like white males for specifically

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:25.560
which is weird uh that's in the article you'll see that but the term for

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:31.440
religion in Arabic is widely used in the same

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:37.800
context that we it's called Dean d i i n or however it's spelled in Arabic Dean

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:45.400
and that's the term that we would translate into English as religion and it's used in the exact same context so

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:50.760
you're you're actually what you're doing is you're taking the context away from

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:56.320
the whole world basically and just saying and just trying to hone in on these one little group of people as if

01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:02.280
it only helps them I think you're I think you're putting your politics into this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] too much dude I don't I don't

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:07.480
find that a fair argument okay I'm gonna bust in because

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:14.920
I want to make a comment yeah and I need to say that um chewy is very quick on

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:21.639
the trigger and was trying to shoot somebody in the chat and missed and hit

01:23:54.560 --> 01:24:00.840
all right sorry I want to say about what you were just doing Neil first of all it was a little hard to watch it was a

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:05.960
little hard to watch I got to admit I mean I took my turn you took your turn

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:13.679
and boy by the end of it it must be sore it must really be sore what I saw you do

01:24:13.679 --> 01:24:21.199
was what a good dissertation committee will do right you have to get that

01:24:21.199 --> 01:24:26.239
dissertation to the raw point of perfection and somebody who's going to

01:24:26.239 --> 01:24:32.679
step up put some Greek up there and misspell it that's you know come on man

01:24:32.679 --> 01:24:40.440
especially especially when you get that you get that offended about how great your Greek is that you for 10 years um

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:46.520
yeah right did I tell you about the back and forth that I had when I I uh with him on

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:53.239
X on Twitter tell me about the back and forth all right can can I can I just throw a couple more screenshots oh yeah

01:24:53.239 --> 01:25:00.400
no I'm out I just wanted pop in for a second this is funny people are gonna like this because I I brought some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:07.239
to him on on Twitter that he just had to stop listening he had to stop replying because he he knew he tapped out it was

01:25:07.239 --> 01:25:12.600
game over for this dude so you know I follow Dan I you know I learn I actually

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:18.440
learn a lot from Dan mlen Believe It or Not uh especially on the Hebrew Old

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:24.080
Testament stuff I want to know I'm trying to learn as much as I can from everybody but I noticed something oh

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:29.880
this is is the wrong slide all here it is Dan

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:37.080
mclen there was a post where he uh I have it screenshotted here somewhere um sorry about that let me

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:42.760
just um did I really not save it oh here we go okay I got it now so

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:49.320
Dan mclen was refuting a Christian and the Christian made this

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:54.880
point and I thought this was kind of dumb at first I just didn't know understand what what the argument was

01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:01.480
some Christian named Chris cougler said that Paul didn't believe in only of course Paul didn't believe in only one

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:07.639
God but he did believe in a cosm cosmogonical first principle that was distinct from all other reality not in

01:26:07.639 --> 01:26:13.960
degree but in kind now Bravo to you Chris because you read

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:20.320
the sources and maybe he doesn't maybe he just got lucky I don't know but if you read the sources you would know that

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:26.360
that was the dominant philosophy in the first century under the middle platonism

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:31.800
of the day middle platonism for those who don't know was the leading

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:38.199
philosophical dominance of thought all over the Mediterranean which combines

01:26:38.199 --> 01:26:43.440
Plato's philosophy of the demiurge the perfect God who created

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:49.638
everything mixed with the stoic logos who's also

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:57.400
a monistic maybe even uh yeah monistic God they sometimes they

01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:04.520
call the Noose the mind or the AR the first it comes from the presocratic comes from Athens baby now if you don't

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:10.480
read [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the classical sources you wouldn't know this and I this is Dan showing off that he doesn't know

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:16.239
classical sources because this is I'm I'm telling you just I I wish I can

01:27:16.239 --> 01:27:21.960
describe this better if if if you know you know but a man you never you ever you ever heard someone try to just like

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:27.360
explain I don't know Star Wars or something and they pretend to be an expert in Star Wars but then they say

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:33.080
like Jaba the hoot and they say or they say like some name wrong or something and or they get something wrong that's

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:38.960
so like so sophomoric it's like wait did you even watch that movie you how did

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:45.520
you not even know this that's what Dan's doing right here this is on Full display because any Anyone who reads the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:51.199
text from the first century or the first century BC or the 2 Century BC or the

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:57.400
third Century BC even in the fourth Century BC you will find in theologians and

01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:05.639
philosophers there's an idea of an AR the first the one the monad as the uh as

01:28:05.639 --> 01:28:11.000
he's described in the uh in the uh calan

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:17.719
oracles The monad Who splits his diad into two becomes a Triad and this is

01:28:17.719 --> 01:28:23.760
influencing trinitarian theology now I am I just am I just connecting the two because I feel like it no we have

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:30.320
Christian sources called The valentinians Who were prominent in the first half of the second century who

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:37.119
believe that Christ and Zoey logos and Zoey as in John one describes if you

01:28:37.119 --> 01:28:44.760
read it in the Greek Dan should know this if you read the John 1 in the Greek you get Theos creates the world through

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:51.360
a logos who splits off a diad as zoei life that's translated into life the

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:57.480
valentinians argu that that's a Triad in the in the Pythagorean sense and he was

01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:03.440
charged by hippitus in the late 2nd Century with plagiarizing

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:09.600
Pythagoras this is how we know this is our Greek ideas anyways so Dan comes along and

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:15.960
thinks this is a retroration of laner philosophical Frameworks onto Paul's writings for instance it presupposes

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:21.600
creation X niilo huh which is an ideology that wouldn't be created until

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:30.480
over a century after Paul's death people need to think more critically about what monotheism is now this is strange

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.600
because the guy didn't even say anything about monotheism and he didn't say he didn't

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:41.119
even say anything about creation from nothing which is what Creo creation xne

01:29:41.119 --> 01:29:47.639
Hill is which is a it technically is a Doctrine from uh theophilis of Antioch

01:29:47.639 --> 01:29:55.159
in the in the late second century which is what Dan probably read somewhere and just asserted that that's that's got to

01:29:55.159 --> 01:30:01.679
be the only time it just it vented from thin air like n there's no ideas that preceded just this guy was a genius just

01:30:01.679 --> 01:30:08.840
out of thin air invented this new doctrine but it's such a weird thing to to say to this guy so okay so uh I have

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:14.320
my things backwards you just got to um here we

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:20.400
go so I come in and uh somebody somebody asked Dan

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:27.040
mlen they go hey Dan isn't it possible that ex niilo was I think they said something

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:33.600
along the lines of like not necessary for the for Paul or there could be similar ideas to this some he said

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:39.719
something like that I didn't have that part screenshot I don't really care what the person said but Dan's response was anything is possible but the

01:30:39.719 --> 01:30:45.880
overwhelming consensus I hate when he says that the overwhelming consensus is not an argument by the way it's an

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:52.760
assertion but the overwhelming consensus is that the Christians developed it in the late 2nd Century during debates with

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:59.440
gnostics and other Greek thinkers whoa that's a really sophomoric phrase right

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:05.320
there debates with gnostics what what did I just what what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do you not

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:10.960
know Christian history not debates with gnostics what is this like 1940

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:17.119
scholarship right here we're I thought we're way past the Gnostic thing because that's a first of all that happened in

01:31:17.119 --> 01:31:22.560
the early seconds early early 2 Century not the late second century and they're not gnostics they're just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:27.920
Christians we call them gnostics they called them gnostics later so all there's so much wrong in what he just

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:35.600
said there so much wrong in what he just said there so I come in this is what I said anything's possible how about maybe

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:40.639
read the primary sources and check this is laughably wrong in order to be this

01:31:40.639 --> 01:31:46.880
off one must have gone their whole PhD career without reading any primary sources of the theologians and

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:53.960
philosophers of the time of Paul just because theophiles of Antioch was the first to articulate this as ctio X nilo

01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:59.119
in the60s does not mean that he just invented it from thin air this is

01:31:59.119 --> 01:32:06.159
typical of middle platonic theology a combination of the stoic logos with Plato's demiurge easily found easily

01:32:06.159 --> 01:32:12.000
found you could just find S sources all over elen is a big Source uh plutar talks about anyway I'll just keep

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:19.320
reading uh and even in some degree going back easily found in the writings of Philo his first century BC writer and

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:24.920
first century CE writer he's he's in he's at the turn of the century uh writings of five and other middle plate

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:31.360
inness and even in some degree going back to Plato's tus everyone if by the way if you haven't read Plato's tus

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:38.520
don't call yourself a scholar of religion don't call yourself a SC a the a theology major stop call yourself

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:43.880
something else because if you haven't read if you don't know Plato tus then you don't know the whole roots of of

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:50.000
Western Theology of of you don't know the roots of monotheism at all you need to just stop you need to go back to

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.639
school and let me finish this off before you say something on that all right as the idea develops over the course of

01:32:55.639 --> 01:33:01.000
many centuries just looking up when was ctio x nio a Christian doctrine doesn't

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.400
explain where this idea comes from and Paul's theology was certainly influenced by midal platonism by the way you could

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:16.440
tell not just by how the way you could tell by the way uh Paul's ideas and Paul's Paul's aesthetic Paul's um Paul's

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:22.560
morals all middle platonist all of it and also debates with gnostics that

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:27.840
happened in the early second Cent Cy not late 2 century and nobody called themselves gnostics they were just

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:33.679
Christians with various beliefs some emphasis on nosis in some of the groups this whole post sounds uninformed in

01:33:33.679 --> 01:33:40.040
many ways now before you say something if I was to make a list of all the the

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:50.000
major Gnostic thinkers all of them are dead by 160 Mar uh um marcion

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.719
valentinus the kpoc crates basilides most of them are dead before the second

01:33:55.719 --> 01:34:02.199
century even started saturnus Mark Simon megus uh most of them are dead most of

01:34:02.199 --> 01:34:10.960
them didn't even make it to the second century they're all first Mo the roots of it is first century they're all dead by the year 150 144 160 so it's like

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:18.080
wait a minute how many of these people came back from the dead Dan to debate with to debate the Earth creation ex Neo

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:24.520
that's you don't know what you're talking about all right did you want to say something I just wanted to say

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:30.239
congratulations for um Towing you know the line over it's not

01:34:30.239 --> 01:34:38.159
over yet get worse you know what I mean no but I I think it's important to realize look what you're doing you're taking a critical look at the work and

01:34:38.159 --> 01:34:43.639
you're doing it from the perspective of those sources um I'm I just want you to

01:34:43.639 --> 01:34:50.320
know I'm I'm digging your work this this is where the gas lighting comes in this is where the typical Dan comes in

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:58.159
typical how dare you how dare hey I'm a Mor Dan comes in after after I just

01:34:58.159 --> 01:35:05.360
threw all the primary sources down his throat he comes in and says I've read the primary sources many times which I

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:11.480
can tell he hasn't because he wouldn't have said that just straight up fact doesn't follow that's not logic you

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:16.719
wouldn't have said what you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] said if you read the primary sources duh I've

01:35:16.719 --> 01:35:24.840
read the primary sources many times and I'm representing the overwhelming consensus the overwhelming consensus

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:31.400
you can check out May HBL Winston V Goldstein and more recently even andon

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:36.440
and Brick Mill to read about the primary sources that you've

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:42.600
misread to be promotion promoting creation by the way I never promoted a creation X Neo you're the one that

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:49.760
brought that up I just said you don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] need it dummy all right before I even checked

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:56.520
any of those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] names that he threw at me in attempt to Gaslight I didn't care because I know I I know the primary

01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:02.239
sources and they didn't change because you just threw some books at me they're still there and they still say the same

01:36:02.239 --> 01:36:07.360
things Dan that's how history works it's stuck Frozen history doesn't change we

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.639
can play definition games and nothing changes in the past except how we look

01:36:12.639 --> 01:36:18.040
at it so here's what I said listing a bunch of Scholars names in some attempt

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:23.080
to Gaslight does not somehow erase the primary sources like Plato aristobulus

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:30.239
pho AR in forming groups like The Hip sterian with concepts of an eternal perfect Creator just as Plato talks

01:36:30.239 --> 01:36:36.320
about Inus and this was present in Middle platonism long before CIO X nilo was an

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:41.800
official Doctrine again ctio XO wasn't invented from thin air it was preceded

01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:48.199
by these doctrines and I know this because I read the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sources from the primary sources you

01:36:48.199 --> 01:36:54.960
don't read Dan the comment you tried to refute was not about ctio xilo became a

01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:00.159
Doctrine in Christianity the comment was about what Paul believed about God and

01:37:00.159 --> 01:37:06.520
you can't say that these ideas came later that would be admitting that you are not aware of the

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:11.719
sources then I went and looked first book he so he so he he gave me May was

01:37:11.719 --> 01:37:17.040
the first one and I you know let's see Maybe I'm Wrong maybe Mr PhD with his

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:23.280
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 10 years of teaching Greek maybe he's right and I'm wrong let's see let's read the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that he gave me to

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:28.600
read the first [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] page I open up was a

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:36.880
literally about literally mentions all the sources that I mentioned it mentions Pho it says is it the he opens up a

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:42.719
question is it true that Pho already had something similar to cretian X nilo in

01:37:42.719 --> 01:37:48.880
the first century BC we're going to talk about that and then it says oh of course we have to talk about play's tomus as

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:54.080
well all of it was right there in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] first page I couldn't believe it

01:37:54.080 --> 01:38:00.520
so I I had I had to come back to Dan 24 hours later I came back to Dan I said Dan after checking into some of the

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:07.280
names you listed the real question is did you read them may immediately begins

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:14.199
to discuss Plato's tus and the question of did Philo already teach creation out of nothing and how Plato's was

01:38:14.199 --> 01:38:20.840
interpreted by bilities first century Christian not late second century Christian you're off by about a 100

01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:26.599
years there interpreted by facilities by the way the Magus archon that's a braxus

01:38:26.599 --> 01:38:34.440
baby first second century Christian the logo the logo of my channel that's a braxus that's the megas archon he's the

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:41.000
Eternal perfect God that created everything you cannot say that you don't need there's no requirement for ctio

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:48.679
cretian xilo by basil for Basil's Doctrine he already has it there it's in the sources read hippius read uh

01:38:48.679 --> 01:38:53.880
ireneaus a first second century Christian he even has a chapter about

01:38:53.880 --> 01:39:00.239
theop theophilos of Antioch who he says is responding to these ideas nothing so

01:39:00.239 --> 01:39:07.520
far suggests that the idea of a single perfect Eternal Creator requires the doctrine of creation X niilo you can

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:14.520
reject Pho and Plato as holding to you can reject that Pho and Plato hold an identical Doctrine to of Cen creation X

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:21.040
Neo but you still can't reject that Eternal perfect one is not something already dominant by Paul's time this is

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:26.360
so bad this is when I decided I got to this is to make a video I got because you know Dan you can you can go after

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:31.639
low lwh hanging fruit Tik toks all day long but as soon as someone comes along

01:39:31.639 --> 01:39:38.199
and challenges you you get quiet because he because he never responded to that last post about when I said bro you were

01:39:38.199 --> 01:39:44.119
wrong and I was right the sources he never responds to that he's done talking to me after that but one of his um

01:39:44.119 --> 01:39:51.800
colleagues Jason Staples who's a big-time biblical scholar big-time biblical scholar he came along jumps out

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:57.560
of the woodwork and says Dan I am exceedingly unpersuaded by that

01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:02.760
last statement what is the evidence that Christian monotheism the by the way

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:08.800
everyone knows what he means by that so who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how you define this word I knew what he meant by that the

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:16.639
idea that the Christian God is the high God qualitatively different from everything else requires ctio X niilo it

01:40:16.639 --> 01:40:22.400
certainly isn't logically syllogistically required so his own colleague comes in and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] checks

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:27.960
his ass and so Dan Dan does respond to him but not me he says the enlightenment

01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:33.199
Christians who coin we're already we're already back in the enlightenment again the enlightenment Christians who coined

01:40:33.199 --> 01:40:39.360
the term treated the notion of matter existing eternally independent for and IR IR irreconcilable with monotheism as

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:46.320
have most Christians since then then Scholars started arguing creation X nilo isn't in the Bible and things

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:51.400
changed what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was that you just dodged the whole question nobody gives a

01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:57.239
we're not talking about how to define monotheism we're not talking about what enlightenment Christians decided the

01:40:57.239 --> 01:41:04.480
monotheism was we're talking about Paul and what Paul believed in God does it require creation X hillo or no it

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:11.719
doesn't if you knew the sources this would be a done deal we're done but you're just completely dodged that

01:41:11.719 --> 01:41:17.280
question so and then he says so is it monotheism for Christians has always required creation next Neo look you

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:22.760
could tell he's confused what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or just since the enlightenment I'm a little confused here or is it just the

01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:29.040
term theism itself we're talking about no that's it Dan never responds to that

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:35.520
never he he he's done he just Taps out he just pretends it never happened he's gone you know how Dan responds to

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:40.760
everything on X or on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Tik Tok doesn't he can respond to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Almon

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:46.360
today why is he still hasn't responded to this so this is the last thing I said and I left it alone after this I said

01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:53.800
Dan are you all right should we get you some help talk about Gish Galloping holy moly you keep going off into areas that

01:41:53.800 --> 01:42:00.440
have nothing to do with anything that was said by the comment or my response to you none of this has anything to do

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:06.520
with Paul and First Century Middle platonism we can play a defined monotheism game all we want at these

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:13.560
stupid conferences that no one cares about I certainly don't care about them I don't care how you define monism I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all I care about is

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:18.599
what do Tech say we can play definition games all we want I don't care it's

01:42:18.599 --> 01:42:25.440
stupid that's why I think your uh dissertation was stupid about religion I I think it's dumb who cares none of that

01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:32.320
will change what happened in the past and rewrite what people believed so again for the fifth time based on what

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:38.639
every single person who studied 101 ancient philosophy and theology already knows why does the belief in a perfect

01:42:38.639 --> 01:42:43.719
Eternal one distinct from other Deon deities

01:42:43.719 --> 01:42:48.880
require ctio X niilo the answer is it doesn't and anyone who actually reads

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:54.400
the primary source about this period could tell you this Dan never replied

01:42:54.400 --> 01:43:01.360
Tapped Out done gave up because he knows he's done end of that's the end of that

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:09.639
story wow okay now for those of us who okay we got to call the match and

01:43:09.639 --> 01:43:14.960
what we see and we got to say it like it is here in the museum by the way 540

01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:21.440
people are watching this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right now yeah no thank you for the people who are coming new people to Lady Babylon um

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:27.400
yeah and by the way to the guy that we executed accidentally Chewy be better

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:33.639
with your blaster um what you've done is I really really

01:43:33.639 --> 01:43:40.280
like the fact that you're drawing it all back to those primaries and this is the

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:46.719
real problem when Dan wants to erect a boundary between Christians and

01:43:46.719 --> 01:43:52.280
non-christians living at the very same time or Jesus and those people around

01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:58.960
him um this is what the theology has given us it's t it's tamped

01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:07.080
down you know Julian do you think Julian was right after all that Neil and as a means of calm down um after the fight

01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:14.599
which by the way it was gruesome brah it was gruesome remind me to bring you along you can you can you know we can

01:44:14.599 --> 01:44:19.760
watch each other's back uh I appreciate that and you're flying with uh some

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:29.880
serious skill so um thank you for being a participant um but uh tell me this um

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:36.520
is there something in the theology degree is there something in the

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:41.599
religious history degree is there something in

01:44:41.599 --> 01:44:48.840
the in the fabric of the discipline that causes you to produce somebody who's

01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:54.119
going to make uh you know who's going to make big assertions without you know

01:44:54.119 --> 01:44:59.440
really looking at evidence um you're tell me this is what I'm asking this is

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:05.400
what I want your uh perspective on you're coming at these sources new in

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:10.960
the last couple of years right and you have managed to saturate I don't know

01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:16.480
how much time you sleep but you've managed to saturate yourself um when

01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:24.080
you're throwing things listen to your listen to you talking about Plato tonight that was fantastic timeus God

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:31.840
I'm like I wanted to find the exit like oh I hope he didn't call on me right you know what I mean so nice job nice job

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:37.639
gorgeous job and um kudos to you for that and that's all that matters at this

01:45:37.639 --> 01:45:47.360
lady Babylon Dojo that is all that matters that is executing the art and I

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:55.040
think that's what um really stings me about guys like Dan is that they um they

01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:00.719
bring a an element of deception uh to the

01:46:00.719 --> 01:46:05.800
science and that and I I think you're a great warrior for that uh for that

01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:11.560
reason uh so congratulations I I is there anything else you want to

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:18.560
throw in there after the you know you know it's not I think there's a there's there's what's evident in a lot of these

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:24.560
academic circles is there's certain it maybe not dogmas but like

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:29.599
there's certain atmospheres where certain things

01:46:29.599 --> 01:46:35.520
are there's ideas that are pushed easier than others if that Mak sense where it

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:41.280
there's a lot there's some group think going on it seems like and it seems like it seems like there's some political

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:46.320
layers there yeah and I'm not talking about one side being correct politically

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:53.119
or one side not being correct I don't care if I I might agree with his politics but that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] should not deter

01:46:53.119 --> 01:47:00.639
how I look at the ancient past yeah you shouldn't do that that's that's that's all that's all it's sloppy isn't it it's

01:47:00.639 --> 01:47:08.239
sloppy and you find that a lot unfortunately through seminaries you find kind of sloppy work like that um I

01:47:08.239 --> 01:47:14.080
would uh thank Dan for coming tonight I really appreciate the fact that he's

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:20.520
been a guest and this has been um Scrump I look forward to any responses we get I

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:29.239
I hope um for the for for the 586 people yeah um who have come I I

01:47:29.239 --> 01:47:34.440
feel the burden and the weight uh the responsibility of giving you um

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:40.080
something that's worth your time and I hope that tonight um you appreciate and

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:50.840
accept as a gift to you the vision of Jesus the Christ who is the drug using

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:57.639
um child prostituting a guy from a time when you couldn't

01:47:57.639 --> 01:48:04.920
always get away with that kind of thing you may get crucified for that kind of stuff um and the drugs thank you for

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:11.960
following the drugs through all this BR back the Dark Ages term oh yeah what what were you saying

01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:18.880
by the way about who figured so my my boy is petrarch he's one of the he's the one who coined the term in like the

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:24.840
1300s and then makavelli used it Brun broy used it Flavio used it it was big

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:30.599
in the Rena early Renaissance right around the time Constantinople fell people were like this is some dark [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

01:48:30.599 --> 01:48:36.119
going on in the last thousand in the last 800 something year whatever 500 years and they look you know what they

01:48:36.119 --> 01:48:42.480
were doing they were they were they were they were looking back at the classical Antiquities classical sources of

01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:48.800
antiquity they're looking back at Avid and Virgil and Homer and and and and

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:54.520
Aristotle and HIPAA who's the real martyr not the fake Martyrs that they've

01:48:54.520 --> 01:49:00.599
made fake legends about and and uh safo and all these amazing texts that we got

01:49:00.599 --> 01:49:06.840
yides all these amazing plays that we got all the mystery religions that people believed in that's what that's

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:13.960
that's what mavelli was saying he's saying everyone's atheist now this is before nii forget about nii makii was

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:19.199
saying the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nii was saying he was saying why is it everyone nobody even believes in this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anymore it's

01:49:19.199 --> 01:49:25.000
all just like fake people believe belied in religion back in the ancient Roman days

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:31.880
people look forward to the next Roman Festival of Magna mat people look forward to the games of Apollo people

01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:37.960
look forward to the dionan uh uh bakic revelries and the saturnalias every

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:44.520
month there was a new Festival to look forward to they're in now you got Easter and and Christmas yay no one gives a

01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:50.719
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and so they're they're called it the Dark Ages and I know um what's that

01:49:50.719 --> 01:49:56.239
scientist name oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] um he got in trouble he got in trouble for s for

01:49:56.239 --> 01:50:02.560
bringing that term up Dark Ages and all the all the academics were like bad bad

01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:10.760
that's a bad term you don't use that no you're not allowed to use dark ages anymore and uh you've been around

01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:18.719
academics now and you've been interacting with them by the way you also interacted with the great uh uh

01:50:18.719 --> 01:50:27.800
scholar who works uh in hia right and he worked with uh finklestein from Tel Aviv

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:35.719
and the dude who was on the megiddo Dig oh God God what gorgeousness and what

01:50:35.719 --> 01:50:42.280
was he can you just give the audience a punchline of that because you can't oh I

01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:48.159
got a clip actually okay oh you have a clip oh play it play it all right uh this is actually a good this will

01:50:48.159 --> 01:50:53.320
actually be a good uh this is this is all right I'm gonna stay tuned for my channel coming out out in the next day

01:50:53.320 --> 01:51:01.320
or two probably in the next two days something like that I have the full video of this

01:51:01.719 --> 01:51:08.599
clip um and you see it in the archaeological record so clearly there's nothing before and every and it starts

01:51:08.599 --> 01:51:14.840
after um that I think it's I mean it's really hard to yeah to argue with that

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:21.880
this is what I've been saying for as long as I started to discover some of this information um and then obviously

01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:27.199
we get the SE agent translation coming a little bit later but it doesn't seem

01:51:27.199 --> 01:51:32.280
like the construction or the creation of the Genesis for example let's just take

01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:39.920
Genesis by itself doesn't seem to be have been constructed that much earlier maybe less than a century before at some

01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:45.320
point decades yeah knowes do you hear what he said talked

01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:52.079
about Virgil do you hear what he said uh he said decades if not decades and by the

01:51:52.079 --> 01:51:58.000
way you know how I wasn't I wasn't setting him up I wasn't trying to put any words in his mouth I was so liberal

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.880
with how I handled that I'll go hey when do you think the trans I go when do you think the translation came about how

01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:10.119
Century at least he said maybe decades we're talking somewhere between

01:52:10.119 --> 01:52:17.560
300 and 270 is when we get the Torah according to a leading professor at hi

01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:22.679
University can I can I just say I told

01:52:22.679 --> 01:52:30.199
you so you've been saying it and yeah no he's he's right on it and um yeah good

01:52:30.199 --> 01:52:35.800
you know what it's nice that's so uh inspiring to see a scholar out there

01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:43.440
who's willing to say exactly how it is even though hey you know what that means right I mean that's Neil that's uh

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:49.599
that's an atomic bomb if he's got a book that guy so stay tuned for my podcast

01:52:49.599 --> 01:52:54.800
with him two and a half hours long all we're talking about is dating he calls

01:52:54.800 --> 01:53:00.800
it yahwism yahoo from the elephantine we talk about elephantine yahwism how

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:06.320
they're all polytheistic there's no Moses there's no Abraham there's no Noah there's no Jacob there's no David

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:12.199
anywhere for a thousand years before 300 BC and then then he says heck there is

01:53:12.199 --> 01:53:17.320
the first person to ever mentioned Moses everything we both been saying for on this on your channel on my channel for

01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:24.440
the last year and two years he says it right here he his own we his his his word is so is separate than us how is it

01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:30.760
that he's coming to the exact same conclusions as you and me because we're reading the sources you the science only

01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:36.440
works one way you don't come to two different conclusions when you have when you run the certain tests and with the

01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:43.040
same evidence it's amazing that um people didn't you know don't realize that

01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:48.520
classical philology study of uh ancient Greek and lot that's a very scientific

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:57.719
discipline you know you know he said it's so first thing he says in that clip it is so clear there's nothing before he

01:53:57.719 --> 01:54:03.040
meant he's talking about 300 BC he's talking about the year when he said before he meant the Library of

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:09.920
Alexandria because we were just talking about that right before that clip he goes it's so clear there's nothing

01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:15.239
before the Library of Alexandria and then all of a sudden after the Library of Alexandria you get all these Bible

01:54:15.239 --> 01:54:20.360
texts everywhere and all of a sudden synagogue start by the way the oldest synagogue in the archaeological record

01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:29.199
is like 175 BC open it I was there the oldest one yeah second second century um

01:54:29.199 --> 01:54:36.400
uh Greek It's All Greek that's there that's all they've got left is the Greek because they didn't have any Hebrew

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:44.000
right and people are always shocked they're like yeah by the way speaking about Dan he's he tells people that the

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:50.480
biblical story becomes historical during and but at the time of

01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:57.159
David which means king who had all these wives and concubines the richest man in the world who had all these lands and

01:54:57.159 --> 01:55:03.360
territories we where's the evidence of that why do you mean historical what the

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:09.079
what that um I ran up his only book that he has out his only piew book uh

01:55:09.079 --> 01:55:16.000
yahweh's Divine Images and one of I read it one of it's like right in the first chapter he's dating the biblical he's

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.159
dating the Bible to like 700 BC he is in that book yeah that's guess

01:55:22.159 --> 01:55:28.880
guess who published that bookl okay got it okay now I understand

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:38.119
yeah I hope they made some cash on their on their deception um yeah um yeah okay I was

01:55:38.119 --> 01:55:43.880
gonna say something it just kind of fled my mind um it I'm kind of overwhelmed

01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:51.520
because uh it's you know with the megido Dig um and uh your professor from hia he

01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.920
knows uh um he knows finklestein right yeah um

01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:02.880
um yeah anyway with that dig they were saying it Mido weren't you on that dig

01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:08.920
yeah I was and what they were saying from uh the season that I was there at

01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:14.840
least um what they were saying is that one of the layers was Solomon's right

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:24.360
this is Solomon's Way Station and this is where they take tolls and there's no right that stuff's all made made up it's

01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:30.000
all made up right that's why when they dug down to the Canaanite floor I was like yep that's part of our video we

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:36.119
talk we said that's another thing Gad was saying he goes we use the terms second and first temple period what does

01:56:36.119 --> 01:56:42.280
that even mean it's all based on the Bible none there is no first and second temple period by the way Herod what was

01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:48.119
that the Third Temple then why don't we call it the temple that fell in 70 that's the Third Temple and it's not

01:56:48.119 --> 01:56:54.440
even like poy the Great saxs temple in 63 BCE they Temple gone after that they have to rebuild it after that there's

01:56:54.440 --> 01:57:00.000
like there's a whole bunch of Temple periods but we don't but but we only say first and second why because that's what

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:06.199
the Bible says yeah it's like an infiltration because when you say this is us and we

01:57:06.199 --> 01:57:13.440
are different just like Dan was doing tonight This Is Us Christianity um and we are different

01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:21.079
from everybody else around us um then you can treat your scholarship that way and your history can come out completely

01:57:21.079 --> 01:57:27.079
just a bastard IED form of reality and it's been in those periods when people

01:57:27.079 --> 01:57:32.280
discover the source right when you go back to the source and you know what I'm

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:39.760
talking about now you've been there right you worship The Muse baby it's those sources that are everything the

01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:47.800
sources are everything so yeah I'm gonna throw it I'm gonna throw it to you then and I'm gonna say hey um give me your

01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:55.639
last thoughts on the evening um it's been an interesting week we've had a lot of things going on um give me your last

01:57:55.639 --> 01:58:00.920
thoughts and we'll throw it to the uh chewy if you can get any questions that

01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:06.679
you want to bring up bring them up but go ahead a man I think we need to uh

01:58:06.679 --> 01:58:13.719
there's one thing I do agree with Dan on is the uh the notion of serving relig

01:58:13.719 --> 01:58:20.639
religion serving this class of Protestants and Catholics and Orthodox

01:58:20.639 --> 01:58:26.920
Christians needs the go as if we're still in the Dark Ages I'll just say it like that

01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:33.320
because once we can bring back the idea that religion is has to do with the uh

01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:38.719
the reflection of the self the the the inspiration of what we

01:58:38.719 --> 01:58:45.440
call the Muse that dionan Spirit the frenzy the inspiration the bakic Mania

01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:51.400
baby give people fired up about something artistic expression as in the

01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:57.920
ancient Greek and the ancient Romans and the even the ancient Indians and and all the and the Hindus and there's a lot of

01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:04.280
ancient Africans as well bring back the ancient expression of the self as

01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:10.360
religion bring back the images again idolatry is not evil the image bring an

01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:17.840
image of every single type of person that exists hermafroditas everything needs to be on

01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:24.480
a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] as an altar to be worshiped an image that represents the self not just

01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:31.480
one face of a bearded guy on a cross no we need to kill that that's

01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:35.880
what religion needs to be that's what I'll

01:59:36.599 --> 01:59:42.480
say about are you talking about cult or you what are you talking about yeah

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:48.119
bring back local Cults again mystery religions do it yeah people will actually have something to believe in

01:59:48.119 --> 01:59:55.199
again instead of a Dogma instead of Dogma right remember remember that term that they had at the or Oracle of dely

01:59:55.199 --> 02:00:01.880
what was that what was that phrase that was on the wall at the Oracle of Deli n South Town right or was that yeah no

02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:09.560
that was on the apulo the temple Apollo yeah the Oracle right yeah love

02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:14.840
it oh God BR back image bring back the image of the the Virgin Warrior

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:24.360
manur yeah those are the things that made people want to live yeah right the yeah the reality the

02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:29.800
reality there's a Zeal now what do you say though what do you say though Neil hang on what do you say cuz people are

02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:36.440
saying in the comments and stuff and I hope people in the chat we can talk about this too um but people are saying

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:41.920
talked for three and a half hours the first whole hour was just about what you said it was me responding

02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:47.920
to to your interview without even seeing it just kind of feeling out what Danny was telling me that you were talking

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:53.159
about so it is kind of a part two in a way it is kind of a part two to yours

02:01:53.159 --> 02:01:59.000
good good good I mean it sounds like it'll be a nice Bridge um uh that's

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:08.119
that's gorgeous and I'm you know what that is look what's going on man that's collegial uh advancement in science baby

02:02:08.119 --> 02:02:14.520
that's what you're doing you're talking about text you're talking about looking at text and how to translate oh speak speaking of text one more text before we

02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:22.960
go one more text before we go I got on the bottom remember remember we were talking about the idea of the the whole

02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:29.599
the mark 14 theory that you that or the mark 14 reading as you would call it

02:02:29.599 --> 02:02:38.440
actually has some evidence behind it the PGM is a contemporary text with the gospels and it tells you to not to to to

02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:43.520
Helios wrap a naked in linen a seone

02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:49.320
right from head to toe clap your hands ringing your noise and it says says

02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:57.760
Adonai El yah Bo what is the words that Jesus says on the cross elah

02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:04.199
elaton so there is an argument there's a solid slam good argument I think to be

02:03:04.199 --> 02:03:10.280
made that this could be some sort of this could be some sort of magical text going on I'm just

02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:15.400
saying I just open up a whole new Canon War right there no no you know Neil I've

02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:21.000
got a whole book of Christian early Christian magic somewhere and um those

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:27.639
texts I think lot of them are Coptic um but yeah no seeing the use of the magic there are a lot of naked boys that

02:03:27.639 --> 02:03:34.360
you're going to find running around in um a lot of weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that in the PG magical text I found 20 like that

02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:40.199
there's like 20 of them like that I'm so glad that you brought me

02:03:40.199 --> 02:03:47.280
those naked boys tonight I appreciate it anyone anyone know where I can see a copy of the performance of media they

02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:53.520
got him excommunicated now technically who is that Milo um Milo uh let me tell

02:03:53.520 --> 02:04:00.000
you this um I wasn't excommunicated because in order to be excommunicated

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.679
you got to be communicated and I was not communicated

02:04:05.679 --> 02:04:11.079
so they couldn't excommunicate me um they could just fire me and um that's

02:04:11.079 --> 02:04:16.800
what happened um by the way that performance of media oh is absolutely

02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:22.559
delicious to have a I I just want I'm glad you brought it up because I just want to say this imagine just imagine

02:04:22.559 --> 02:04:27.760

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:40.480
dildos pointed at priests who had been accused of being

02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:48.199
pedophiles oh my God that was the sexiest um deont told me no no I want to

02:04:48.199 --> 02:04:56.239
tell people what the effect of that was historically I want this down somebody write this down um the effect of those

02:04:56.239 --> 02:05:01.840

of this in the midst of all of this there's a there's a chemistry that's

02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:30.880
going on between the stage and and the audience that's perceiving the play and

02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:36.679
that chemistry could be felt in the Seminary the Seminary

02:05:36.679 --> 02:05:42.920

death um great guy and you know what he would have um he would have been if he

02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:49.440
didn't become a vicer general he would have ultimately um in another life he

02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:54.520

02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:59.960
the poets Neil you know what I mean um so any who um that was totally unrelated

02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:06.920

02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:19.280
the Iowa Scaro who wrote like this guy is totally possessed

02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:24.599
right so um yeah uh we're gonna we're gonna get the

02:07:24.599 --> 02:07:30.400
Greek Plato said being possessed is the highest form of of a state you can be in

02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:35.920
that bakic Mania baby yeah exactly exactly it's gonna be it you know the

02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:41.199
other day um NE Holy Spirit when when you see by the way this just blows my

02:07:41.199 --> 02:07:49.400
mind when and and you know who wrote a lot about this was KL keni uh an early religion scholar of the from the 1900s

02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:55.559
to 1940s I think somewhere in between there early early to Middle first half of the 20th century let's just say that

02:07:55.559 --> 02:08:01.639
and he he was friends with kyl young they they co-wrote books together actually I have it right here this guy this book right here is co-written by

02:08:01.639 --> 02:08:07.280
Carl Young and KL Ken essays on a science of Mythology and they talk about

02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:14.760
look when you when you see these snake handling Christians speaking in tongues and going shaken because they have the

02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:21.480
Holy Spirit that's bakic Mania they're adopting that from the Greeks this is an Ancient Ancient idea from the mystery

02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:28.559
religions that's being passed down all the way until today totally totally totally and you know the PE um the

02:08:28.559 --> 02:08:33.639
Christian Community is going to have to face this more and more as the knowledge

02:08:33.639 --> 02:08:40.199
spreads they're going to see their own Origins and they're not going to like what they see and the naked boy the

02:08:40.199 --> 02:08:47.599

02:10:09.599 --> 02:10:15.159
the one who stuck his neck out great scientists of our time he stuck his neck

02:10:15.159 --> 02:10:20.639
out and said the Dark Ages was a real legitimate term and I'm standing by it

02:10:20.639 --> 02:10:27.000
and he got in trouble for that I even heard a scholar say he did damage for saying that on his show on his show look

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:34.800
it up it's on YouTube the episode one of Cosmos from a show from the 1990s or 1980s or something old show it's called

02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:40.440

and Plato and Aristotle and and Archimedes and uh uh all these amazing

02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:53.119
writers from these from these time from mathematicians and scientists figuring out the movements of the stars and all

02:10:53.119 --> 02:10:59.880
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and the death of hpaa and the alexandrian library and then he uses the term dark ases that follows it and they

02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:05.400
were like he did damage for saying that that was mean you shouldn't have said

02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:11.840
that that's not that's not a legitimate term to use anymore nope I agree with Carl

02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:18.559
