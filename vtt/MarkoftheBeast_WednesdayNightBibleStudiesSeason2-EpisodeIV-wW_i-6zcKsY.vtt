tonight right to the beginning of the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.680
Apocalypse

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.000
and we're going to look at a little bit

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.680
of Greek we're going to translate a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.360
little bit just run along fluidly

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.180
because I need to run you too

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.140
the image here we are being faithful to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.820
the image

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.220
of the son of man

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.280
we must maintain the Integrity of that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.079
image let me show you that image

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.259
foreign

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.860
in the middle

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460
of these lamp stands

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.220
is the image of someone like the son of

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.460
man

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.540
dressed all the way to his feet

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.039
and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.280
and zoned on up

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.760
king shirt on up joined on up

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.020
on his master on his breath

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.239
around his breasts

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.720
he is girding the King James will

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.300
translate GERD

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.459
yeah gird up your breasts ladies

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.459
um we're using support material

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.040
remember I'm transporting you to a place

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.160
where the goddess

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.019
is is the model is the original

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.660
so don't let it surprise you that Jesus

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.360
is cross-dressing

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.540
In this passage he's wearing a bra

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.060
and it says it's twice my stories we

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.400
talked about that previously so I won't

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.879
be to beat the point into the ground but

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.300
when you check the victorians you get in

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.860
your ship and you fly back to the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.360
victorians at Oxford and you say hey

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.800
um gentlemen

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.959
right what are these mastoise here well

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.480
the grammarians from Antiquities say the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.700
victorians they tell us that these are

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.060
feminine breasts

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.519
that this will have to be mods

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.700
have to have the data in there in order

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.440
for it to be men

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.019
now are there examples where that flip

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.819
back and forth sure

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.920
and here's the problem this is the big

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.620
one that they hold up because the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.400
victorians could not imagine a world

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.760
where Jesus would be walking around

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.860
with feminine breasts

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.140
yes they couldn't imagine the world

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.480
where Jesus had breasts

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.799
does not say a lot

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.480
why can none of us imagine a world where

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.060
Jesus has breasts

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.659
and is wearing a very nice

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.000
a very nice bra

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.519
that the text is very specific is

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.380
holding up is

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.660
it's it's Perry

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.699
it's around them it's structure it's

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.639
support it's underwire

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.720
from antiquity

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.720
um

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.660
and it's a golden bra it's a golden bra

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.580
that's important

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.919
fashion is a big thing

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.780
right and we know that there are

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.340
different colors and materials

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.280
associated with these priesthoods

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.340
that are involved in the Mysteries

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.740
right sometimes they're labeled by their

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.180
colors

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.419
yeah so they use the gold here is

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.759
quite quite important and not only that

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.979
it says you know perhaps he's got good

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.460
taste

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.600
I'll do

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.580
his head his hair is three case

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.120
they're white they're not blonde

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.120
they're white his lady hair is white

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.919
do you get the feeling

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.560
I know I rocketed us into that text

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.960
tonight but do you get the feeling that

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.060
something's wrong do you get a little

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.380
nausea

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.600
a little bit sensation wait a minute

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.759
that nausea you're feeling is because

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.220
this work is written

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.919
by a civil

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.440
and restructured

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.440
with very obvious little oh and that

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.360
person that that was talking about is

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.860
Jesus

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.440
little inserts

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.180
you know they call the early Christian

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.940
sybilis for a reason right

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.539
sybilis who is the daughter

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.600
who is the daughter it's heropoly

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.400
that Sybil

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.699
who is the daughter of the lamia

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.840
the lamia Hang on we're almost there to

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.340
her I'm showing you vampire Jesus

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.639
who sucks the blood of little boys

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.160
vampire Jesus who sucks the blood of

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.199
little boys there we go

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.539
what's after his white wig

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.520
verse 15.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.418
his feet

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.960
looks like

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.919
halcolibanos is or Lebanon is a is a

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:48.660
word that's just two words slammed

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.000
together one of them's bronze

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.819
that's where we get the calc root and

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.259
the other word is is used for incense

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:00.419
you know the pro the problem is we don't

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.819
have a lot of references to these two

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.699
words being smashed together

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.680
so it really should mean literally

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.460
bronze

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.460
incense

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.120
you mean is his feet his bottom of his

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.080
legs are like bronze incense

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.319
wow that's kind of strange so

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.020
um we've translated this not we but you

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.699
know the king

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.479
and his men have translated this as

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:34.680
um

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.960
bronze

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.740
in reflection or bronze in color

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.740
right brazen

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.979
his bronzed feet

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:51.599
why does Jesus have bronze feet white

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:55.919
wig and lingerie

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:57.599
what happened

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:01.340

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.919
phonet that voice

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:08.720
which is the Voice who docked on polon

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.900

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.560
the voice of many Waters what better

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.960
Sybil

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.160
as then she Who is the granddaughter of

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.460
ocean

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.720
the great daughter

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.520
of lamia

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.860
why would you bring up Lamy here who's

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.820
lamia labia is a Libyan Queen

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.300
is a Libyan Queen

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.919
and lamia

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.519
in her

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:53.360
intercourse with Zeus

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.519
sacrifices her children

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.540
yeah

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.880
yeah she has to

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.980
to the jealousy

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.680
to the jealousy of Hera

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:12.959
you know those children are lost taken

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:14.459
away from her

00:09:14.459 --> 00:09:17.100
so imagine lamia

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.800
who is the mother

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.339
who pulls out her own eyes

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:27.000
yeah and what does she do after that

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.860
she prowls the world

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.860
looking for young boys

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.500
yeah looking for young boys you know me

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.519
Cersei you know I showed you

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:42.120
Cersei I showed you and you showed

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.760
yourself you revealed yourself

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.720
yes

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.120
Cersei

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.380
drinks the blood

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.220
oh

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:56.839
yeah

00:09:56.839 --> 00:09:59.640
let's take a look at lamia

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.160
shall we let's go to Libya let's get in

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.720
our ship and go to Libya and really what

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.160
we're doing

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.899
for those of you who are asking why are

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:09.899
we on this field trip because here we're

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:12.300
going to take a look away from the

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.279
garden where Jesus is arrested with that

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:15.480
naked boy

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.080
and we're going to look at the cross

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.080
and we're going to say okay this is the

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.260
all part of the same crime scene right

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.680
so what is he doing there what is he

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.800
saying we can get his blood we can get

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.560
us you know do all sorts of things but

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.779
what do we have record-wise we've got

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:40.080
records of his speech

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.920
so what is he saying before he's dying

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.100
and maybe we can solve the idea of why

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.019
does he die prematurely right people

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:51.660
don't realize everybody in the world

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.600
will tell you Jesus Christ was crucified

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.940
he died by crucifixion he didn't die by

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.800
crucifixion

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.000
that's what the Roman guards noticed

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.440
Centurion

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.079
that dudes already dead he's not

00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:09.420

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.560
because this dude's in deep

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.019

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:52.019
we have tonight this is from Dayo

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:54.000

golden mouth this is late first early

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.839
second in that range that's when he's

00:12:00.839 --> 00:12:02.760
writing doing his thing

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.279
yeah and he tells us about Libya

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.380
the general character and appearance

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.660
of their body

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.600
we're as follows the face was that of a

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.600
woman

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.480
now he says a brief woman right and that

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.940
translation is not is

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.820
is no good because this is a woman in

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.500
her prime

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.019
this is herpes she who's at her Acme

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.760

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.079
appearance is

00:12:37.079 --> 00:12:39.660
this is a group of people

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.820
in Libya

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.920
yeah

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.899
the breast

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:49.260
and bosom and the neck too

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.720
were extremely beautiful

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.600
the life of which no mortal maid or

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.880
bride in the bloom of Youth

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.680
could claim

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.440
isn't that nice nobody can claim this

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.620
these people were gorgeous

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.899
okay

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:09.839
Norse sculptor nor painter will ever be

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:12.120
able to reproduce

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.639
yeah let those of you who have ears to

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:15.839
hear hear

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:20.220
yeah the complexion was of dazzling

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.440
brightness now this one this one also

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.920
falls a little short I I did the grit to

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.540
make sure and um it's a re it's it's a

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.820
light emanating from

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.100
her skin

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.620
the the face as she looks at you

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.820
emanates light we've only seen this

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.339
um in one other group and that is the

00:13:44.339 --> 00:13:46.019
group from Georgia

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:48.720
it turns out that's how you know

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:54.360
a daughter of ETS is that her skin glows

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.860
that's why we call her one of the

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.540
reasons we call her the granddaughter of

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.440
the Sun

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.240
She Glows

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.519
interesting libyans

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:04.079
beautiful

00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:05.339
laughs

00:14:05.339 --> 00:14:10.079
the glance of the eyes aroused affection

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:13.260
a yearning in The Souls of all that

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.639
beheld

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:17.579
that's interesting

00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:20.579
um sort of she's got a Henry Cavill

00:14:20.579 --> 00:14:21.839
thing going

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:25.500
yes Chewie don't look like that you know

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.360
what I'm talking about the rest of the

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.579
body was hard

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:33.000
and protected by scales and all the

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.459
lower part was snake

00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:39.180
ending in the snake's baleful head

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.300
now the story does not say that these

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.540
animals were winged like the sphinxes

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.720
nor that they liked them spoke or made

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.959
any sound whatever except a hissing

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:54.060
noise

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.760
that's the hissing of the pipe

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.880
it's the same word to express it

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.279
right when you're talking to Angels you

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:04.620
don't hear

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.199
you don't hear what you think what has

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:09.779
been portrayed to you in the fairy tale

00:15:09.779 --> 00:15:13.139
yeah it says in the text that you hear

00:15:13.139 --> 00:15:14.880
the sound of an instrument everybody's

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.639
like what up

00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:20.040
his voice is like a trumpet what help

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.600
and they don't understand it because

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.800
we've lost the context

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.579
scales

00:15:26.579 --> 00:15:29.040
and what do they do

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.800
what do these lamiah do these lay me

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.240
eyes go out

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.519
and they hunt

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:38.339
they hunt after young boys

00:15:38.339 --> 00:15:41.940
whose blood they suck

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.220
whose blood they suck

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.760
and whose flesh they eat

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.180
it is all in the blood

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.199
and in the body

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.160
what do these lay me I look like

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.079
what do they look like please

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.260
let's go to set our time ship for

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.899
Aristophanes Athenian comedian

00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:15.660
young guy well you know he's he's

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.180
writing he's pretty young when he's when

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.940
he's successful highly successful right

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.920
and here he is what is he writing he's

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.560
he's identifying this is from the frogs

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.260
aristophony's play where Dionysus get

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.120
that off of there for a minute let me

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.880
explain context I'm terribly

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.740
they shouldn't have done that

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.440
it's the frogs and he's explaining it um

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.740
Dionysus and xanthius are going to the

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.699
underworld they're making their trip

00:16:47.699 --> 00:16:52.019
their catalysis if you if you want to

00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:53.399
ah

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:55.440
but they're making their trips the

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.000
underworld and then coming back and

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.500
they're going to bring back with them

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.320
euripides isn't that funny they're going

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.940
to bring back within euripides but they

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.178
run into on the way

00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:10.140
um chorus of initiates

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.620
they look for Heracles

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.418
Heracles

00:17:15.419 --> 00:17:19.500
yes and remember this is the same stage

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.839
where we took in Greece where we took

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:25.980
that bakic religious procession and

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.580
funneled it into the stage right there

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.500
in the stage so that thing could be

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.260
performed in front of you

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.900
so when aristophany steps up there he's

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.000
not stepping up there as a war of

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.440
Brothers guy

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.860
right he's not working for Disney

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.260
he's working for the Muse this is a

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.760
sacred Act

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.100
this is a sacred act so everything must

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.360
be

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.960
shot on if we're going to bring back

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.320
lamia so that Jesus can sit on the cross

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.179
and scream

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:04.200
lay me a sabak's son

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.360
the one from

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.380
the one from the Sun

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.380
from the liminal Earth

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.960
the one to bring back from the dead the

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.580
great Queen

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.400
yeah if we're going to invoke her like

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.260
Jesus did on a cross

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.340
then we're going to have to understand

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.220
who she is we have a very beautiful just

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.200

women who were experimenting with

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.780
Pharmaceuticals

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.000
women who were delivering babies

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.980
right women who were stopping other

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.440
women from bleeding to death

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.539
this is that type of woman

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.539
so

00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:27.139
when Jesus finds himself on the cross

00:21:27.539 --> 00:21:30.960
you and I follow the fairy tale and we

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.440
say this is this is a translation of

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.679
some Hebrew no it's not

00:21:36.679 --> 00:21:40.679
there isn't the Hebrew going around in

00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:43.080
the first century

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.080
yeah this is a Cristos

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.580
that

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.059
is a Greek concept

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:56.760
I was telling my class last Saturday of

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.340
the superiority

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.700
of ancient Greek and why it is that we

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.799
have the expression is what's Greek To

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:05.580
Me

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.380
right and not why don't we say it about

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.000
every other language and why did the

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.880
Romans say that about Greek

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.039
there's a reason for that there's a

00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:16.740
scientific reason for that and it's my

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.400
job to push those students into the

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.520
place that they can absorb that they can

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.860
see the superior functioning of the

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.559
language and they can benefit from it

00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:30.720
they can how do they do that by the

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.299
translation

00:22:32.299 --> 00:22:35.640
so when we have a text like the

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.140
apocalypse

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.539
and John is writing about a very

00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:43.620
specific woman called The Morning Star

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.640
yeah when he's writing about her

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.240
and has to insert Jesus

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.860
he just really does so

00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:00.539
does it bother him that she is wearing

00:23:00.539 --> 00:23:02.039
feminine

00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:03.900
garb

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.340
now John writes it right he leaves it in

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.140
because she's the morning star and we

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.200
all know what the Morning Star does we

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.480
all know her

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.419
yeah we all know her we know she drinks

00:23:18.419 --> 00:23:21.360
the blood of young boys

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.520
we know that she does

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.400
is Jesus in invoking lamia from the

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.020
cross

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:35.480
screaming about how thirsty he is

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.200
if he invokes the goddess herself of

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.659
this history

00:23:42.659 --> 00:23:44.220
past

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.440
that comes through Libya

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.059
and Georgia

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:51.419
which are somehow connected thanks to

00:23:51.419 --> 00:23:53.220
the syrians

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.500
right love it

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.620
right here she is if he is invoking this

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.600
right

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.760
it would give him a reason to be

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.860
arrested in a public park

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.740
at 4am with a naked boy

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:11.520
what was that bandage doing

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.960
yeah

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.380
what was that bandage doing

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.179
um

00:24:18.179 --> 00:24:20.340
by the way for those of you who want to

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.860
make Jesus's bandages underwear because

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.280
there's a tendency for translators to do

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.900
that

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.320
um yeah you know that you're wrong and

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.440
you know there's no word there for what

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.539
soldiers and Hunters anybody else who's

00:24:36.539 --> 00:24:39.720
girding up their loins puts on

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.600
kid doesn't have it he's gumnos but he

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.400
does have a bandage with him we know

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.200
these bandages are impregnated with

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.419
drugs and

00:24:48.419 --> 00:24:50.700
does he have a bandage because he's

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.480
lamely invoking boy blood sucking

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.900
vampire God

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.280
is with him in the garden

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.419
yeah

00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:07.020
yeah I think we're getting closer

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.240
I think we're getting closer to seeing

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.940
in order to see Jesus you have to see

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.080
lamia

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.419
you have to see lamia there's a reason

00:25:15.419 --> 00:25:17.460
that they're described the way the way

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.520
they are the language is a is a

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.220
fingerprint it preserves the crime scene

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.340
preserves the evidence that we need it's

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.260
like the amber that preserves that

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.020
mosquito

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.539
so we have the old DNA

00:25:33.539 --> 00:25:36.179
from 40 million years ago

00:25:36.179 --> 00:25:36.600
yeah

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.980

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.419
that you are seeing that point in

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:56.820
history for what it is we should be able

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.700
to see that now in the present should be

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.159
able to bring that past and then that

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:03.840
future together

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.900
the daughter of lamia is the Civil

that's what everything is about that's

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:14.820
why we early Christians call ourselves

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.860
sybilis

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.140
