and I'm gonna immediately Buckle in because we're immediately gonna have our orientation

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.900
flipped many of you are sitting there

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.860
thinking that the apostles were old men

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.280
no no it turns out

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.240
they were all teenagers yeah the apostles

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.120
were teenagers I'm gonna reach in and pull this right out of an organization

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.759
that is Gateway Crossroads or something of Israel promoting the

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:23.580
um Evangelical agendas and we're going to hear it from their mouths tell us tell us about the age of

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.620
Jesus's followers sure you personally want to look like Jesus a good place to

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.800
start is to have a bunch of 13 to 18 year olds around you following you and asking you questions all the time the

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.440
disciples were not 30 year old bearded men they were 12 to 19 years old when

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.900
Jesus wanted to change the world he chose teenagers to do it okay I want to

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:53.699
play that again because I want you to hear it right out of their own lips I want you to hear it the apostles are

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:03.960
teenagers roughly from 10 to 12 ish up to 19 ish yeah so when we talk about the

but put them into a malleable state where they were aroused and psychotic

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.920
then he would be doing this he wasn't he would right he wasn't just knocking

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:49.740

um let's go to the third one the next one up okay so here we get

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.700
um look at the field Tron I want you to notice from the bottom line we have the same word here and I'll just translate

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:11.040

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:19.320

apostles his followers yes

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:46.140
let's go back to that text what does it say p when he when Jesus is giving Peter

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:53.459
a hard time this is what does g what does Peter say to him he says you know my friend us you know

00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:48.959
it's we got a ship full of kids in the Bible with Jesus in a form that can only be described as

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:56.100

00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:32.880

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:40.980

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:19.759
morning Peter wakes up on the boat naked

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:27.179
Peter you drugged out Sex Fiend I feel sorry

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:31.520
for you that he did what he did to you Peter

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:37.919
we got to get Peter to flip and give a confession that's all there is to it

00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:43.559
he's got a lot of people know exactly where Jesus touched him

00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:49.740
yeah exactly what he did to him did he do what he did to that boy in the

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:55.080
garden yeah did he did he do that and wrap that

00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:01.620

funny about your body huh interesting

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:14.039
Peter you got to tell us take us back to the sources let it let's hit people with a few more sources Ryan you got no

00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:26.400
stuff um the very next one yeah and so oh here it is people here's the lawyer's point

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.440
right all you lawyers out there this is the one it's admissible and

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.780
trans-dimensional court and this is the one that has it are you ready what's he

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:43.320
gonna do Jesus got some some goodies for him right and he's there on the beach

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:49.799
and they're waking up in the morning one of them goes oh my God it's Christ

00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:56.580
and they jump out and Peter puts his pants on right right and there they are

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:03.179
and Jesus says I get new you guys don't have any fish sauce it's the colloquial way of saying fish

00:24:03.179 --> 00:24:08.280
just a fish meal you guys don't you you're out there as fishermen and you

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:15.539
didn't catch any fish you didn't catch any fish okay look he's got everything ready to cook up a nice meal he's got

00:24:15.539 --> 00:24:22.559
everything this is gonna be a beach morning beach party but what does he say in that text that is so disturbing that

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:28.039
we're gonna get him on look at that third line pie days

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:45.240
first he says oh my kitties what does he call them it's gross too

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.820
right it gets gross because he uses the diminutive with Peter's like I mean you

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:56.059
love me so much feed my sheepies

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:04.140
what that's what he called his little boys he called him his sheepies it's not even

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:10.100
sheep and Greek it's a diminutive a little sheep

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:17.039
my little sheep okay are you one of Jesus's little sheep

00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:23.280
is that what you are you want to know what those real sheep were in the beginning

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:33.179
they were victims of abuse and rape Jesus was a child rapist

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:41.820
let's see see he said now let's let's translate that one line one line what is it whoo

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:50.419
there it is Titus he calls them children my little children what kind of children

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.700
wait a minute that's like what that's like a professional term what with

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:03.440
something of the sea some kind of here Alice see if you can tell us Alice what that is look at what is it

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.520
a laborer working person working woman

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:16.200
but if you funnel it through it's the Runaway

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:22.980
the one attached to the late Stace the lace days do you see the word lace

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:30.620
days all of you all of you evangelicals right now who were sitting there

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:38.179
I was banking for you this is a spanking for you

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:45.059
look it's right there lay stays all of you evangelicals are saying it's a word

00:26:45.059 --> 00:26:53.899
for thief and that naked boy wasn't naked he was dead and he was 30.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:02.059
okay you know what gives me the ability to do that

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.039
classical philology

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:16.380
the language the boys

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:24.179
are co-workers they have a shared monetary interest

00:27:24.179 --> 00:27:32.159
they are gaming from their association with Jesus

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:39.140
and you wonder why when he's arrested with a naked kid again

00:27:39.179 --> 00:27:45.539
why it is that everybody's saying what Jesus what you're not a Who

00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:52.380
you're not a lace this okay okay and then a mob forms

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:58.580
right angry mob angry mob and Jesus's worst nightmare

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:04.860
comes true his cover is blown Jesus

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:10.440

you live by silence there are those of you who have ears to

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:30.720
hear because Jesus has groomed you and has initiated you

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:37.740

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:45.900

you read books that are written by morons who praise this guy

00:30:25.919 --> 00:30:33.840
yeah you study science that these morons contradict then you still give them room

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:40.320
you still give them room while they destroy your civilization do you wonder why the Watchers think we're a bunch of

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.179
morons do you wonder

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:51.720
those are the Lost Boys your reality now is that the apostles were a bunch of

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:58.679
abused children in your world is made up of people who

00:30:58.679 --> 00:31:05.720

supporting an organization that was started by a child trafficker

the guy that you snuggle with he was snuggling children

00:31:45.299 --> 00:31:52.500
yeah isn't that ironic what a Twist what a Twist an Evangelical world what a

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:58.200
twist your God is the one who is the rapist of children the thing that you

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:04.020
run around saying yeah we're gonna save the children we're

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:11.240
gonna rip down this society and save the children just like we did in the first century

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:18.840
and we just watch it happen right it's all they're supposed to do is

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:25.980
the Watchers anyway I want to read to you a little bit of Celsius just just for the sake of the Celsius please I

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:32.940
just won't quote Sal says can you come here and some people call them calluses that's fine I've heard medieval people

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:39.240
who do medieval Latin um I've heard them say calluses but you know Celsius there was a physician named

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:44.778
Celsius too good Roman physician wrote a lot about drugs

00:32:45.419 --> 00:32:54.720
let's see what Celsius says the honor the Christians pay to Jesus is

00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:02.159
no different from the sort paid to Hadrian's favorite boy and 10 of us

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:08.460
the honor they paid Jesus is the same as the cult

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:15.299
of antinos do you know who antennas was he was Hadrian's naked boy

00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:20.580
Hadrian wasn't arrested in a public park at 4 am like Jesus was

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:27.840
but he had his boys like Jesus did and you know he had one that he had a

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:33.539
certain special affinity for and you know um

00:33:33.539 --> 00:33:39.179
this is the way it was the way it was yeah yeah

00:33:39.179 --> 00:33:47.460
um this is how the Christians worship says Celsius they're worshiping in the same rights as the boy loving rights of

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:53.840
antinous didn't she like your wife Adrian shut up

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.100

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:56.579
early in the morning I just wanted you to see early in the morning this is in the boat Ryan Jesus standing there on

00:39:56.579 --> 00:40:02.820
the shoreline right and so are these little students right these little students they don't recognize them

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:10.320
because they're on the boat they don't recognize me stand on the shore give me the next one Chewie yep and what happens

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:15.660
Jesus says them hey kiddos by the uh ride you got nothing to eat right and

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:22.079
they answer them no we're hungry why and here he comes what's gonna happen then

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:27.300
um well look at this Simon on this second line Simon Peter therefore when

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:34.640
he heard that he was Jesus he wrapped himself in some clothing um because he was naked

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.900
right on a boat offshore

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:47.280
with a bunch of boys okay and now I want you to see how

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:52.440
historically difficult this has been to translate because people don't want to

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.660
talk about what he's doing with naked boys right or what he's doing naked with

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:04.920
the boys so when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he put his outer garment on parentheses

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:10.619
the parentheses do not exist in that text for he was stripped for work oh I

00:41:10.619 --> 00:41:16.980
see uh yeah I get naked when I fish too right I and when I fall asleep after

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:22.619
I've been fishing and haven't caught anything I naturally just fall asleep naked because that's what I've been

00:41:22.619 --> 00:41:28.099
doing all night naked fishing I'm gonna go fish take it down I'm gonna go fish

00:41:28.099 --> 00:41:32.359
naked with Jesus

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:38.640
do you see how he was groomed do you see how Peter's groomed I don't

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:46.020
know how whether I should feel bad for him or whether I should say hey dude you're propping up some bad stuff

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:51.320
right you need to go to the authorities well you know they did they got him and Peter ran away didn't you wonder

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:58.200
everybody ran dude everybody ran I am not a lace this I am not a child

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:05.000
trafficker right over and over again that lay stays is a child trafficker

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.740
fantastic and I know that there are evangelicals among Europe I wanted to be

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:17.400
so much the robber it's not it's not and sorry these are all children

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:23.099
yeah these are all children go back to the yep go for it

00:42:23.099 --> 00:42:30.019
and here's another translation he wrapped his outer garment around him before he had taken it off

00:42:30.119 --> 00:42:35.700
okay so let me get this he was sleeping he wasn't naked because he fishes naked

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:41.880
he was sleeping and when he woke up when he woke up um he took his pants off real quick and

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:47.700
put him back on yeah that makes sense maybe his underwear

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:54.240
he took his underwear off and they put him back up he took his linen his loin cloth off and he was like right and then

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:59.940
he put it back on when Jesus got there why is this kid dressing why is a

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:06.540
teenager dressing and all the church people right now I can feel I can I can

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:12.000
feel the constriction of their rectums right I can feel it

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.540
um they're gonna say oh Peter had a wife at that young age no I didn't there's no

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:24.240
record of his wife anywhere there is only the statement that Jesus treated

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:31.920
one of his in-laws it could have been his sister-in-law and which makes sense because there was

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:37.740
no she never shows up anywhere else right she doesn't mind that Peter is

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:45.599
spending the night on the boat with a bunch of kids ending up naked yeah remember when Jesus Shores up on

00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:50.760
the shore he is totally rocking a Resurrected

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:56.880
vampire body that's gorgeous oh I can't wait to show you his track

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:01.980
marks we're gonna look at those next week you mean Jesus had track marks yeah

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:07.560
yeah you what did you think they were yeah it's okay they're kids too let's go

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:14.400
to the last the very last one and just see yeah oops yeah here's a little bit look

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:21.359
um yeah oh God he's now okay here's the here's the confession are you ready

00:44:21.359 --> 00:44:27.780
um you know Jesus did a lot of other things in front of his boy companions

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:35.240
yeah um but um he and he revealed a lot of many

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:42.119
varied signs and and he was a he was a witness to the

00:44:42.119 --> 00:44:48.140
truth this guy John right the one who's writing this thing and he wrote this

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:56.960
prophetic book and what did he do he dictated everything

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:07.560
and he did so the things that he didn't talk about did so in willing silence in prudent

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:14.400
silence he didn't reveal everything oh okay

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:20.339
okay now you can see it let's bring in um let's bring in Neil Neil you've been

00:45:20.339 --> 00:45:27.599
sitting there for way too long floor thank you for the time and I'm gonna give Neil I want you to just give

00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:32.819
me firsthand I want you to tell me any reactions and then I want you to give a

00:45:32.819 --> 00:45:40.140
little presentation on some dirty monks yeah so first of all uh over 100 people 108 people watching

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:45.180
right now so that's that's big numbers right there but I wanted to say for everyone that's watching if you think

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:51.119
what he just got into was dark and deep and dirty it's just getting started it's

00:45:51.119 --> 00:45:58.020
about to get even crazier right now so first thing I want to show I have a like seven screens that I want to go

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:05.339
through something will be really quick a couple of them I'm gonna read but I just want to go through these for a particular reason I got the one on the

00:46:05.339 --> 00:46:11.760
bottom right now because you mentioned the disciple that you mentioned the young boy in the who's on Jesus's

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:18.599
shoulder and this is from the Gospel of John where it talks about this disciple whom Jesus loved or in some cases the

00:46:18.599 --> 00:46:24.240
Beloved of Jesus depending on what you're looking what passage you're looking at and he's always depicted and

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:31.500
it's described in the text as a young boy hanging on Jesus half asleep like like a

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:38.700
couple like like like like his little beloved well that's what that beloved is by the way that's what's what I'm about to get into so the Greek I'm gonna go to

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:46.020
my next screen now the Greek that they use is a term called

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:53.040
agap agapitos right beloved now you're as a you you

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:59.300
just shook your head like yup yup here we go because you know that this term is used all over the ancient Greek world

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:06.119
for young boys who are being groomed by older males the Beloved it's all over the

00:47:06.119 --> 00:47:13.380
place the Beloved of archalayas the Beloved of so and so and they use it in this in the same context in the new in

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:19.140
the in the New Testament the Beloved of Jesus so let's go to I don't want to I don't care what Bible

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:25.980
has to say about this work it's all it's all just what you know their spin let's go to uh Alice let's see what Alice says

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:34.680
about this word uh we got agapatos right okay one says that wherewith one must be

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:42.240
content hence of only children right it's always used in the context of beloved children and it's like of things

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:49.460
desirable persons beloved and one of the sources that's in here is aristophany

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:54.540
stasmaphoria and I didn't even I just found this at the last second it's the

00:47:54.540 --> 00:48:00.420
craziest text I just want to show it real quick and I want to get into some of this semen Eucharist stuff that I got

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:07.560
um but yeah so the next one I got is from Aristophanes and it's it's used in the same context

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:12.599
as beloved child and what's going on here is this priest

00:48:12.599 --> 00:48:17.819
is I don't know if you could help me out here to help me describe What's Happening Here I think this priest is

00:48:17.819 --> 00:48:25.440
about to sacrifice this child and the the mother is calling and so that's my beloved child and uh like let's just

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:31.740
read it where it says he says but you my child take off this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] robe and blame no one but your mother

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:38.940
for your death what does this mean the little girl is nothing but a skin filled with wine and a shod with Persian

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:44.960
slippers and it says and then so if you keep going it says

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.540
um are you the are you the mother of this brat she's like I carried it for 10 months you carried it I swear by Artemis

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:57.780
how much does it hold the three katsilai tell me oh what have you done you shall have

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:03.660
stripped this poor child quite naked and it is so small so small yes quite

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:10.020
small to be sure how old is it has it seen the Feast of Cups Thrice or four times it was born about the time of the

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:16.800
last dionysia but which is like a year old two years old what does that mean and it says no May Apollo be a bear my

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:22.980
witness well then we are going to burn you burn me but then I shall rip open this instantly no I adjure you don't

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:28.020
don't do anything like that rather me rather meet that rather me than that

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:34.619
what a tender mother you are but nevertheless I shall rip it open he tears open the wine skin then she starts

00:49:34.619 --> 00:49:42.240
crying oh my beloved daughter Mania hand me the sacred cup that I may at least catch the blood of my child

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.280
holds it below that's the only favor I grant you he pours the wine into the cup

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:53.400
oh out upon you pitylist what is even going on here

00:49:53.400 --> 00:50:00.060
yeah it's a bunch of women getting intoxicated for the thesmaphoria right

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:05.339
so um that's kind of the comedy relief of

00:50:05.339 --> 00:50:10.619
it is that you know they're describing the wine skin as the Beloved child right

00:50:10.619 --> 00:50:16.619
yeah so yeah and but go ahead I thought it was interesting because it's always

00:50:16.619 --> 00:50:22.560
depicting this beloved of Jesus holding the cup he's always got the cup in his hand and

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:28.200
this is the Eucharist and so like I'm gonna show us another source right now

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:34.160
from Augustine regarding the Eucharist in Carthage this is a primary source

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:41.880
from it's a Latin Source but I have the translation of it it's called on heresies by Augustine and he's uh

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:47.220
talking about this this case that happened down in Carthage this is this

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:54.599
one I gotta read it says for this reason based upon the so-called seduction of the archons myth or rather because some

00:50:54.599 --> 00:51:00.119
demand of their sacralated superstitions their elect are forced to consume a sort

00:51:00.119 --> 00:51:06.599
of Eucharist sprinkle with human seed in order that a Divine substance may be

00:51:06.599 --> 00:51:12.000
freed even from that just Ed is from other foods which they receive however

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.520
they deny that because they do this and assert as true that some others do it

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:22.859
using the name of the manichaeans okay but they are exposed at the church

00:51:22.859 --> 00:51:28.740
of Carthage as you know we we're already a deacon there at the

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:37.140
time under the prosecution of ursus the Tribune who was then prefect in the palace some were brought to trial at

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:43.800
this time a girl by the name of Margarita betrayed this Monster's ugliness and claimed that she was not

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:51.480
yet 12 years old and that she had been violated on account of this wicked right

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:59.040
so we have in one case in one situation here we have these these Bishops in

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:04.619
Carthage drinking semen and molesting young women young 12 year old girls

00:52:04.619 --> 00:52:10.740
this is in one passage like whoa like this is getting deep right here and then

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:17.760
and then it goes on to say uh that she had undergone some treatment because of the very same right first she

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:23.819
maintained that she was intact and insisted on being examined as a midwife by a midwife uh but when she was

00:52:23.819 --> 00:52:29.760
examined when her true condition was discovered she likewise gave information on the

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:35.339
that whole extremely ugly crime so she was raped and look at this at which

00:52:35.339 --> 00:52:40.920
flower is sprinkled between a couple in sexual intercourse to receive a

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:47.339
commingle with their seed this she had not heard when Margarita gave her testimony

00:52:47.339 --> 00:52:53.460
like whoa this is some crazy and look at look at this when you go down here

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:59.880
then he starts talking about some of the stuff that there that they were into um he says nevertheless they're inserted

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:06.420
the other groups to uh mannequins books of Manny that's not what I'm looking for oh here it is and then these books are

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:13.380
described monstrous things this is from the mouth of uh Augustine relating to the transformation of males

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:19.079
into females and females into males to attract and loosen through consequences

00:53:19.079 --> 00:53:25.140
uh the Prince of Darkness of both sexes so that the Divine substance which held

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:31.619
captive in them may be set free and Escape whoa

00:53:31.619 --> 00:53:37.680
both is going on over there in Carthage damn yeah yeah look people it's the

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:43.200
Mysteries right right in front of your face being brought to you those

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:51.240
Mysteries and yeah and sure enough right right at the helm of it is pedophilia yeah yeah epiphanius is saying they're

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:57.540
they're drinking semen for a reason you know what I mean so and by the way now what do you think Neil what do you think

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:05.400
you see the pedophilia right and we you know you look at Jesus and his situation

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:12.180
um how much of Christianity is the perpetuation of pedophilia you know

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:18.300
well that's what I wanted to say because to bring it back to Jesus now the depiction of Jesus and his beloved

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:26.579
boy hanging out on on his shoulder I think I think you can argue that this was

00:54:26.579 --> 00:54:32.040
the beginning of a tradition of the master and beloved master and beloved

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:37.140
and by the way when you look at these early church fathers you'll see

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:42.660
um marcion was the Beloved of Paul and then polycarp was the Beloved of marcion

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:49.740
and there's like a chain going down like you grow up as a young boy being someone's beloved you get groomed by

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:54.900
them and then once you get older and you learn now you are in charge you get a

00:54:54.900 --> 00:55:02.160
beloved and that's that's that cycle goes on and not that's the church that's the tradition it's like a it's kind of

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:08.520
like a grooming tradition in that sense and I think it starts with Jesus and his beloved I think that's the whole point

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:13.619
of John is telling you that this this is what you're supposed to do you're supposed to go and get a little child

00:55:13.619 --> 00:55:21.359
put them onto your wing and raise them to be the next the next Christian basically the next the next uh Bishop

00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:27.000
the next episcopos that's dark yeah yeah you know Heracles

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:34.200
and His Highness right and welcome back to the ancient Greek stuff like this was all happening left and right you know it

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:43.460
does it doesn't surprise me at all to see the structure um the of the organized approach to

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:49.200
grooming and raping children that doesn't surprise me at all

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:57.619
um what surprises me is that the church has for so long been able to

00:55:57.619 --> 00:56:04.920
misrepresent the classical sources to give you this phony picture that it

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:11.940
never existed the the image that you have of Jesus think of you know come on you all thought Jesus

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:19.079
I'm talking to the audience you all thought Jesus I was walking around with bearded men right you thought he was you

00:56:19.079 --> 00:56:26.579
didn't know that he was with children right you might have thought differently in your church if they had presented him

00:56:26.579 --> 00:56:32.460
that way to you you might have thought differently would you think differently Neil you were a Christian did you did

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:37.619
you ever consider I mean when you were a Christian Neil did were you thinking

00:56:37.619 --> 00:56:44.640
these are grown men yes I did and you just assume that because every

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:51.180
it's just kind of what it's assumed but once you real once you actually get into the to the evidence and realize that

00:56:51.180 --> 00:57:00.119
this these are these are kids following a 30 year old man what that's not that's we we all as a

00:57:00.119 --> 00:57:08.220
society right now in 2023 we all agree that's not cool that's actually illegal I think to to do that like and like but

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:14.819
that's that's the that's their perfect God figure that they're gonna worship and whoa like that changes some things

00:57:14.819 --> 00:57:20.819
for me right there I also have more evidence I have two more I want to show more evidence that this stuff is

00:57:20.819 --> 00:57:27.720
continuing even as the into the third and fourth Century so this is from Saint Anthony the next one I want to show

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:34.260
and it said that a Herman had a little boy living with him look boom right off the bat is there we already have a

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:39.839
Hermit with a boy living with him seeing him doing something that was not fitting don't do that but the child did

00:57:39.839 --> 00:57:44.880
not obey him seeing that he was disobedient to Herman so basically I'm just I'm basically just showing you like

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:51.960
okay even in this case of these desert fathers it's a older man living with a boy doesn't say it's his son just says

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:57.000
it's a Hermit living with a boy now the next one is where [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gets crazy I wanted to try that first for a reason

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.040
the next one this is the one that I really want to touch on get your

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:08.760
thoughts on because this is the one I saved for last because it says a lot about the church early on

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:14.760
uh can you I just wonder about can you see this one or no I'll I'll read it if you can't read it

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:19.980
it says a brother tempted by a demon went to a Hermit and said these two

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:26.520
monks over there who live together sinfully but the hermit knew that a demon was deceiving him so he called the

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:32.339
brothers to him in the evening and he put out a mat for them and covered them with a single blanket these are sons of

00:58:32.339 --> 00:58:37.380
God and holy persons basically saying how dare you blame these blame them for

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:44.579
doing you know whatever you're blaming them of they're these are these are sons of gods and holy persons shut this

00:58:44.579 --> 00:58:51.240
slandering up so they blame it on Satan right and then it says a brother said to a Hermit what am I to do for these foul

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:57.900
thoughts are killing me when a mother wants to wean her baby she smears something bitter on her breast

00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:04.319
but when the infant comes as usual to suckle he tastes the bitterness and is repelled so you ought to put bitterness

00:59:04.319 --> 00:59:10.200
into your thought the brother said to him what is bit what bitterness is this the hermit said to him the thought of

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:16.500
death and torment which is prepared in the next World for Sinners this is where it gets crazy

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:24.059
a brother asked a Hermit about thoughts of this kind this is homosexual thoughts and he says the hermit said I have never

00:59:24.059 --> 00:59:30.480
been tempted by that the brother was the brother was scandalized by him and went to the second herb and said look here

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:36.420
the hermit said this to me and I'm shocked because it is unnatural he said to him the meaning of the words of that

00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:41.579
man of God isn't on the surface go and apologize to him and you will show and

00:59:41.579 --> 00:59:49.440
we'll show you the power in his words so the brother went to the Herman and apologized to him he said forgive Me Abba Father I was a fool and I did not

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:54.780
did not say goodbye to you when I left I beg you explain to me how it is that you are not troubled by

00:59:54.780 --> 01:00:00.299
lust he's like how do you do it I'm these thoughts are killing me saying and he

01:00:00.299 --> 01:00:06.839
says uh he said therefore the reason is this since uh since ever I became a monk I

01:00:06.839 --> 01:00:13.859
have never taken my fill of bread or water or sleep and he's basically saying uh

01:00:13.859 --> 01:00:19.859
I can't see the bottom part because of my screen but it says like when when I put myself into a state of fasting and

01:00:19.859 --> 01:00:27.359
discomfort the Pricks of lust are gone so the reason why I think this is interesting is they are fighting

01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:34.559
they are fighting natural thoughts of homosexuality like they're calling it demons they're going oh my God these

01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:40.920
thoughts are killing me oh make sure you fast and don't sleep good and just live like a just just make sure you torture

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:46.460
yourself that way you won't have lust like what is going on with these people

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:52.200
why like what what is there's nothing alluring about this lifestyle at all to me

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:57.240
it sounds horrible it sounds like hell sounds like you're making yourself live

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:05.838
in hell you know isn't that am I am I crazy for thinking that no no I'm sorry

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:09.619
oh did you just get muted

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.680
I can't hear you right now maybe it's just me

01:01:18.859 --> 01:01:24.059
there we go oh no I can't hear you again is it is it

01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:31.700
on my end maybe it's on my end let's see what the chat says can you guys see him hear him

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.140
check check

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:48.359
yep you got me yeah you're back now you're back go ahead okay fantastic it's probably on my end thanks to you

01:01:48.359 --> 01:01:54.960
fantastic um no I'm sorry it's just so funny to listen to the night

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.400
you're muted again it came off

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.240
Jehovah does not want you to talk right now

01:02:07.559 --> 01:02:13.160
I'll talk okay so the one on on one hand the pedophilia thing that's just

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:20.240
disgusting the fact that you had these Hermits living out in the desert desert in the wilderness with just one boy

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:26.280
that's crazy that's weird now on the other hand two Hermits living together and having

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:31.440
those thoughts completely natural and they're fighting it to the death like

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:36.660
it's a demon that's trying to capture them and they're it's so it's like

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:43.619
there's just so many things that so that's only moving Parts here because obviously on the one hand pedophilia is

01:02:43.619 --> 01:02:49.680
just crazy horrible and disgusting but it's happening we have tons of evidence that it's happening and on the other

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:55.079
hand maybe if you just went with your who you are and not try

01:02:55.079 --> 01:03:00.480
to fight it maybe you wouldn't be that doing pedophilia like just just throwing ideas out there

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.700
but I just think it was interesting at the end he's saying these thoughts are killing me

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:11.640
what do I do how do I stop these thoughts and I'm just like that and like

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:18.480
instead of saying well pray to God or Jesus will cure you and he's basically telling him like to treat yourself like

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.640
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and don't eat any food and don't sleep and then once once you're feeling

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:31.200
really bad you won't have lust that's crazy that's insane okay okay can you

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:37.559
hear me nails yeah okay so when you let me ask you this now when you since you

01:03:37.559 --> 01:03:42.720
have that in mind when you look at Jesus's

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:48.780
advice to his young children pupils what

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:56.400
when he says look Tommy if you look at a woman and thank

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:01.920
dirty thoughts about her you might as well have raped her right

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:08.460
there right you can't notice that there's an orientation in the teaching

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:15.900
that is a very sexual orientation yeah so I think this grooming thing is part

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:21.900
of some you know this is cultural Traditions don't you think not only that

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:27.660
the abolition of the law because of that so when when like when Jesus throws that

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:32.880
out there and says you're you're screwed you'll never follow the laws of Moses

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:38.940
you are done in fact even if you think about it you've already committed it

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:45.059
so therefore the sins are actually it's in the hearts it's what you're it's

01:04:45.059 --> 01:04:51.660
what's your intentions are it's not about the flesh it's about the heart let's not get circumcised In the Flesh

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:57.420
let's get circumcised in the heart but that philosophy packed inside of it

01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:02.640
almost as an abolition of the law in the physical sense meaning you can go and do

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:10.200
those things as long as you're not consumed by it and it doesn't control you it's all Paul talks about this Paul

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:17.819
says you know you might go to a Pagan's house for dinner and they might sacrifice a meat sacrifice it to idols

01:05:17.819 --> 01:05:25.200
and don't ask don't tell cares they're basically setting themselves up for a

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:31.200
tradition in which these things are allowed in a weird sense because they

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:36.599
had this new mentality of it's all about the spiritual it's not about the

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:41.880
physical it's not about the flesh who cares what you put inside your body it's all about what you comes out of your

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:47.040
body duh and they're setting themselves up so they can do they can allow

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:53.880
themselves to do these type of things thanks that yeah I totally yeah that's a

01:05:53.880 --> 01:06:00.119
beautiful painted picture of the history now with Jesus being in the middle of

01:06:00.119 --> 01:06:05.880
all this do you how do we bring it stop how do we bring it to the point

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:11.520
um that people see these images so for two you know for 1400 years we've had

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:19.319
images maybe 1600. we've had images of the Apostles what if someone were to

01:06:19.319 --> 01:06:25.500
construct an accurate image of Jesus with his children talking about the

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:30.920
stuff that he's talking about being on that boat naked kids running around

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:39.900
getting arrested in a cemetery with again naked kids with other you know even if Peter's only 19. uh you know it

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:45.539
still doesn't excuse you know if oh well he's 19. well okay but he's passing it

01:06:45.539 --> 01:06:50.579
on to the next Generation to James and John they're the sons of that lightning

01:06:50.579 --> 01:06:55.859
that drug that we're using they're the youngest ones too so they might be like 12.

01:06:55.859 --> 01:07:01.380
yeah so can you what would happen Neil if you drew this picture for people like

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:06.480
if you used your AI and brought up pictures of it accurate historically

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:11.780
accurate or at least accurate to the texts of pictures of Jesus with the boys

01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:16.980
what would happen you get you get your 30 year old Jesus

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:22.380
31 year old John the Baptist and then a bunch of teenagers

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:27.900
and now all of a sudden and they're all getting bathed they're all bathing in the in the in the Jordan

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:33.420
and putting oil on each other and anointing each other like wait what's going on now all of a sudden the picture

01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:39.480
doesn't look like it did before these aren't a bunch of bearded old men that are trying to save that you know

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:44.940
get saved and no this is a two grown 30

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:50.760
year olds that are bathing people in the and bathing teenagers it's a little

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:57.299
different now right yeah it's very you know it reminds me of all

01:07:57.299 --> 01:08:02.339
that hullabaloo with the Boy Scouts and before that all the hullabaloo with the

01:08:02.339 --> 01:08:08.339
priests and stuff like that yeah it's how are we getting you can see the judges in Rome they would just be

01:08:08.339 --> 01:08:14.220
shaking their heads like no no this is you know same thing we you clear this

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:21.179
stuff out because the Romans arrest people people are shocked that origin Cuts is on testicles off right he

01:08:21.179 --> 01:08:27.000
doesn't want to be taken up in the legal sweep of the Christians who were taking

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.179
children and raping them they're taking orphans off the street and raping them

01:08:32.179 --> 01:08:37.620
in the under crops of the places where they're hanging out

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:42.778
oh my God and what do you do about that well the Romans just arrested them right

01:08:42.779 --> 01:08:48.359
that's just origin cuts his testicles it makes you wonder if the system was

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:53.880
designed to continue that what because every day and almost every day in the

01:08:53.880 --> 01:09:01.258
news in some City somewhere there's another Catholic priest doing the same thing again and again and again and it's

01:09:01.259 --> 01:09:08.219
been ha you can pull up any year 1983 pick a random one 1972 1941 you're gonna

01:09:08.219 --> 01:09:15.179
find a whole list of priests that got in trouble that year do you have a calendar insane that's

01:09:15.179 --> 01:09:21.060
insane we should have a calendar a sacred calendar of on every um week

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:27.960
we'll have a leader we'll dig up whatever priest it was in whatever Century that did whatever raping they

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:33.778
did then and we'll just make a whole calendar you could paper the whole you could have every day a different you

01:09:33.779 --> 01:09:40.859
know we won't call them saints we'll call them nonce and we'll say that they're you know raping the children oh

01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:47.480
my God Neil is it set up for this the mystery is itself

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:54.179
an engineered child rape Fest oh my God

01:09:54.179 --> 01:09:59.580
and Jesus is doing it from the very beginning Neil tell me this what are the

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:06.120
what are the people who were following the um following the vampires that are drinking

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:11.219
the Kitty's blood you know and wearing faces and stuff like that what what do

01:10:11.219 --> 01:10:17.820
those people think when they when they reach the point that it turns out Jesus well he was right in the middle of this

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:23.580
he was his last name could have been Epstein you know what I mean what

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:30.679
um what are people gonna do what is this how does this affect Jesus and how do we take this message to the poor

01:10:30.679 --> 01:10:37.199
evangelicals who don't realize that their lord and savior was a pedophile

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:43.699
well that's why I wanted to start off by showing that word the uh agapeas

01:10:43.699 --> 01:10:50.280
this word is being used and by John the Gospel of John for Jesus is

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:56.880
favorite disciple who's a young boy and like you think this has nothing

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:02.940
there's no impact on the Traditions that follow from this text

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:08.460
like you really think it has nothing to do with it and this is all separate I don't know about that I think you're I

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:15.480
think that's a stretch for you to say that because I I'm I what else should we do like what else is happening here you

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:22.260
mentioned about you go even deeper with yours where you talk about how on the night before he's handed over you got

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:30.719
the boy with the sin down running by and I remember the first time you showed me that I said how do I never notice this what a random

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:37.380
thing to put in there like even if Mark is not really history all right because you

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:44.699
know people will say it's just mythology they're it's a legend even if it's not the fact that this story gets attributed

01:11:44.699 --> 01:11:50.400
to Jesus says a lot about what's going on with the tradition itself

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.440
so Jesus being the beginning of this whole thing and this thing's being

01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:01.620
attributed to him and then now look what's happening as a as a as a cause

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:08.340
and effect down the road and it's you got to wonder is it because of what's how it started off I think

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:13.380
yeah I want to I want to I'm going to make

01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:19.199
that the last word and I'm gonna say to people I want people to notice that all

01:12:19.199 --> 01:12:24.239
Neil did was bring up the sources right that's all he did he just gave you the

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:29.400
sources the shocking value of it all was just from what they were reporting what

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:34.920
those sources are reporting yeah this is our key this is our key and if you wanna

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:41.159
if you want to get some more background context on how common this type of thinking was there's there's these

01:12:41.159 --> 01:12:47.159
prayer lights text erotic epigrams and that you could flip through them and

01:12:47.159 --> 01:12:53.940
it's just there's tons and tons and tons of grooming and pedophilia going down in

01:12:53.940 --> 01:13:00.239
the Greek world so Christianity is a part of that world it's coming out of that world it's the me it's the middle

01:13:00.239 --> 01:13:06.179
man between that world and the in the the new world the you know the Middle Ages like you know the world that we're

01:13:06.179 --> 01:13:13.880
in now basically so yeah there's clearly some of that stuff going on

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:20.100
gorgeous Neil thanks for coming tonight I really appreciate your time and I want

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:26.219
to tell everybody um you know I appreciate the fact that people have been people have been

01:13:26.219 --> 01:13:31.260
getting in touch with me and you know there are projects going on that people

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:37.620
