check them out when they come out but this is kind of the Bedrock of the

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:42.680
evidence that will push us forward so that people will start making the

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.720
connections and figuring out what was the actual history did you think it was

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:53.800

news of those salvation things that we

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:50.320
possess this is the gospel you mean the gospel was originally a gospel of drugs

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:58.240
you know it's hilarious to watch I'm sitting there with the Watchers and we're all watching and I tell them I

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:06.480
said I tried to tell them and they didn't listen it was backwards people right now

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.040
about one two three drug were the drugs possibly involved in this right right

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.920

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.720
the antidote immediately after getting bitten

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:36.120
um or if they had the prodot they the what they had the prodot you know you

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:43.319
can take these drugs all the time Marcus aelius did mithradates did and

00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:52.040
unfortunately when it came time for him to die he couldn't poison himself because he had so many in him

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:59.279
circulating wow that's fantastic I love that I love that Cleopatra too Cleopatra

00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:05.959
too that's what gayen talks about Cleopatra you know who she's in the line

00:16:05.959 --> 00:16:14.000
of I hear it's was it poran I'm not quite sure but somebody checked that um

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.240
Cleopatra Cleopatra oh God she couldn't kill

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:24.639
herself says Galen right she couldn't kill herself

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:30.519
that whole story of this serpent biting her that's BS

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000
right but what do we know happened um well we do know that she they found her

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.240
corpse with she'd bitten a bitten a chunk out of her

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:48.360
arm and applied a drug there that could

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:55.720
kill her fantastic she had two people with her there were two servants of her

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:02.600
yeah they'd rather die it was a a message gayen says to Augustus it was a

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.839
bird flipping the bird look both both I

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:13.880
and my closest advisors would rather

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:21.038
die than give you an ounce of what you're looking for you

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:28.600
pervert love it love it brilliant how did they do this Galen tells us the

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:34.640
magic is happening people Marcus rius is getting high all the time right and

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:41.840
everybody's noticing how are they noticing have you seen how good he looks have you seen how good he that guy

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:49.400
looks 10 years younger right and gon's like sh right nobody found out while he was

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:55.720
alive and he was giving it to his entire family says the whole Imperial

00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:03.440
family oh do you understand and will you hear will you have ears to

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:09.919

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:15.799
oh look at this um yeah yeah yeah so look gayen says um hey there's a lot of

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:22.159
panoria stuff going on out there what is that um that's when you you're doing it

00:18:22.159 --> 00:18:28.520
he says for the money you're doing it for the money and

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:33.679
he says what happens the drugs inevitably get spoiled these are very

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:42.440
precise formula with upwards of 50 to 70 ingredients they're compounds very

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:49.640
complex with measurements specific measurements right plenty plenty says

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:58.080
it's ridiculous how small the measurements of these things get right oh my goodness so you got to

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:04.159
be careful man you got to be careful and so that's what we've got hit us with the

00:19:04.159 --> 00:19:11.880
gayen says bring that last one back up again gon says look gon says look you know yeah yeah yeah and what happens um

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.120
they adulterate or they destroy whatever the they put something else in there and

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:23.480
cause a problem right you can't get it he said there's only certain people who

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.919
are in the no he uses a participle who we're in the

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:35.280
no good um go to the next one and by the way he says they do it just so they can

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:42.440
sell drugs to make money oh sell drugs to does that sound

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.880

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:53.400
is in Rome second century okay but L know look we're not here for that we're

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:59.559

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:48.200
capacity of an advantage for the body yeah yeah and it's can be taken every

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:54.240
day every day oh really that's is that what Marcus aelius is into um let's see

00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:00.559
let's see oh we're getting close we're getting close oh God go go good um so

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:07.720
the Divine Marcus look what he calls him he calls him the Divine Marcus aelius

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:15.480
that you know most of us are not so lucky as to be declared Divine while

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:22.799
alive right now in Rome yeah Emperor dies boom

00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:29.480
immortality right what do you think Heracles did why do you think they burned Heracles life did anybody notice

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:37.960
that right why didn't they show that on Disney they should have shown that should had a with his flesh coming off

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:44.640
right the poison drizzling down onto his skin yeah screaming his head off that

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:52.480
would have been the way to go I think Mel Gibson might want to do something like that um we get him to do a good

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:59.200
heracle uh yeah get next one yeah um people look at this

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:06.000
what do you use the thec for what do you use it for right um again what is the

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.080
thec it's this multic combo drug right whole bunch of ingredients um that

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:18.520
you're using daily yeah and what does it do um it

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:26.400
nourishes you it nourishes you yeah kind of in a

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:33.440
magical kind of way kind of like in Ambrosia Ambrosia you'll come out on the other side looking better than you do

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:39.320
now okay now I'm I'm I'm talking directly to my audience everybody

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:45.600
satanic congregation and anybody who wandered in is like oh God let me out

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:50.679
uh when you enter at this

00:22:50.679 --> 00:23:00.440
level yeah you're finding something that is buried in Quantum space there's

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:06.360
something of the universe that's about to come out and reveal itself and you're going to poop in your pants give me that

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:14.799
give me that next one Ry don't don't defecate chewy don't let him defecate in the ship please yes please report here

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:22.480
with a mop yeah um what are we talking about when we're talking about the drugs I just wanted you to see that gayen is

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:29.039
very precise about you know each of the drugs has an activity or activ ities

00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:35.759
things that add up to its Gospel of Salvation do you

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:43.080
understand the name of Rome keep thinking about it comes together yeah so

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:50.279
we've got the gospel right we've got the power and how things work in IGA right

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:55.559
all of that galin is considering and he's like how do we test this stuff

00:23:55.559 --> 00:24:04.640
right well um you know if you're in the right position uh you use a person who's been

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:11.120
condemned to death right and then you get that person and you know you take

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:18.279
your Venom and you use your Venom and then you give them the anote yeah and uh you know if it doesn't

00:24:18.279 --> 00:24:23.600
work no harm done yeah right because you're still

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:29.120
following Justice yeah how else you going to right

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.520
remember Cersei do you think she cared right no well so gayen says they've got

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:41.760
it to a science now with these thec drugs um they're balancers they're

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:48.240
antidotes for some of the formula on the other hand of the equation and this is

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:55.320
what nobody sees in galen's work there's a formula that you and I have looked at

00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:01.960
satanic congregation and you know know it's dressed to Nero and you know that

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:10.679
in that is the Dark Harbor and the PMA Mayes the the potion of media the

00:25:10.679 --> 00:25:16.600
communion the drug the black death um

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:23.840
that formula I'm giving you this tonight um because you can't

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:31.880
sell something is so precious the formula is mirrored the formula for the

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:39.760
Black Death is mirrored next to the thec genius of the way that andronicus

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:47.120
wrote it and a little bit headyy if you ask me yeah a little bit heavy he's you know he's showing

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:53.720
off he's showing off for his buddy Nero all right all right let's keep going

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.960
back to the text oh my mind um do you think they have name yet no I don't

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.480
think they do all right um yeah

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:13.480
so you can establish the Integrity of the usefulness of that

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:20.120
antidote right and we can do this this is where he says we can do

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:26.600
this if we you know we take criminals right who are condemned we can do that

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:33.000
or um we can do what you and I do is

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.679
not uh people with authority oh goodness I spilled all over Joey get us fire

00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:48.080
extinguisher no we don't need a fire extinguish just a okay just leave it right there um we we need to establish

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.120
with authority that this man just spilled tea all over House's kitchen um

00:26:53.120 --> 00:27:00.279
no bring that text back up and let's just keep working if we short out that's too bad uh um yeah so this is too

00:27:00.279 --> 00:27:06.919
important um look at this it's those who have the knowledge of how these things

00:27:06.919 --> 00:27:13.799
work right those are the people who can provide us with the proper curatives and

00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:21.559
the um how to mix and how to make they're the ones that can do that but of course they are the ones who have those

00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:28.159
ears to hear right those who know he says it's those who know give me the

00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:35.960
next text next text boom let's blow that up oh fantastic and what happens oh yeah

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:45.840
yeah we all know that the greater part of kingship right is that common

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:54.120
salvation that we are all looking for is everybody looking for salvation it's not just the Christians right who um want

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:59.279
and need salvation it is the Pagan

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:07.039
World um before the Christian world that gave the Christian world that drive

00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:12.240
isn't that nice look it's all backwards a bunch of druggies the gospel is

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:18.880
actually a drug mechanism isn't that nice it's like the

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:25.880
it's every evolutionary biologist wet dream right I feel everything is wet in

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:31.440
here right it's amazing it feels like we're in a cave did we did we just

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:37.039
reproduce the Cave of the nymphs I think Pythagoras that dirty creep is around

00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:42.880
here somewhere where'd he go you know what that was I think that was the Ghost of Pythagoras that

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:49.279
just spilled my tea it's disgraceful go to the next one love

00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:56.399
it you needed some relief didn't you sometimes it's too serious is that the next one F yep no that's the next next

00:28:56.399 --> 00:29:01.840
one after that good chewy excellent and oh yeah yeah yeah oh

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:09.000
I this is for okay this one is just a smash paradigms yeah just to take a take

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:19.200
a sledgehammer to the folks who think they know everything now remember um Dr pagels will tell you that

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.000
women in Antiquity you like that huge general statement like you know they're

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:33.279
all one thing um women in Antiquity uh didn't do anything but stayed inside the

00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:39.519
house and did their domestic chores which first of all just sounds funny on the surface doesn't it you know it's

00:29:39.519 --> 00:29:44.600
like that sounds like something somebody made up who maybe didn't know so much

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:51.039
yeah no it's weird so dedicated to those who say such foolish things and don't

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:56.080
know here's a little just a little evidence from Galen look pull up that

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:02.159
Galen yeah look at the top here um look at the name that's on the first line

00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:10.559
it's the sixth word in right Aran right Aran who is this oh who is

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:17.039
she what does it say about her oh it says everybody talked her up everybody

00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:23.880
talked her up she had a reputation if you know what I mean yep yep yep what'

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:30.080
they talk her up for what they talk her up for make it big they talked her up because of

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:39.080
what because she was a better philosopher than anybody around by far

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:44.720
and she had a knowledge of Plato that nobody else had

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:51.760
had yeah yeah um wait a minute women don't get educated they stay

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:58.080
inside bull yes your image hey hey P Les Dr

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:06.600
pagels your understanding of the past does not reflect the evidence so I'm

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:13.880
sorry Lucifer wants his money back give me the next one oh did you feel that

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:20.600
that was a little bit of an ARA did you feel that and everybody's like oh did people feel that ARA it went out it went

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:28.880
out from us oh I'm gonna give you one more and then I'm gonna purify again are you ready oh God yeah there's all sorts

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:35.840
there's all sorts look these things differ I brought you this because I want I wanted you to see that the powers of

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:42.760
these drugs differ and their uses um are complex gayen is just he's

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:48.440
basically saying look this is the foundation of medicine he goes back and

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:54.399
he quotes hypocrates directly and he says look this whole drug thing this is

00:31:54.399 --> 00:32:02.200
the bomb this is what makes everything work this is the energy of the freaking

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:11.440
Cosmos now do you know why the mystery Right is coming from this group

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.880

when Jesus was walking around um there the thing that you call the Torah today

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:31.079
was couple hundred years old so it had enough time to saturate a

00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:36.240
reading audience yeah and what does he say right what does John say just like

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:44.040

you will understand the name name and be able to vocalize it but you won't you

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:10.839
won't because it's not in the name it's in the function behind the

00:40:10.839 --> 00:40:20.560
name imagine if you had a wife or a mother or a daughter and that person had

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:27.280

00:42:54.319 --> 00:42:59.880
a naked one and you wonder what this is question number two

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:07.839
question number one for the first evangelist that reaches out to you the first Evangelical that tries to convert

00:43:07.839 --> 00:43:13.319
you the first one you two questions for him now the first one is what's what's

00:43:13.319 --> 00:43:22.599
that naked kid doing with Jesus in the public park at 400 am when he gets arrested what's going on yeah yeah and

00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:29.040
yeah and the other one has to do with I forget who cares let's go on I'll remember in a second I got lost

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.920
there with Jesus in the garden it's so compelling it's the other thing you're supposed to remind me to it's the other

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:41.520
thing you're supposed to ask um Evangelical yeah there's someone that

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:49.520
offers you communion you know what I mean um because it all comes down to this right here right here Mark

drink the thimon do you see that word the thimon look at that it's got two accents isn't

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.880
that nice I love it when Greek words have two accents it's like they got a little special o you know what I mean

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:14.839
like I'm gonna get I'm gonna get two pitches you know what I mean GNA roll

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:30.599
going to hurt them why are they going to be able now first of all that word thimon that's the word for a

00:44:30.599 --> 00:44:36.599
pharmacological preparation a drug um

00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:41.880
compound and what does it do it induces

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:50.119
death oh nice you mean like the black death like the black death Jesus says

00:44:50.119 --> 00:44:58.319
you can drink the potion of media and not be harmed now for some reason for some

00:44:58.319 --> 00:45:05.880
reason it's making me a little bit queasy you mean this this man this Man

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:12.559
From Galilee because of his Association his association with those

00:45:12.559 --> 00:45:18.800
boys and those what are those drug using Magi that got involved what they give

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:25.280
him he was a bunch of money and it was a ton of drugs drugs and money can you

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:32.440
imagine Christians can I just can we reason for a minute together please brothers and

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:39.319
sisters come together I'm not your brother um can we just reason together

00:45:39.319 --> 00:45:48.160
the man was given drugs and cash at his birth drugs

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:54.520
and cash by people who said they had seen a

00:45:54.520 --> 00:46:03.480
star yeah they followed his star do you get it right right is that polyr no that

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.359
star is not

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:17.280
polyonics into that cult knowledge love it let's keep going by the way Marcus

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:22.319
aelius they say he was looking so good that people started questioning what's

00:46:22.319 --> 00:46:28.559
going on and it didn't get out while he was alive but now the Emperors that follow it

00:46:28.559 --> 00:46:35.000
there's a lot more they're a lot more Loosey Goosey with the with the theak you know what I mean and they everybody

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.680
said Marcus rais is looking great brah right oh okay great fantastic um gayen

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:47.240
did have to adjust his opium you know right Marcus Aus walked

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:55.280
around always on opium chronically on opium isn't that imagine that now I know

00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:01.400
why the head of my department at my dissertation said the Romans just wouldn't do such a thing cuz nobody

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:07.319
wants to consider that they would be drug users these are the heroes of a lot of

00:47:07.319 --> 00:47:13.440
nerds yeah a lot of history nerds oh God even those philosophy nerds

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:18.520
love Marcus raus did you know your your hero was chronically

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:23.760
stoned yeah yeah now the funny thing is gayen says you can mix these things

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:29.240
together and they will have negative effects that other ingredients in the

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:37.200
formula will mify right and he says you can even have a drug that has one effect put it with

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:43.119
another drug and it he says it will do the opposite of what it did

00:47:43.119 --> 00:47:49.040
before Oh interesting that's some that's some sophisticated you know that's some

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:54.449
sophisticated chemistry and whatnot going [Music]

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.720
on

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:27.400
we bounced too close to that Supernova for a minute did you feel it oh God I

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:33.240
love it that you're here with me you know what I mean people don't realize you know you're there and you're on that

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:38.839
throne and you're boom traveling they don't understand it if you get pulled

00:48:38.839 --> 00:48:45.559
over don't pull that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on a cop let's go get your driver's license

00:48:45.559 --> 00:48:50.920
dummy all right give me that um yeah go ahead look people we look we can even

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:58.240
pull this stuff out of the what you call the Torah but is actually the sept in agent right look at this um what is what

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:04.280
does he say he says they have eyes but they're blind right and they have ears

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:11.000
but they're deaf now why is it what this is Isaiah I thought Isaiah was way back

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:18.400
dur thousand right couple Generations after Adam uh no um this is third

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:25.319
century and of course contextually right people come to you I know I know they do and they try to do

00:49:25.319 --> 00:49:33.640
things to you and I've got dolls and you can show me where they touch you on the dollies but mentally I'm talking mental

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:38.680
dolles get your mind out of the gutter mental dollies and what they do is they

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:43.799
try to make you think that this text is totally different culture totally

00:49:43.799 --> 00:49:49.119
different language than it actually is in so when you look at the language that

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:56.680
it's actually in it mirrors what's going on in the literature around it in the

00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:02.480
thir century and what are they using in the third Century they're using that

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:09.319
expression you know um you need to have ears to hear right what does that mean

00:50:09.319 --> 00:50:15.000
well you have eyes but you don't see you have ears but you don't hear right it

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.720
was not Isaiah who descended from Yan

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:27.760
Mountaintop right we'll get charl neston to play him again right it's the same thing as Moses right there he is and

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:33.799
he's going to give you this no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] look at what's in the text what does the

00:50:33.799 --> 00:50:39.760
text actually say well we see this reflected in the New Testament because

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:45.400
it's immediately preceding it people are reading this Jesus

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:52.839
Christ before he was arrested with a naked boy in a public park he was

00:50:52.839 --> 00:50:59.799
quoting um C of sources and one of them somebody you you that were popular at

00:50:59.799 --> 00:51:07.680
this time and one of them is one people don't even read it was kicked out of the cannon right Enoch right he's quoting

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:13.079
Enoch all the time he quotes Enoch more than anybody else you know what Enoch is that's the that's the book that talks

00:51:13.079 --> 00:51:18.920

then we're going to jump off here okay um look look look look look um gayin

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:39.799
every once in a while looks up from his scroll and turns away from his talking

00:53:39.799 --> 00:53:46.599
about reason and you know um things that we should be able

00:53:46.599 --> 00:53:52.400
to understand because we've come to conclusions based on our examination

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:59.400
evidence every once in a while he gets up out of that chair and he kind of reveals a little bit of his personality

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:05.920
and here he is you know and some people say oh it's pseudo G it's not again I'll let you people play with that I don't

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:12.440
care um um yeah there's as somebody who's did his dissertation on gayen see

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:19.440
this translation by the way this dissertation it's a translation and commentary I did that for my Master's

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:25.240
Degree under John Scarboro and it was a translation and commentary of gayen

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:31.559
black bile now I'll tell you just from having um worked enough Galen to

00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:39.720
appreciate who he was um this Treatise is awfully galenic there's a lot for for

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:47.119
the 10 reasons that they may find that this you know he doesn't use the this combination of words as much you know

00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:54.400
it's not in this Trea for some reason for all of those reasons there are 10 others for each of those that this is

00:54:54.400 --> 00:55:01.440
genuine G Galen so um Robert Lee appreciate the translation commentary is

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:07.640
fantastic commentary is fantastic you know it's a great commentary it's a philologist commentary all of my

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:14.880
students it's a mustre okay um nice job um but the whole introduction on whether

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:21.400
it's pseudo G or again oh God now I'm not even gonna go there I'm

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:28.079
gonna follow John scarber and say no thanks go to the next one excellent blow this thing up blow this

00:55:28.079 --> 00:55:33.799
thing up oh yeah yeah okay so look what

00:55:33.799 --> 00:55:40.680
about the applications of these drugs right um there are some that have the

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:46.520
ability to for you to Ward them off right and there are some that will kill

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:53.599
you straight up right so the thec the only reason I wanted to bring that in it's a little bit out of context the

00:55:53.599 --> 00:56:02.920
thec the um is there as that as a balancer it is not in and of itself a

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:08.880
treatment right they used it Marcus rius at least uses it like it's nourishment

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:17.039
right daily um making himself look so good and fresh right and being with it by the way

00:56:17.039 --> 00:56:23.200
it also treats depression isn't that nice you can't walk around depressed all

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:30.280
the time if you have purged um that depression that diamon

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:37.119
that power if you will um if you've purged it you can't walk around with it

00:56:37.119 --> 00:56:43.599
and that's what these drug combos are doing not just the thec on its own but

00:56:43.599 --> 00:56:48.760
um the thec paired with its black death

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:54.160
and that's the one that we as people will be discovering now in the new

00:56:54.160 --> 00:57:03.280
library that's what we'll be discovering is what it was that it was doing to you right

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:08.359
Hamilton says another 10 years um to get an AI that'll be able to put together a

00:57:08.359 --> 00:57:14.720
scientific model of what all of these interactions are and what the big

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:21.359
picture of it is 10 years oh my goodness we're g to have to speed things

00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:29.240
up I don't have do you have 10 years I don't have 10 years for this go to the next week no really what does the drug do right he

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:37.359
tells Nero he says you're you're going to be the source of this stuff right this is what gives the adamantine

00:57:37.359 --> 00:57:43.720
Freedom you want to become Adam wait a minute I thought Adam was a dude in a story with a this

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:50.839
nope you want to become Adam why do you think Paul and Jesus were talking about

00:57:50.839 --> 00:57:56.920
the second Adam why do you think they were talking like

00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:04.039
that it the story and the text were appropriated so that you would think

00:58:04.039 --> 00:58:11.079
like that when that's not where it goes to it goes back to what the atom

00:58:11.079 --> 00:58:19.160
is what is that atom the atom is what the Dark Harbor gives you the dark harur

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:25.920
will burn off your mortality yeah yeah wow did we get some

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:32.160
people I keep I keep asking people how do we do this how do we get this right

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:37.480
if nothing else for depression right little bit

not here not right we can't get all the ingredients by the way um I sent the

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:28.159
ingredients from galin to Hamilton maybe he will put something into his

01:09:28.159 --> 01:09:34.238
calculator and figure something out to do with it um but a couple of those

01:09:34.239 --> 01:09:40.838
plants you know they're not sure I know they found the sfum they found like a relative of syum or something so that's

01:09:40.839 --> 01:09:46.199

01:09:46.199 --> 01:09:52.920
but we also need that's the thec right we also need the Black Death to make the

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:58.120
formula complete for the return of the

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:04.080
cup of Lady Babylon so we have the formula recipe right there you mean this

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:13.040
is not about this is hello this is not about fulfilling prophecy no no it's

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:21.320
about making it and the fact that you didn't know that that's what happened shows that you are not a Doos you are

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.640

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:58.199
the Top Line just look at that first word toxicum right yes this is we get our word toxic from this Greek roote and

01:10:58.199 --> 01:11:03.560
the Romans because their language much like anglosaxon

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:11.320
crappy is not Advanced so they have to borrow ideas and terms right they're not

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:18.400
up at that level of sophistication yet I'm sorry and they to be honest they never really got there

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:24.880
you it's like why couldn't you no wonder they were building Huts
