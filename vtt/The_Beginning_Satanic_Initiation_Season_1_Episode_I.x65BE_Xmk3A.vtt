[Music]

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.820
and I appreciate it because Here and Now on this Sabbat

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.220
we can finally be in a place where we can function

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.180
freely and we can find that thing called

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.259
the unassailable freedom my job tonight

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.299
since you've given me your time and attention is to bring you the things

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.220
that you haven't seen or heard my job is to show you

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.540
how to have ears to hear I am here to profane

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.680
the mystery that is I'm here to make it clear to you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.899
so that you may enter into contract

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.659
with Lucifer the Morning Star

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.120
that contract is an exchange esoteric

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.580
understanding of the universe for your soul

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.720
it's very simple you must be born again

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.800
and it's my job to put you in that time machine to stuff you in that time machine and to take you

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.180
back to the place where this was all done I need you to be

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.700
able to taste the dust I need you to to smell the funk

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.480
so I need to be able to take you places that honestly other people

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.819
don't want to go or can't go

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.819
the first principle I'd like to convey to you

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.480
anyone who appears with me will appear with a head shaved

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.940
in mourning the we are in mourning

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:25.519
who died what's that I smell it's the death of Jehovah

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.319
I am going to show you what Auto current discovered

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:42.180
Otto Kern was a German classical philologist in the early 20th century

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.500
and Otto Kern said there is something being used in Antiquity this cult

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.659
language we'll call it the orphic Vox

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.700
they are hiding the mystery within the

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.940
Vox it's a language within a language it's what the pythagoreans call the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:14.000
Upsilon the left-handed and the right-handed path you can read any text

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.979
but if you read a text that is encrypted with the orphic Vox

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:29.940
you can read a text that only is only for those with ears to hear

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.820
yeah that's the expression for those of you who have ears to hear

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.720
and that's my goal tonight is to give you those ears to hear

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.000
and I'm going to do that very simply by just transporting us back I'm going to

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.160
show you a never before read text this thing has never been translated

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.639
into English I'll tell you how we found it

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:07.020
and I'll translate for you and you will be in a place that you only

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.479
you who are sitting as initiates are able to

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.180
come to hail Satan

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.780
before we begin I'd like to consult with your voice during this process

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.900
I know that you are serious and I know you want you don't want the

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.060
theories look I've been watching you you don't want the theories

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.660
you don't want the professors and the academics to come out and to tell you their theory

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:49.020
that they somehow created in the midst of some cognitive Circle jerkery

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.560
you don't want that you want the actuality it turns out the actuality the

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.440
historical reality is far more interesting than the

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.039
drama that you hear and reject instinctively you reject it I

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:14.280
know you do yeah children children

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.380
need to come as children yeah okay for the first time we're going to look on

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:28.319
this material and it's going to blow some minds of the way that people think but I'm going to ground you in a time

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:34.259
and a place where you'll never forget it and it'll make its mark on you I am

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:41.340
using the images now of the mystery

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.500
yeah yeah okay so

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.919
we're going to learn how to read some orphic Greek and and we're going to break the seal

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:58.380
we're going to break the seal and just by way to shock somebody into their

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.660
senses who's going to start watching this and participating if you've come to

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:10.500
this classroom realize you don't know anything you have not read the Bible

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.720
don't say that you have don't try to quote it you don't know what it is you

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:22.680
haven't seen it you haven't read it okay that's what I tell all the seminarian students that I have

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.560
yeah and they realize that I'm telling them the truth you haven't read it don't tell

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.979
me you have don't tell me you have if you've gone to church don't tell me you have if you know King James and the

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:42.780
smell of his underwear I don't care you haven't read it if you haven't gone

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:50.280
in the Greek and I'm not talking about I'm not talking about Bible College

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.740
and I am not talking about seminaries because

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:02.400
I mean you need to swim in the depths of the Greek and that's what I'm going to

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:10.560
do for you tonight I'm going to bridge that Gap because I can do that and here's a wonderful opportunity for

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:18.000
instead of me trying to sell you something by the way that's the test nobody gets in the door who sells stuff

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.099
right there's no sales here you can't profit I don't want your super chats

00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:30.180
okay I don't want them I'm gonna keep tabs on what you're saying I got a watchdog here who's keeping tabs on what

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:36.719
you're saying and when you say something relevant she is going to bark

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:42.300
right okay so I'm excited and I appreciate the fact that you that

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:48.660
everybody has been so supportive um hail Satan you know on that end let's

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.820
just let's just jump in and and see what we can do here do we have anything in

00:08:53.820 --> 00:09:00.740
the chat this that would be good any comments here that we need to consider

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.480
why don't you just go ahead and read it Mark it out go ahead

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:16.500
we'll get our format done let's get that snake bite we got snake we got John's apocalypse yeah okay all

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:22.980
right I see where you are you're hungry you hungry feed them they're hungry I'll feed them I apologize let's proceed

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:28.080
let's put ourselves in the time machine close door everybody's in we're good

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.660
we're locking down we're going we've got a document because we're necromancers

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:40.700
we're going to use human thought as our wave we've got a document from

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:46.800
Antiquity that we can say a few things about its date we know that it's

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:54.180
preserved by one of the early Imperial Physicians yeah and we know that it's a address to

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.820
Nero in a funny kind of way it puts Nero in

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:05.700
the place of the Divinity that you are imprecating yeah now who's gonna know

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:11.820
this nobody nobody is going to know this you can take the documents that I show

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:17.519
you you can take them to a classicist you can force them to read them to you

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:22.860
yeah but nobody studies this nobody why

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:28.019
why am I studying this and why am I bringing it to you because the Muse told me to

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:34.260
and because she very intelligently led me into right

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:39.360
into this pathway ancient pharmacology oh we have this great text so we have

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:47.339
this great text go ahead and bring up it's number three there bring that up on you yes oh and look what is this thing

00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:52.800
can I just tell you what this thing is here we go we're almost there the world

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:59.279
is almost changed but it's give it one more 30 second interval

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:04.320
um it's repeating cycle anyway um look at this people look at this

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:11.399
bring up the bring up the score here oh my God and drama who

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:19.019
said no oh my God

00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:24.480
hey color mini Helena

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:30.300
oh my God you know what that is this is the theriac

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.880
this is the Beast ceriac is the Beast look at you grubby little

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:41.160
did you so you love it you got the Beast right up front right in your face this

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.440
is the Beast it's called etheriac

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.899
does anybody know what a theriac is

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.260
does anybody know what etheriac is nobody knows yet what a theriac is or

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:03.480
they're not fast enough to type so what is it it's the word for for uh

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:10.140
serpent or beast or a wild uh dangerous thing we've translated with the word

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:18.839
beast in English but a theriac is a multi-component formula that's used in

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:25.260
religious rights and in on the medical side what you and I would call straight up medicine but

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:31.320
they're not um they're not distinguishing between medicine and religion right so when for

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.360
example when you're giving a woman bring a woman to the point of birthing that's

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:42.540
a ritual right there's singing involved in that you know we don't

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:48.060
um we don't feel that way but they did so you should understand that

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:54.480
this is what how culture transmits that spark

00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.660
as as notice called it yeah beautiful beautiful okay so our time

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:07.079
machine has come to rest and here we are we're stepping out we're going to start in the first century with Nero because

00:13:07.079 --> 00:13:12.180
we know this thing go ahead and put it up again we know this thing is written

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:18.380
um to Caesar right right it puts Caesar's name what is this it's couplets

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:23.399
couplets of verse right the theriac that

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:28.680
which is called Galena or she was called means

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:34.139
the calm the calm

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:42.360
and this author who is writing this is using a formula

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:49.560
that appears to date back to the blank Bronze Age

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:57.000
heavily mycenae and influence you know they've got all the poppy got all the poppy trade going on you

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.940
know the cypriots and the the temples of Aphrodite or or heavily heavy heavy

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:09.000
heavy on the opiates um and they're in the formula which we'll read to you we'll read it's it's

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.620
in the formula but the world is not the place that you think it is

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:22.920
yeah unless you've been there unless your feet have gotten dirty you're not going to know who the Beast is unless

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:29.700
your feet have walked in that soil and you can't do it you can't do it

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:36.779
I've watched you guys go on your shows I've watched you guys sit and listen to each other seeing how you work

00:14:36.779 --> 00:14:44.160
yeah you can't use those texts that you use right we don't even you're shut off the

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.380
only way there is the muse that's the only way you have to find

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:56.579
that pure stream they called it an antiquity and the ancient Greek preserves it and

00:14:56.579 --> 00:15:03.060
when I say ancient Greek let me just tell you something just to tell you something about me

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:10.220
and about our satanic cult and

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:18.120
you're really dipping into such depth

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:23.399
with the Greek and people say well what do you mean well um you're English

00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:30.720
your English skills your English skills are

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:37.940
um presumably maybe most of you um your English skills will be

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:43.800
a reflection of the last 800 years

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:50.220
when you're dealing with a Greek text you're dealing with several thousand years distilled into these languages

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:57.000
into this language and so the Expressions that you get and I could show you one word logos for

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.380
example you try to Define it as word and and when I show you what the definition of logos is and how it's about eight

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:09.779
pages long and hundreds of examples of different forms of the word

00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:16.019
you would be amazed you would realize oh sh I'm swimming in a deep Gulf that's

00:16:16.019 --> 00:16:24.680
where I have to get you and that's where we're gonna go with this text because I'm going to use that to hypnotize you

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:32.339
yes somebody asked how do you how do you find the Muse that's a good question

00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:39.180
that's something worth answering yeah remember in the center

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:44.820
the other tongue they call it of the temple it's the part that is that

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:54.300
carries the image the adolon in the central point of the Temple of

00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:00.079
the muse is a phallus

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:07.520
yeah yeah so how do you find the muse

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:14.900
um I would look for beauty and I would look for a a phallic Center

00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:21.900
yeah you can't get away from that Eros as we're learning magic because I'll show you a couple of magic texts and

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:27.240
you'll I mean the bad stuff too by the way I thought I should probably say in

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:32.660
all fairness we need to I need to issue a warning the material that I work with

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:40.200
the educational material that I want to expose you to it tends to be difficult

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:46.020
to digest not because the concepts are hard to

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:51.840
understand but they are so shocking to our Victorian senses

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.740
that I'm typically required to maintain a very

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:03.600
family-friendly scientific terminology for these body parts and this

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.640
processes they go through and the things that they produce and the communion

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:17.660
and when it comes down to it when people find out that the communions for the ancient Mysteries were body fluids

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:23.039
sexual fluids you know and you're reading Galen and you're like oh my

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:30.840
goodness how long is this description of the the serous component of pre-pubertal

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:39.960
male ejaculate yeah it becomes you know you realize what they're in what they're doing and

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:45.600
kind of the depths to which they go I swore when I was a grad student and I

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:52.500
was pulled into my committee um for that was overseeing my dissertation when they told me

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.900
um the head of the department Got Me by myself and they said you'll get your dissertation as long as you take out the

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:03.360
chapter on recreational drugs it was it was Pharmacy in Rome they said take out

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.580
the chapter on recreational drugs so um to get your PhD and I said why and

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:15.780
they said the head of the department said the Romans just wouldn't do such a thing I almost laughed I almost laughed

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:20.940
I had to stop and I vowed at that time to always dig

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:27.299
as deeply as I could possibly go to see the real and I've seen some um for

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:34.080
example Smyrna this is this is the perfect time for us to mention Smyrna you know the time ship is cooling we're

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:42.600

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:48.299
from the priestesses on Cyprus yeah

um the priestesses of Aphrodite and it's an oil it's an oil compounded of a

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.860
toxin that is used in arrows in scythia by

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:07.520
scythian archers and these are you know these are real Amazonian

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:13.440

00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:14.820
tell me about the Smyrna oh it's this gorgeous stuff that you it's got a beautiful any perfumers in the group and

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:20.220
I'm not all I do is read about what they did in Antiquity she probably loved this

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:25.320
they're oil-based and they use um myrrh things like myrrh and

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:31.200
frankincense as the bases for the oil for the Smyrna and they used

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:37.200
nard they used something called Syrian nard and tracking down these drugs is no

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:43.559
fun it's no fun because they're hard to identify but most of them you know thanks to the medieval list we kept a

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:50.520
pretty good track of which plants are which so yeah anyway um some Syrian nard and you know you've

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:56.220
got your opium and you've got your purple and um that's that stuff you get from the

00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:01.380
smallest that lives at the you know the Mediterranean you pull that thing up it's why the Phoenicians are the

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:08.880
Phoenicians you know why they call inflammations don't you say Heracles dogs baby that's why they've got that

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.980
purple stripe on their mouth yeah you got it sometimes the eyes

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:21.320
sometimes the eyes yeah that's that's cool stuff cool stuff

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:29.940
um we'll say that yeah we'll save that I think we're on a good train we got to go out and take the folks out into the ship

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:35.760
please pull up please pull up our text or holy text if you'll all turn with me

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:44.940
to today's hymn arthuriac of andromicus number three yep

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:51.960
there we go okay I want to read you the first couple of lines of that Colussy

00:22:54.799 --> 00:23:00.659
priyadon is a word that oh it's he's using it here

00:23:00.659 --> 00:23:06.419
to modify strength but it means like the ultimate the highest and it's used in

00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:13.679
cult it's using cult context all the time it's gorgeousness anyway

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:23.059
first couplet let me finish the second line so I can get the first couplet in

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:35.940
bring up my face yeah yeah there's no translation of this so I will translate

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:41.100
it for you fortunately I've got a couple of sheets because this is written in a

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:48.600
form very very similar to the orphic hymns the the best staters put the date on those

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:55.260
at around late Bronze Age pre-homeric yeah good stuff anyway the late people

00:23:55.260 --> 00:24:02.580
who date those things late they're guessing and they're terrible linguists because we have mycenae and influence

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:10.140
so when that's early Mycenaeans early right that's the old Greek that's this stuff that's this stuff

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:16.980
that's that's the name of a god in Mycenaean Linear B

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:22.260
um the the midday or the middle or the

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:28.740
Madeira you like that I like that anyway I saw yeah so you can see who it's addressed

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:34.679
what it's doing is it's following liturgical um performance right this is liturgy

00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:42.059
this is a direction it's a song so we're guiding the the images in the song to

00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:49.020
fit the initiation you can imagine that you're sitting yes we actually have a text that you could hear if you were

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:56.280
sitting in an ancient initiation let that sink into your head for one minute I have brought you today a text that is

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:02.460
not surfaced in 2 000 years into our language and I'm bringing you now and

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:10.740
making that 10 the temple that I say Temple that Temple of Babylon I am making that Tower

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:19.020
connecting to you through the waters okay here we go hear me clue see it's an

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:25.679
imprecation who do you normally implicate here this is what they said did you hear the Priestess she's singing

00:25:25.679 --> 00:25:33.360
now and she's got the Smyrna on and the Smyrna is on her private parts

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:40.279
and that's important because we're going to drink a mixture of her ejaculation

00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:47.520
and that is going to put us in the place where we can see everything

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:53.460
not just our Dimension but the other one that

00:25:53.520 --> 00:26:00.600
I don't know if the guy's in my dear right but the one that sits over us and occupies the same space I let him they

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:06.659
can work out the physics um but that's what that's what we're here for we're here to bring that

00:26:06.659 --> 00:26:11.760
resurrection and you say wait a minute your Resurrection are you kidding you

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:18.419
Satanist yes here's a key for the word today Satan

00:26:18.419 --> 00:26:25.620
Satan you'll be told by this the well some um mostly by the people who do the

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:32.340
Semitic languages they'll see oh God we have to figure out what this from it can't be it's got to be from Hebrew or

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:40.620
Aramaic it's kind of be no it's just saturna from Mycenaean and the road gets

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:48.480
swallowed into the new which is common so um Satan is saturnian worship it's

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:56.340
saturnian worship so get your Holiness together land on your feet and realize that we

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:01.380
have a type of mystery that is from the Bronze Age

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:07.679
that is functioning yes for your perception the thing that you

00:27:07.679 --> 00:27:16.500
should know right now that you didn't know is that Judaism and Christianity are the

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:24.559
development of satanic Bronze Age mystery cult

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.840
it's where the sons of God all got all their drugs right a lot of drugs can we

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:36.779
go to drugs yet are there any drugs we got to keep reading our texts um I've got a I've got a question let me

00:27:36.779 --> 00:27:39.620
consult the death

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:48.720
um yeah so you're you're noticing Saturn and Satan as being

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:54.419
um the same yeah very much so very much so so let's show it let's instead of me

00:27:54.419 --> 00:28:00.200
giving you BS let's just look at the text what does that text say bring the text back up number three

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:07.860
yeah hear me and who do you usually hear when the Priestess starts saying this who does she's imprecating the God that

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:14.640
you are worshiping the one whose power you are drawing down okay the witches call this drawing down

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.860
the Moon right because that's the Goddess that they drew down

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:27.000
but in our initiation in our saturnian or satanic initiation who are we calling

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.400
down who's it and it puts kaisar

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:39.960
into the place Nero interesting interesting hmm

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:46.080
sounds like an sounds like a some sort of Interest must

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:55.080
have been in the palace was Nero if his priestesses are going to be involved in cult that

00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:01.159
this court mogas of his he's called an iotro um

00:29:01.159 --> 00:29:06.900
uh a an archeatrix an uh sorry

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:13.919
um yeah an archeatrix right the first he's the highest um physician right is there

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:21.299
was a time long story short there was a time in Rome first century there's there's a Medicus or a doctor

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:28.919
who is assigned usually someone with Greek training who is assigned to the uh whoever happens to be in power whichever

00:29:28.919 --> 00:29:36.840
the Emperors happens to be in for the day right and that archmage position

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:43.380
um ultimately becomes the body physician right by the time of Galen and Marcus

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:49.260
Aurelius because that's really what Galen is he's the personal body physician anyway so it only makes sense

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:54.419
that Galen is bringing us these old you know look at this look at what Nero's

00:29:54.419 --> 00:30:00.059
look at what Nero's number one physician well look what his arch doctor

00:30:00.059 --> 00:30:05.220
said yeah um and here it is here okay let's get

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:11.240
into the formula and let's see cluthie Polo throne

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:22.700
wow what does he say yeah listen up Caesar here oh Caesar put in your ears

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:28.620
Caesar what the unassailable strength

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:33.899
of the polythonic antidote

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:39.960
the polythronic antidote is a word it just literally means many

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:47.059
Thrones but I told you I was going to teach you some orific Vox

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:53.039
and here's where we start polu thronos polu thronos

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:59.419
right polytronion that word mini throne throne

00:30:59.419 --> 00:31:04.559
is pharmacon a power

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:13.980
a throne is a seat from which power is administered a mini thrown drug

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:20.460
is a polypharmaceutical okay you could have just said that

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:28.140
but since you have ears to hear you know this is where these powers are coming from you wanted to see the Throne of

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:35.100
Satan right give me a hands up if you wanted to see the Throne of Satan

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:43.380
because that Throne is that pharmacological power that's why they call them Wizards

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:49.919
sorceresses um let me go I'm gonna go to your questions here I'm being told there's a

00:31:49.919 --> 00:31:55.559
what is that document you keep showing what is that good question what is that

00:31:55.559 --> 00:32:03.120
yeah well it's a you know German Edition of the Corpus metachorum gricorum as you

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:08.279
must know nosy bird and it comes from those Germans in the

00:32:08.279 --> 00:32:13.620
early oh it's probably 28 29 30 something like

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:19.620
that um who we're doing the body of medical works from antiquity

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:26.399
there you know we have these great medical Works nobody knows about you go to any classicist you can ask them right

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:32.159
give me some works on antidotes right there's a whole there's a whole genre on

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:37.799
antidotes alone Galen has like a 700 page book on antidotes nobody ever

00:32:37.799 --> 00:32:44.520
touches it full of full of stuff that makes you

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:49.559
it makes you wonder okay I need to take them back hurry we need to get them on

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:57.240
board with this give them a stiff injection yeah so here hear me hear the great

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:03.360
strength of the many thrown antidote

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.700
okay Caesar yeah what kind of antidote it's got a name it's got a three-word

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.120
name is

00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:18.860
ah it's beautiful The Giver of

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:24.899
unconquerable freedom or and when they say unconquerable they mean

00:33:24.899 --> 00:33:30.000
you are in a position of not being able to be overthrown

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.460
because you have no fear

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.399
no fear it turns out God was a liar

00:33:41.399 --> 00:33:48.659
Yeah in our universe take a look outside step outside the ship and take a look because in our universe

00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:56.279
of this first century where Paul reads the Septuagint in Greek because there is nothing in Hebrew he

00:33:56.279 --> 00:34:03.840
reads it in Greek and everybody quotes it in Greek um at this age we have to say what is

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:09.179
this what is the what is going on here with the words what are they showing us in the words

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:16.398
where are we going and that's what I'm trying to do here with you the giver of on

00:34:16.399 --> 00:34:23.580
unassailable Freedom wait did he just call a drug a a provider of Freedom yes

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:30.800
and I'll show you a hymn that will show you the savior through home

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.940
you can actuate the mystery

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:40.980
yeah it's amazing stuff remember we're profaning we're profaning on that next

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:48.000
line on that next line line three LD on he's he says look she's got names they

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.480
call her things in different places right that third line hilarene they call her

00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:00.780
hilare you've heard the word hilarious in English this is the original hilarious you wanna

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:06.720
know what that was that was a procession of pockets in March

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:12.859
opening the month of Mars at its apex

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:21.660
now I love it love it and who do we worship we worship civilly why do you think we're mourning

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:27.540
because he died and we're gonna raise him again

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:34.079
isn't that something who wants salvation now who wants salvation

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:41.339
um yeah they call her they also call her what gelena they call her the piece that's

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:49.380
like the piece the rest the calm and they call her El Dion El Dion comes

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:55.140
from two comes from ale prefix l meaning good or well

00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:00.859
and um Dion what looks like we think it's probably

00:36:00.859 --> 00:36:10.079
from Zeus ultimately from the word for God yeah so that which bestows the

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:16.680
L diamond yeah cool um why because you got to remember these

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:24.060
people are you've already taken a drug you've already taken the communion and you've entered a state of frenzy right

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:31.560
and you're dying so you need Galena you need the antidote

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:37.200
to bring you back right if remember oh I forgot all of

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:44.339
this is about resurrection and birth rebirth death

00:36:44.339 --> 00:36:49.560
um and your vision of the cosmos

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:57.780
something that I cannot charge you for technically your vision of the cosmos is that

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:05.660
process and this is a prison

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:13.619
this is a prison that is because we stepped out of the time ship right this is how the world is

00:37:13.619 --> 00:37:19.740
working this is how the quantum cognitive stream is flowing

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:26.420
okay so these are Resurrection death and Resurrection

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:31.859
Mysteries okay um yeah so uh

00:37:31.859 --> 00:37:36.900
um he's about to go through a list of drugs and of those drugs I just want to

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:42.000
put some of these plants up here um he mentions opium

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.560
um and remember opium's not a big deal because you know Virgil in the Georges tells us how to cultivate opium he

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:56.880
writes of work about farming and he tells us this is how you grow opium and because they're using a ton of opium

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:04.140
and Antiquity um and it's in medicine it's a huge you know killing pain is a huge deal

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:11.060
right I mean she got kicked out of the garden right forced into that episode of pain

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:19.280
right because they took away your drugs right you weren't supposed to open her eyes and make her like us

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:27.599
Bronze Age it's Bronze Age cult fantastic lots of lots of snakes he's

00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:34.980
about to talk to you about some of the snakes that are involved in the cult and he tells us in one line and one line

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:42.300
I just want to mention he tells us that these things are even more powerful

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:47.700
Galena the Syriac the Beast is more

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:55.040
powerful than any toxin of any serpent

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:02.640
yeah so these people were heavy heavy heavy flash up some serpents

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:08.780
um heavy heavy heavy um into the Venoms and in this one they add

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:14.020
scorpion venom they add scorpion venom

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:20.579
[Music] so I'm not quite sure if the guys in Pakistan who are now smoking scorpion

00:39:20.579 --> 00:39:26.240
might be able to fill you in on the intricacies of the

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:33.260
psychedelic benefits health benefits of smoking the Scorpion

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:38.820
but it's in it so the toxin is in it and remember this

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:45.900
is the Luscious part don't you want you know you want to hear it throw me up some more of the drugs what we're also talking about oh Hemlock everybody loves

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:51.540
Hemlock right yep there's the hemlock pretty green oh that's nice

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:57.900
and everybody talks about that because Socrates had to drink the hemlock right but they know it can be used at a low

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:03.780
low concentration right you just don't pound you when you compound it you make

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:12.599
it with the right dosages of everything and when you do that with the hemlock you turn yourself into a party guy right

00:40:12.599 --> 00:40:18.180
they find these people in the streets on all fours right it's legal in the

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:23.640

00:42:58.319 --> 00:43:05.819
where I get interrupted right but I want you to know this right she

00:43:05.819 --> 00:43:12.780
under the influence of the God on Sabbath is able

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:19.760
to ejaculate your Hyma of communion

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:27.800
yeah and that is part of a process that contains

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:34.200
her embryo and the drugs

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:40.680
that either killed that embryo and flushed it into your communion

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:48.500
or allowed her to produce the son of God right if that child lived

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:55.319
bathed that thing in the Viper Venom and what do you get you get two out of three dead babies is

00:43:55.319 --> 00:44:02.779
what you get right but um that third

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:10.020
that third is a giant a giant yeah

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:17.280
they they say you burn off their mortality does anybody want to know how to burn off your mortality

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:23.760
I would like to know that I would like to know it's women

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:33.119
it's women who have given us this right and this is this is before protoh Hebrew right this

00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:39.000
is this is before anything that you think is even remotely what you call Christian

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:46.500
it's the foundation for Christianity made by women right the first example we have of a

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:53.880
savior is a sotera a female savior who is the Great

00:44:53.880 --> 00:45:00.660
midwife that's right many of you out there don't know your own mother right

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:06.420
but she stands at the gate this Midwife stands at the Gateway the entrance when

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:11.540
I was kicked out of Saint Mary's University

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:18.960
and charged with um demon possession and portal opening

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:24.300
right you don't get portal opening without her

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:30.540
for those of you who want the quantum physics I don't care figure it out become Geniuses that's

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:35.880
not my bag the point is that the first savior is a woman

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:43.260
the first savior is a woman there is a good reason that Jesus is arrested

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:50.720
in a pre-dawn raid of a public park with a naked boy

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:58.619
the only thing they got it off of him was the medicated bandage that was on his privates

00:45:58.619 --> 00:46:04.079
do you know what you can do bring us the Spanish Fly can you bring us this yes

00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:09.540

its proper preparation you could take somebody who's impotent and give them a

00:46:35.579 --> 00:46:42.540
sustainable erection um uh and it put them into what they

called priapismos priapism don't you love it that guy's worshiping

00:46:48.599 --> 00:46:55.980
purpose the god of the erection yeah and what comes from purpose what

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:03.119
comes from priapus is the communion right you didn't think you'd get out of the devil's party without an Awakening

00:47:03.119 --> 00:47:09.599
did you you you get the seed the heima the essence

00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:15.599
that's what you get in the dirty dirty dirty Book of Ezekiel

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:21.780
um in the Bible hold that thought the demons below oh

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:30.180

um yeah so um

00:47:37.079 --> 00:47:42.599
let's get started shall we in the in the incantation I want to bring you

00:47:42.599 --> 00:47:49.440
speaking of Amazon's Amazonian Black Sea tribes late Bronze

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:54.900
Age I want to show you a modern

00:47:54.900 --> 00:48:00.300
um Joan of Arc and I know some of you want to see this I'm bringing you this clip

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:07.380
from newsy and thank you to the Intrepid news reporter who went out to find Joan

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:14.040
of Arc in the midst of the war and um was bold enough to have some

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:21.000
questions some great some not so great but in order for us to find Joan here

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.280
she is Joan of Arc go ahead and can we please universe it's trying to find us

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:31.560
she says if it sees her she knows what sound could come next The Wiz and bang

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:37.079
of incoming artillery spot the target dialed in and fire it's

00:48:37.079 --> 00:48:44.040
a tactic she knows well because Emerald is a sniper we met emerald in a fully blacked out

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:49.140
part of the capital Kiev Far From The Trenches she lived in for months

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:54.599
important thing coming back to her home in Kiev with no electricity feels oddly

00:48:54.599 --> 00:49:01.200
normal and so now does being a woman fighting with an otherwise all-male Squad it's

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:06.540
just me just you and a lot of man and were they always respectful to you yes

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:15.420
as a I really respect me and they said that I'm a war genius they said you're a

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:22.940
war genius yes did you have a nickname yes what ukrainians on the duck

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:31.079
Ukrainian Joan of Arc that title and her bright eyes and flaming red hair the Army emblazoned on

00:49:31.079 --> 00:49:38.160
a patch they made for her so she's you have to be pretty special

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:44.760
to get to that point when you're country calls upon you um to go do this and that's what they

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:52.020
did they looked her up because they knew how good she was in her own field now any man out there

00:49:52.020 --> 00:50:02.960
who thinks that a woman shouldn't be in the military yeah Joan proves you to be the

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:09.240
mind-controlled fool that you are yeah

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:14.700
um how do you break out of that ceiling you

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:21.060
know there's a ceiling there that says certain things have to be certain ways there's Dogma

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:27.720
the satanic Prime

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:34.260
directive is to follow reason

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:42.119
not faith you see this in the medieval Trials of

00:50:42.119 --> 00:50:49.740
the sataness that they refuse Doctrine or Dogma

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:54.780
they insist upon reason that reason is the

00:50:54.780 --> 00:51:01.800
reason is the gift of the one who doesn't lie you follow it turns out

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:07.980
Satan is called the liar but the very first liar in the Book of Genesis the

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:15.420
very first liar is God God says we don't want him to eat of that that tree because their eyes will

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:22.500
be opened and they'll be like us right he's he doesn't want them to have that

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:27.780
knowledge right and he says when this happens this will happen the devil says

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:35.760
who's the guardian right who's this Devil Dragon guy guarding the fruit right if you know the cult the Bronze

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:41.940
Age cult you'll know what that dragon is the dragon the Greek said this dragons are Temple Guardians

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:48.960
right they're usually guarding relics they have something to do with relics and you usually have Medusa

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:54.119
as a kind of class of dragon right they've

00:51:54.119 --> 00:51:59.880
got that poison they put it in their hair that puts you down immediately it's a neurotoxin they just got a Nick you

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:05.160
with that stuff right turns you to Stone so

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:11.700
Lucifer is there with the tree right and the fruit

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:17.880
and he's like no he doesn't want you to do that because your eyes will be open well what happened their eyes were

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:24.720
opened right so this is where the nag hamadi comes in

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:33.000
and kicks us all in the under on the undercarriage pointing out that that god Jehovah

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:39.180
has no foresight [Laughter] is that a simple principle the great

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:46.200
mother just told you something about the father God he's got no uh no foresight he can't see the future

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:52.260
if he could he wouldn't have put him in the garden in the first place he wouldn't have had to kick anybody out

00:52:52.260 --> 00:53:00.599
he's a failure and it turns out she's the ruler here

00:53:00.599 --> 00:53:05.760
you know and so what was what was the dragon doing

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:12.420
the dragon was guarding the fruit of Ewa right which happens to

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:18.960
me in Greek the shout of the Bakken you know the shot of the Bakken so okay

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:24.359
where are we where are we we know I just want us to take a little perspective here

00:53:24.359 --> 00:53:30.480
I need you to see that when Jesus is arrested in a public park at 4am with a

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:36.960
naked boy and a medicated rap I need you to see that there is something going on

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:42.000
here he has the boys Hyma right on his face

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.760
he asked not to take the cop something and the cop is bothering by the way

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:53.400
what's the cup we'll see if we continue reading translating

00:53:53.400 --> 00:54:01.500
um this text um to Nero we'll see this Theory act we'll see that the cup is

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:08.760
the savior they provide you with the communion they are the cup and

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:14.280
that compost or that vagina was that original cup

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:19.859
right they looked at the they looked at the uterus as the Chamber of death and

00:54:19.859 --> 00:54:26.099
it's from that death through the Savior she who guards the

00:54:26.099 --> 00:54:33.300
doorway right that phrase I stand at the doorway guess what just like money is the root

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:40.500
of all evil that is not new to the first century right it's not new the satanists we're

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:45.900
testing people with money long before Jesus was ever saying

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:52.440
um hey my name is the root of all evil those are Vox those those are the well

00:54:52.440 --> 00:55:00.440
case of the the voices of the orphic dragons in the end of today's

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:07.260
session and I want to go to questions now because I think we've looked at enough text and people have gotten enough in

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:12.660
their brain right it's enough to chew on that I'd like to go to you now so that

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:19.140
you're not just sitting there because I appreciate your time and I want to acknowledge your time and I want you to

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:24.800
ask some questions but I want your questions to be directed

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:33.980
toward that which we are venerating right we are venerating that

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:40.319
midwife that great mother who is the source of

00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:45.660
death and life and why are we doing that because this is an initiation

00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:53.640
the Romans and you're about to do this whether you like it or not you are going

00:55:53.640 --> 00:56:02.299
to meet her she is latum she is death

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:14.339
and if you know her now and sh she brings you back to life

00:56:14.339 --> 00:56:23.280
to a new birth yeah then you will have ionic life and

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:30.180
you say what is ionic life we don't have the concept today we translated that one as eternal life we

00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:35.579
took a wrong turn through the Latin it's hilarious yeah no it's ionic

00:56:35.579 --> 00:56:40.920
and the ion is outside Chronos

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:49.079
the ion is that which bounds it the pythagoreans talked about this this was their one of their contributions anyway

00:56:49.079 --> 00:56:57.000
um let's get to your questions if you want ionic life um let's talk about uh who'd like to go

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.940
ahead give me a good question here um burning off immortality are you saying

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:08.579
um woman dams are immortality no no um what they're doing is they're taking

00:57:08.579 --> 00:57:14.280
the child and they are burning off its mortality

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:20.760
we have this depicted vividly with the ellessinian Mysteries and it's a frightening process

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:26.760
frightening process and it kills two out of three so

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:31.579
um what do we do though um

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:40.020
are we killing our own children um the physics of it this is cool I read

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:47.640
this the physics of it are that you are actually entangled

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:54.599
with a number of Souls

00:57:54.599 --> 00:57:59.940
that inhabit the all of being the cosmos

00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:07.200
right and those Souls

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:12.839
can influence things that happen around you it's a it's basic ancient necromancy

00:58:12.839 --> 00:58:20.280
it's it's absolutely fantastic but if we're going to go into take you to initiation we need to we need to look at

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:26.700
that um what happens to the what happens to the soul you gotta uh

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:34.079
and the only way to figure that out is to separate you from your body right okay wait we'll get to that we'll get to

00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:39.559
that another question associated

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:49.680
okay Priestess pythia can you tell us what's in the horse cup what is the pornet it

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:55.740
seems obvious but I want to hear it from the devil's Lusty lips oh I like that that's a lot of

00:58:55.740 --> 00:59:03.059
alliteration there I applaud you um who is that from Brian Brian okay

00:59:03.059 --> 00:59:10.680
excellent a poet you make me want to smell the essence of

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:18.059
Lord Byron um yeah uh what is the cup of the pornaya right

00:59:18.059 --> 00:59:25.799
um yeah because whoever drinks of it what happens to those people

00:59:25.799 --> 00:59:31.380
yeah and who is she and they always separate her because I

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:38.940
know you're talking about Brian I know you're talking about the horror of Babylon they call her

00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:45.480
which personally I think is a terrible name um but they always want to separate her

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:51.720
from that woman who is having that child you know Joan conceived on the battlefield

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:58.740
um we all think that she's the virgin mother but um we will find that child and we will

00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:04.260
devour it right um chapter 12 of the Apocalypse remember

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:09.660
these writings belong to the sybils before they do John

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:16.740
right they're calling the early Christian syphilis for a good reason

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:22.440
okay Satanism I'm showing you the operation of Satanism which gives birth

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:29.940
to Judaism and Christianity okay let's go let's get another good

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:37.140
question have you read Pascal Beverly run off the claim that communion with semen this sword started the sex magic

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:44.160
movement Western okay um when it comes to things that I've read I listened to my advisor

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.980
um who told me the secondary stuff anything anybody else has written about it forget about

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:55.559
it right you don't need theories go back to the primary sources so unfortunately

01:00:55.559 --> 01:01:00.599
um the the depths of my knowledge come from the primary sources and I'm

01:01:00.599 --> 01:01:07.260
comfortable with those of antiquity in the Renaissance but um so that's kind of what I uh I

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:12.980
contain myself to but myself too but you had a good point

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:20.880
um yeah communion with semen yeah remember yeah we have the sources that tell us about the semen communion right

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:27.780
so we know they have a semen communion some people don't like it they're trying to tell other people to stop Nicholas is

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:33.900
using his wife just like Simon and he's got the whole thing set up where the

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:39.540
woman is the center of the mystery right that's original stuff bro that goes back

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:46.740
to Medea all right that goes back to her and so yeah it's it's original the savior is is

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:55.680
a woman right she's supposed to be a woman and why is that why is that because only her

01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:01.380
body can make the communion so are are the are these communions sax

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:06.599
communities yeah and it's pissing off certain people don't say it's it's angering the Christians

01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:12.000
right it's angering some of the Christians right the ones you know what

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.540
about the ones that are in the underground and doing you know um you know oh that's Romans they're

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:26.420
always arresting people because it's tying out somebody's taking somebody's kid off the street and abusing them

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:31.680
sexually abusing them and then you get into the you get into okay here you want

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:40.140
to go somewhere satanic I'll take you somewhere satanic I have seen a priest become possessed

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:45.480
with the devil to sodomize a boy who had been starved

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:51.900
for weeks strip naked oiled from the bottom of his feet to the top of his

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:57.839
head that's a religious that's a religious phrase by the way

01:02:57.839 --> 01:03:05.339
um used in cult right uh and uh and then sodomized now the boys task is to scream

01:03:05.339 --> 01:03:12.240
out the refutation right this is the early church this is what some of the things the Romans were

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:20.220
were uh we're bringing him up on charges for right especially in Alexandria Alexander is a hotbed for this

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:26.640
um you want to be involved with your boys you go to Alexandria it's no reason that Clements of Alexandria and pseudo

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:32.460
Clement you know talks about Jesus performing the mystery on the boys

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:39.480
right it's no wonder he talks about that a lot of stuff is coming out of the area maybe it's cultural there maybe it's I

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:45.480
don't know you have to but it's tolerated and anyway the Romans get involved because then you can't you know

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:50.640
law is law bro right so uh yeah yeah so

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:57.900
what do you do with these priests anyway what the goal of that you got to get this though this is the this is the

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:03.359
when you put that boy into that state what you're doing you've drugged him

01:04:03.359 --> 01:04:09.420
right and what you're doing is you're causing him to enter the ecstatic

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:15.000
release the orge or orgasm as you as you and I would call it

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:22.680
right and uh his when he's in that state he's supposed to renounce at that climax

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:28.260
he's supposed to shout out and renounce the devil who has possessed the priest

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:33.960
who is sodomizing him following the way of Cain right he's administering that

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:39.119
drug anally on his own medicated body part

01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:45.839
yeah and that kid is supposed to shout out he's supposed to say no and if he

01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:51.900
does then he saved forever all right and we're told by the author

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:59.040
of this that the catechism or the kid that's involved sometimes can be emotionally

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:04.260
distraught you got to give him a bat you gotta baptize match this right wash them off

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:09.420
and sometimes they're distraught for weeks right afterwards you have to talk

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:15.299
to them and they'll ask you he said they'll ask you questions why the nakedness

01:05:15.299 --> 01:05:21.420
why did I have to be naked during this whole process because Jesus was naked on the cross

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:27.900
right there's uh relationships you know it was a he was taken he they were giving him

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:34.200
anti-venom right when he don't tell anyone this this is just between us

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:41.099
but they were giving Jesus Anti-Venom on the cross there's formulas for that

01:05:41.099 --> 01:05:48.500
specific antivenom and it causes that thirst and it's from the dips ass snake

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:55.079
it causes you to be really thirsty so no wonder you're sitting there crying out about being thirsty and then you know

01:05:55.079 --> 01:06:00.660
spills is when the gay when he gets lanced um spills out a ton of water with his

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:06.900
blood right because he was drinking a lot he was thirsty he didn't want that cup

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:12.240
with that boy oh God how am I going to do this but he did it he ended up doing

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:19.400
it because he got the stuff all over his face the gallon of described you'll describe to you what pre-pube little boy

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:25.380
ejaculation is like right this is not something new saint

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:32.220
let me just add this pile this on then we got a girl I'm talking too much um back to questions

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:37.559
um uh Saint cyprian comes out of the graveyard with the Viper Venom drooling

01:06:37.559 --> 01:06:44.099
out of his butt I I'm sorry for for the for my family guest out of his rectum

01:06:44.099 --> 01:06:51.420
what else should I say out of his anus what is the proper what's the proper turn out of this whole no I don't think

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:57.599
he's no I think the most I think the the most polite term would be out of his

01:06:57.599 --> 01:07:04.319
buttocks yeah anyway he's with a couple of prostitutes so-called and he's in the

01:07:04.319 --> 01:07:10.980
cemetery was he doing the mystery you bet you bet he was

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:17.880
right get thee behind me Satan yeah so you we've got a lot to learn

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:24.720
um there's a lot that you know if we're going to grow this baby if we're going to grow this baby inside of us that's

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:30.119
the Son of God you know then that we we've got to learn our drugs and we've

01:07:30.119 --> 01:07:35.400
got to learn what they're doing um with the drugs because we've got all the specifics there and part of this

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:43.740
formula that I started reading tonight that I'll maybe continue next time talks about what time and where and how often

01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:51.119
to have intercourse during the process right because the ejaculate is the is

01:07:51.119 --> 01:07:57.180
the um I mean imagine they're taking a drug from a person

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:04.980
they're taking a drug from a person and that person's body is creating the substance that allows

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:11.460
you to kick yourself into the visual the Dual universe that exists around you'll

01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:17.818
see two sons I promise you and you'll know and once you know you'll be able to

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:23.940
speak the language then you'll understand and you'll have ears to hear

01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:30.660
you'll have ears to hear and you'll be able to calm the winds

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:37.140
right because you have Galena if you have her you have everything and

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:44.520
that's what that's what Nero's um Arts doctor is talking about he's

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:49.859
grabbing that from an ancient ancient religious right

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:55.980
um and yeah um let's let's go quickly to questions and then I don't want to take forever

01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:01.980
it's been an hour and you people have graciously given me your time but I just want to see if does anybody have any

01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:09.120
feedback do they have any any questions about gaining the ears to hear that's

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:16.400
what's what we're doing are there other ways for people who don't have access to these exotic

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:22.318
ingredients you know um this is a question that I've gotten a

01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:29.640
lot in the past two years I discussed my research with Dr Carl Rock who was the one who broke eluses that

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:35.338
hey they were using a drug it loses right and everybody's like no they could so

01:09:35.339 --> 01:09:40.440
um I send my research back and forth to him and there's been an author who has

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:48.719
taken uh my work and other people's work and woven and modern uh a modern piece

01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:53.660
on the communion yeah um

01:09:55.100 --> 01:10:01.739
and I get that question oh how do we Okay so say we're a

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:08.520
billionaire and uh we want to have access to this thing we're not going to build a giant penis-shaped rocket ship

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:13.560
we're going to build a we're going to build a drug that's going to shoot us to

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:21.239
the other side yeah yeah we're gonna come back and we're gonna we're gonna

01:10:21.239 --> 01:10:26.580
we're gonna have incredible power Quantum power we'll be able to entangle

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:32.820
everyone yeah control everything the muses voice will write everything it's gorgeousness

01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:40.860
right um yeah uh no you can't because you have to have a

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:49.140
person right you have to have her you have to have that goddess

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:56.100
who can produce for you the substance that makes you alive from death

01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:03.120
right that which brings you back that which puts you into death and brings you back you have to be able to to have that

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:08.520
Priestess that Oracle and we don't we don't have that Oracle

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:14.040
she would have to have been raised chemically I mean think of the conflict

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:19.739
think of the complexity of this ancient system

01:11:19.739 --> 01:11:26.159
they're bathing their fetus in the drugs that they themselves

01:11:26.159 --> 01:11:31.380
are using in the rights intentionally

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:38.460
to put to have a specific product um that can carry the voice that can

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:44.580
carry The Voice you know the mini Throne this is mini Throne you've seen the Throne of Satan

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:52.020
right um that seal by the way is it called trojis and you put those in your bottom

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:59.280
and they dissolve right so when it talks about breaking the seal and the Beast now that you're

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:06.060
in the right neighborhood and this is all that matters it's primary text everything else is bunk and

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:11.820
if you can't do the Greek learn it I'll teach it to you I have a bunch of students right now teaching them all

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:16.860
Greek and the ones that are aggressive they'll get there they'll get there and

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:22.400
you'll be facing Adam you'll be facing Adam

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.600
rivers and it all comes back it all comes back to

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:34.380
that medic Queen right and that's why we need her that's

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:40.080
why she is Lady Babylon that's why she is the enemy right

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:45.080
when people know that Jesus Christ

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:52.620
was arrested with a naked boy it changes their attitude I talked to a Street Preacher

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:57.960
the sheer logos sheer logos talk to the street Street Preacher about that naked

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:03.960
boy and you could see his Universe unravel

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:11.940
and you could see him left with the reality of what he had now I didn't give you any

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:18.179
theories tonight I didn't tell you my ideas I didn't tell you what I think I gave you ancient sources and tells you

01:13:18.179 --> 01:13:23.460
what they said right and that's that's where our

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:30.360
strengths will come from um I want to develop with you the audience the orphic fox

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:37.500
so that you can enter that death and resurrection and you can see her

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:42.920
visualize you can see her

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:50.100
all we have to do is kiss the devil's anus

01:13:51.600 --> 01:14:00.480
anus is a word for an assistant who prepares a drug

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:07.320
we have to kiss her she's the one who knows everything okay um I think we're gonna and I'm gonna look for any

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:12.719
brilliant last minute questions why didn't he want our eyes open

01:14:12.719 --> 01:14:18.000
um was there an actual reason given yeah he didn't want you to be like he was

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:26.340
that was the reason right right so what does that mean nice question Gina yeah Eve didn't get

01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:32.820
it she got the apple and ended up naked right she got the fruit and ended up naked

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:37.880
yeah she got it right

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:44.159
why wouldn't he want your eyes open what a great question what kind of God

01:14:44.159 --> 01:14:50.280
as long as we're blaspheming I mean consider Jehovah consider him he kicks

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:57.000
out his own wife he takes the queen and kicks her out forbids the honor

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:03.420
forbids the honor and turns into this sex-hating fiend who couldn't get it right in the first

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:10.920
place and I had to kick everybody out of paradise he's got no foresight dude dude has no

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:19.560
foresight how can we follow that it's a shame the death you know here at his death we have

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:27.060
to mourn this entity imagine an entity like that a woman hating entity right

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:33.300
from the very beginning of woman hater it's not something you got to cover your
