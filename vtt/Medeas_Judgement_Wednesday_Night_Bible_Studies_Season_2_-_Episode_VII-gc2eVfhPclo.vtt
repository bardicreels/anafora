our first issue tonight is an update coming to us from Kentucky at the end of

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.479
a Revival yes at the end of a Revival

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.320
wrote and what got started here a week ago is showing no signs of stopping

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.960
Wendy Griffith CBN News Asbury University in Wilmore Kentucky

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.420
well apparently it's infectious Lee University is already seeing a similar

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.819
move I know of many universities sending delegations there in hopes that they can catch it

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.099
a shout out to all the witches in their epoxory

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.980
um today I want to jump into right into a little bit of our present

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.200
and pulling from the past and we're pulling from the future into this moment

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.140
and at this moment I want you to be able to see what's around you and I want you

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.500
to be able to appreciate Where We Are a little bit of the museum wrapped up in

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.680
some video I'd like you to watch I want to play this first video and then I'm going to read to you

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.760
um advice an article by Vice which I think is the last

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.819
true journalistic holdout what these reporters do what these what they get

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.220
is uh you know it's a difference between what you buy in the store that's

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.519
processed and what grows out of the ground it's the real stuff it's the real stuff I want you to take a look tonight

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.900
I invite tonight we invite to a Bible study um an authority on the Bible

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.900
um and just to put the right person to set the stage for you to see

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.780
maybe maybe what it's all about an almost perfect jumble French

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.299
routinely trips over the wise Turk foolish Christian Trope whether he refers to it or not it is always running

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.239
in the background quote the most prominent apologetics Ministry in the United States was run by an abuser of

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.940
women you have perhaps the largest Christian Camp housing one of the worst super predators in American life for a

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.120
decade plus and then covering it up you could go down the line and time and time again I hear Christians say we need more

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.299
Christians in power and I'm thinking do we though close quote what he wants is more people in power who actually act

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.660
like Christians so do I he wants Christian values to govern but is not willing to call them that so he wants

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.860
our virtuous actions in the Public Square to be the kind of thing that can spring up anywhere like Athena from the head of Zeus no no not the head of Zeus

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.220
too religious too denominational we want to secular Athena to emerge from an unspecified cupboard of vanilla virtue

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.680
the cupboard is located in the back of the house we're not sure where exactly he wants to capture the vapors of civic

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.139
virtue that are seeping out of the mystery box he wants generally Christian friendly virtue without having to name

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.440
the name of Christ you can see

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.300
symbols coming forward right take the left-handed path let's follow where he

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.639
goes with it but here's the catch that doesn't exist the virtues that David

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.759
French loves and respects and fights for are virtues that are not like Melchizedek the virtues that are

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:21.180
embedded in our customs mores and laws and which are barely hanging on anymore are not quote without father or mother

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.840
our public virtues are not without genealogy they actually had a beginning of days they grew up in the black soil

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.720
of a robust Christian consensus as Francis Schaefer cogently argued and ever since the day we decided to

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.419
transplant them all into this white powdery chalk they have done quite poorly and the more they Wilt the more

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:45.138
David French lectures those Christians who want to put them back in their original soil

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:03.539
so we see what we've got in front of us and you say oh this is this is

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:08.820
ridiculous that we're having to go into this because these people don't have any influence

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.160
um no it turns out they do and it turns out your government is

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.479
being attacked right now right now um the Insurrection is happening

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:26.220
historically people we don't have um Flights of Fancy and small units over

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.740
time there are movements that rise against the government

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.160
against the powers that be and those movements start

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:45.360
through this web of what Doug Wilson is weaving yes he's an open advocate for

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.300
overthrowing the powers that God does not deem to be of his

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:58.919
standard yes yes so today the theme in the background is as the bride Burns

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:04.860
is the idea of this voice of democracy this voice of where it came from Ryan

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:12.500
how does it come out how does it bring itself to life

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:20.220
after centuries of of lying and rest under tyranny how does it bubble forth

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.120
out of the out of the soil Vice news

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.220
published an article about

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.500
Doug and his Doug and his uh

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:44.819

church I'm not why that's an e I'm not sure why that's an either or

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:15.840

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:03.779
Christ Church's culture of abuse and social control Vice has interviewed 12

former and current church members and logos students logos is what they have logos is what they have uh school they

00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:17.160

guy is bringing forward

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:28.820
um is bringing forward a form of control

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:35.820

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:59.940
capture the logos by creating an academy what they call a Classical Academy right

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:06.180
um by the you know the Romans said hey man the Christians they can't teach you

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:11.279
can't allow them to teach right and everybody's like it was because they

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:18.560
were corrupting the text in order to bring about the overthrow of the authorities

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:24.959
surprise surprise here they are with their ancient Confederate flags trying

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:30.120

Charming handsome upperclassmen by the way um this is going to be rough so hold on

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:56.180

second year they started dating and soon he said he wanted to marry her I had stars in my eyes remembers Jane

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.360
but then he got physical I was a virgin and it scared me within their first year

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.480
of dating heavy petting turned coercive sex he'd get her drunk and refuse to accept

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.660
her wishes not to have sex he refused condoms Gene who had been raised on a

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:46.140
steady diet of Purity movement books felt like she had no choice but to marry

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:52.980
him there's that entity there's that sanctity of marriage right in your face this is the sanctity right

00:11:52.980 --> 00:12:02.700
as we're going in we're getting ready to burn the bride right the sanctity of marriage this is this is

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:09.839
their idea yeah Gene who had been raised on a steady

00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:16.740
diet of Purity movement books felt like she had no choice but to marry him was somehow unclean and unworthy before they

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:23.459
got married she joined the church taking Covenant vows in front of the congregation after her vows

00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:30.060
Kirker came up and shook her hand saying how beautiful she was ew okay can I just

inappropriate and gross but watch this that's a big deal she says to men in

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:51.560
leadership they brag about how their women are more beautiful than pagan-wise

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:57.300
yeah this is now here and now right this is what's going on

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.399
the wedding leave me up there please The Wedding officiated by Wilson

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:09.060
okay was four years after she moved to Moscow starting nine months after they were

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.820
married they had a baby every other year and so the couple had four children

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:20.339
one night after their first was born her husband came home drunk after she was

00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:26.880
asleep he pulled her over lifted her nightgown she told him not tonight

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.980
that she was tired he got angry she she tried clawing away

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:38.160
then pushing him away with her arms he pinned her down so she used her legs to kick him

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:44.339
that's when he unbuttoned his pants and Jean says when he was done he passed

00:13:44.339 --> 00:13:49.800
out drunk and I locked myself in the bathroom and cried she was bruised

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:55.620
and her insides bled she called a Kirk her friend about it

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:02.579
the next day the friend attended a Christ Church Plant a Seedling congregation based in

00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:09.839
christchurch's Doctrine and culture wait a minute what remember what Tom said Thomas Jefferson

00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:15.600
said greatest threat to the fledgling American democracy is the Christian

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:22.019
church yeah look at it see it for what it is you people have gone back you've seen

00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:27.120
the bocket movements you've seen the Christianity that was oppressed and

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.760
attempted to be suppressed and put out before they burned down ROM

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:38.519
yeah yeah now you understand why the Romans were all about if it doesn't

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:44.820
interfere with government right if they're not trying to stop the government we don't care what they do

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:52.740
but it's when they step over that line Wilson is not only across that line he is Miles

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:59.579
Beyond it with an army with an army of what you and I could

00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:05.459
um could could come up with names for but maybe victims is one of one of the

00:15:05.459 --> 00:15:11.600
names you might come up with yeah I hate to put G in that category you know what I mean

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:22.560
she said the woman that she talked to said the same thing was going on in her marriage marital rape it seemed was

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:27.839
normal so Gene didn't report it Gene's husband raped her over and again a

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:33.660
couple of times a week for about a decade seriously

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:39.899
yeah wow yeah either with violence or by waiting

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:47.639
until after she took a prescription sleeping pill sometimes I'd wake up with him on me having me or I'd wake up the

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:55.260
next morning and be bleeding and see the signs Gene has since been diagnosed with PTSD

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:00.540
from sexual assault you know years into her marriage Gene

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:06.120
went to several pastors at Trinity reformed a Moscow Christ Church Plant

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.160
and told them her husband had been raping her although they did notify Christ church

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.260
leaders because her then husband's father was an elder

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:22.199
who could be disciplined and if his son continued to sin the pastors at Trinity

00:16:22.199 --> 00:16:28.680
quote all told me not to report it and that I was wrong these pastors told me a

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:34.100
wife is not allowed to tell her husband no

00:16:34.699 --> 00:16:40.380
yeah it gets worse from there they keep pressuring her

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:46.860
not to not to do anything about it it's an accepted you know thing and the

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:52.860
church Wilson comes out with comments about children being children who are

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:58.259
raped um can be married to the person who

00:16:58.259 --> 00:17:04.798
raped them for a um if they exhibit repentance and if

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:10.079
they pay a fine right there's a it's a based on a Godly law Jehovah did the

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:18.839
same stuff right it's all the trafficking right but human trafficking amazing what

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:26.220
um what does this have to do with the Bible and with Bible study and

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:32.700
with satanic initiation right what does it have to do we're going to try to make that bridge we've got another

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:39.600
we've got just about 15 minutes um but we're going to make a bridge now as we're sitting in that history and

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:46.559
we're looking at Jesus in the garden saying why is he with that naked kid and everybody has walked out of the room

00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:53.760
who has who who has any respect for what is going on right everybody's left

00:17:53.760 --> 00:18:01.620
because we got them in a garden we got him at 4am we got him with a naked boy he's

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:07.679
obviously on something he's confused and he's thrown around the word trafficker

00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:12.900
he said I'm not a trafficker I'm not a trafficker so

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:20.160
um let's figure out where do we go between his followers and the what they

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.559
produce this anti-government movement doesn't matter that's America

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:31.620
right and this is where you Brits and you Canadians no you got that funny feeling and you know you're behind us

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:39.480
right with we're the pioneers and the looks like we're the Pioneers with the uh with the the dark attempts to

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:45.419
overthrow the light of justice and and uh democracy yeah

00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:51.360
um fantastic that we have to be the leaders in that but maybe we can show them maybe we can show them anyway Doug

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.760
Doug is there with his taliban-esque approach he's very ancient

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:03.600
this is a very Christian thing it's a very Christian thing to rise up against

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:10.020
the government right the Christians will tell you that your government is based

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:15.600
in a Christian Heritage it's not democracy was the invention of a group

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.179
of people 500 years before Jesus ever pooped his

00:19:21.179 --> 00:19:28.140
diaper 500 years 500 years and those people

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:34.679
built a statue on their big hill

00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:40.380
of a woman with victory in her hands and a spear in

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:47.760
the other yeah so when Wilson speaks of Athena remember he's teaching

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:53.400
about Athena I bet you he teached in his in his Academy right he's he's pushing a

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.500
curriculum that teaches this classical Heritage imagine how much he's he's

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:06.299
lying and messing it up imagine how much sonius imagine Doug Wilson talking about

00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:11.940
Athena it's disgusting and Despicable isn't it right by the way those dudes

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:17.220
that were involved in his church getting all um getting in trouble for raping

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:23.220
underage girls and whatnot those guys were helped by his church they were

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:29.280
helped they were given resources right after all of this after the Civil

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.559
Authorities caught them right they're still supporting them why

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:40.980
why the Taliban and why here in America so we're going to make that bridge and I

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:46.260
want to jump over I want to jump over now to Ukraine and for those of you who

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:52.500
didn't see it today I want you I want to take a quick look at a an interview that

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:58.500
was done by Gnostic informant and I think that um I think that it'll be

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.960
obvious why we're doing this so Chewie hit it well I'm

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.240
not just what they think they're dead I but um yeah I'm not actually like

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:15.179
ethnically Ukrainian just surprised to people I know I know I'm a patriot

00:21:15.179 --> 00:21:20.580
obviously of Ukraine but I'm not like ethnically written I identify the grain obviously at nationality wise I was born

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:27.600
in Ukraine I was raised in Ukraine it's my country it's my people obviously but ethnically I'm Greek and I'm also

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:33.799
partially polish and partially Russian you're great I know the last bit the last bits things

00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:42.139
the person who wrote this is probably likes you ten times more now because he's also fluent in Greek

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:51.059
yeah what my father was a Greek basically full on and um yeah he was

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:58.080
killed unfortunately um in July by Russian Artillery so yeah so I don't know about like the ancestors

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:05.220
what they think it is about this whole mess but I do think like this is a generational battle it's like

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:13.080
Generations prior of ukrainians uh have fought the same battle against Russian imperialism and oppression and they

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:19.919
fought for our right to exist as a country and to rule ourselves

00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:28.740
all my life I was raised was the American flag I thought I owned Liberty and democracy

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:36.559
I thought I owned these things and today I saw somebody I saw that oracular voice

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:43.320
come right out of time and space and bring itself alive

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:51.120
yeah yeah her father was killed Anastasia's father was killed

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:58.799
by Vlad Putin Vlad Putin who is also is Anastasia

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:03.960
pointed out um connected with groups that are

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:09.000
religious groups that are pushing an LGBT

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.260
Q Plus destruction destruction total Destruction wipe them

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:23.640
out right this is the type of person who goes to the to the protests and gets the

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.860
bruises she's the one Anastasia

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:34.620
shame on us shame on us right now we have a chance we have a

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:41.419
chance to do something here we have a chance to somehow be involved with this

00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:46.620
rebirth this historic Rebirth of the

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:54.059
spirit of democracy of Athena herself right next one please so it's something

00:23:54.059 --> 00:24:01.620
we deal with I guess the same thing as they did before and I do think that ancestors of Ukrainian people I guess

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:07.380
you could say would be very proud for us continuing their fight and yeah

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:13.140
I sometimes say that Ukraine is like the Phoenix basically bird because it's just

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:18.179
revised all the time you know this is just our history you know and I hope I really hope that this time will be the

00:24:18.179 --> 00:24:25.980
last one that this time will be the one that we will actually win and they will will be forever uh seen as uh you know

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:33.419
as as what we are as you can it's very meaningful actually because we have been not heard for many many years so people

00:24:33.419 --> 00:24:39.360
did not hear us at all our our like our history the way we see it our struggle

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:46.140
so they only heard um the side of the Conqueror let's put it like that which is Russia right and

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:53.760
so for us to be heard and to be finally I guess accepted and intimated as people as a country is very important to us for

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.240
sure because it's something that we really struggled with like

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:05.700
so her ancestors the camarions

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:12.360
would bring her forward as a civil

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:18.000
to show you the future

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.600
in the present through the past these are the people that were connected

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:30.179
to those thrations these are the scythian

00:25:30.179 --> 00:25:36.120
tribes that were perpetuating the oistress

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:43.200
the oyster Mania that state of Madness where their Oracle the medwa

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:50.039
from who was Queen of Georgia right where she would bring

00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:56.580
freedom and how did she bring freedom she brought Freedom with her voice by

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:04.799
burning a bride alive yes it has to go it has to we have to repel

00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:12.120
this people have to know people have to know the murderers of the mothers and the

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:17.720
daughters are doing you and I are sitting here tonight right I'm not worried about

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:25.080
bombs coming in right but I know we are on the verge of

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:30.260
losing our Republic and tearing ourselves apart

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:36.500
I am proud that my government

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:43.500
is fighting to defend Anastasia I'm proud I'm proud there are

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:49.440
Americans who are over there right now doing their

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:58.980
thing and it's my hope it's my hope that these men and women who stand up against the foulness

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:05.880
of the Creeps whose greed compels them to kill mothers

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:12.440

00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:01.440
