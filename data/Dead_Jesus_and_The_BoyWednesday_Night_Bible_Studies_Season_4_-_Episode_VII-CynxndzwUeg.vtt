we propelled marriage Propel Eagles don't prepare

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.159
Jesus would say to our politicians today who are telling us what light bulbs we

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:35.780
can and can't use but they won't say don't murder your children someone who is so deeply into paganism is to do this

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.720
was restricted from the Privileges and rights of citizenship within the nation because they had defiled the image of

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.400
God this is how you breathe in hell it was like [Music] [Applause]

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.180
those quotes were by celsus and where we've gone tonight you know we usually

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.920
get in the ship and we go and we resurrect this dead and we talk to the dead tonight what

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:16.139
we're going to do is drag back with us everything we are going now to the present in the

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.620
second century Anno Domini also known as the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.259
year of Our Lord yes yes we're going back

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.660
we're going back some of them like to call him Yahweh right

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:42.060
but our texts say he's the curios yeah okay let's go I want to go

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.100
um Celsius can you give us a little bit and please use that Soft C on the front

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.180
Celsius right it's not kelsus you know who pronounces it that way people who don't

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.139
have classic philology that's who okay don't it it's not scythian for

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:08.220
goodness sake what kind of science do you know right it's scythian I know those are

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.699
minor points but in this Temple to the Muse in this place can we please

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.639
have it cleaned of any charlatanism right you coming here you get on that

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.860
mat and you perform that's what's important let's go to Celsius I'm going

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:33.780
to read to you just a few passages of cell system bombard you with some imagery and this is from a very good

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.300
translation by R Joseph Hoffman now this is the

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:46.139
standard one they make you get this one when you're you know in line for pretending that you have the ability to

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:54.479
dissertate to make you get this and like read this yeah love it the cult of Christ

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:00.479
tell us this about the cult of Christ you see we're in the same time we're in

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:06.600
the same time in space with Celsius that's why it's easy to bring him here

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.820
right I can drag the whole universe backward yeah

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:19.259
right we're dealing with these people again again we're fighting for civilization

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:26.580
let's see what happens The Cult of Christ is a secret society

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.880
what's the year does anybody smell the year oh yeah it's like I don't know 175.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.460
yeah 180 somewhere in that range they even debate about that

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.919
right let's just see what the man says the cult of Christ is a secret society

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:49.500
whose members title together in corners for fear of being brought to trial and

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.960
Punishment okay well at least I know where I am at

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:02.580
least I know where I am their persistence is the Persistence of a group threatened by a common danger and

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:09.180
danger is a more powerful incentive to Fraternal feeling than is any oath

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:16.319
hmm interesting tell tell me more as to their Doctrine it was originally

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:22.620
Barbarian and while even barbarians are capable of

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:30.360
discovering truth it happens to be the case the Greeks are best equipped to judge

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.400
the Merit of what passes for truth these days

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.620
he keeps bringing this up their alignment with reason

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:46.199
right their alignment with reason who are these Christians just tell me Sal

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:52.440
says what are these Christians doing in their meetings could you please tell me what are they doing in their meetings

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.599
the Christians claim to get some sort of power from pronouncing the names of

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:03.479
demons what they're in meetings pronouncing the names of demons okay

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:09.000
okay people back me up right we're all going in to this crime scene back me up

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.900
here we are okay what are they doing they're using the names for the demons or saying

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.080
certain incantations episodes

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:28.139
I love it I love it now I know where I am where's the table with the drink is

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:36.360
it a drink or something I don't care where you whereas you can you can put it anywhere you want just let's get in

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:43.200
let's get on board let's get this Throne set up yeah this is gorgeous the Christians

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:51.240
claim to get some sort of power yeah they're always incorporating in these incantations these epods remember epods

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.640
are the songs that are used in conjunction with the drugs that you and

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.940
I are seeing and the things like the mithras liturgy fantastic

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:11.279
do you have them Christians do you have them here we go they even use the name Jesus

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:18.060
and a short story about him in the formula it's no different than the mythrake Liturgy right it's the same

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:25.640
thing you can see them all look I brought you back to an early Christian orgy congratulations that's somebody

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:32.700
somebody and all I had to do was just ask this dead person just ask this dead person this is like

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:39.140
none of this nobody can say 30 year old man

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:44.899
right you can't do that because I'm just talking celsus that's all I'm doing

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:50.459
Jesus himself was thought to work Wonders by the use of magic and

00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:55.560
incantations and interestingly enough notice that the two were separate and

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.440
right away you and I Children of the modern era we don't know why those should be separate we don't know what

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:07.320
the difference between Magic and incantations is we don't know if this is part of healing religion we don't know

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.779
what this is we don't know where the drugs are we don't know what divisions are we know they're having visions the

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:21.260
prophets they're producing profits oh my goodness I'm gonna give you one more

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:30.600
only because I know you love it you guys have a sick fascination

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:36.060
sick Fascination it's like getting down to that original peel you ever pick it

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:41.519
pick it somebody else's scabs yeah

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:48.480
yeah [Music] you don't necessarily have to talk you get down to that lower level that's that

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.760
fresh invigorated flesh

00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:01.200
it's got that blood of death that's what we call we don't call it the mixture of life we call it that which

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.019
brings death on heima

00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:13.220
okay you're getting a little bit into there into their world

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:20.100
so says celsus one ought first to follow reason as a guide before accepting any

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.920
belief thank you I told them that I told them that I told them that's what the devil

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:32.519
wanted and here you are Celsius I agree with you Celsius good man good man typical

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:38.519
nice Pagan love to meet his parents this is wonderful one art one ought first to

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:45.420
follow reason as a guide before accepting any belief since anyone who believes without testing a Doctrine is

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:52.740
certain to be deceived come on guys be scientists right it's no problem no problem we have

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:59.100
plenty of examples in our own time right look at who he starts to compare

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:06.300
them with Sibley the soothsayers the worshipers of mithras sebasius wait a minute you mean

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:16.019
all of these mystery Cults that we've been talking about you mean there's an ancient person who

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:25.740
is comparing Christianity no he's not comparing Christianity he's saying Christianity is one mystery practice

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:31.920
yeah so when you say that the early Christians

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:40.440
are using magic and Paul is running around with his you know he's like you've been Dover let me make you stop

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:46.459
using your books like some kind of sick you know

00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:53.820
school principle you know what I'm talking about that kind that kind

00:12:53.820 --> 00:13:00.360
um yeah Celsius and these guys are noticing these things right they're noticing it and they're saying look you

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:09.060
know you gotta these people should be ashamed for a lot of stuff that they're doing rise a lot of the stuff yeah excellent I

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:16.339
want to just in case look in case there was anybody sitting here because still

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:25.560
is in that one section in the nosebleed section that we reserved

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:33.959
for the true believers you know that we've that section has always got to be made available right or

00:13:33.959 --> 00:13:39.120
we're not going to have any sort of progress so we've got that section available for

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:44.339
anybody in that section who is still in the least sympathetic

00:13:44.339 --> 00:13:49.380
to the fact that Jesus is arrested in a public park with a naked boy

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:56.100
okay I want to give you the words of a dead

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:02.100
pagan who said everybody knows what they do

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:09.120
with the boys Christians included don't you see

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:15.560
The Cult of Jesus is the cult of antinous

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:23.399
Heracles here he is isn't he hot here he is you know who this is this is antinous

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:29.760
he's a real person right don't think that you're sitting around we know we don't spend any time with myth we're

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.579
thrilled people baby we're with Queens Amazonian queens and antinous can I get

00:14:35.579 --> 00:14:41.339
him back from let me summon antennas back look at this I want you guys to get I want you to feel it as you're sitting

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:47.040
on that throne right as you're sitting on that Throne look at look at him

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:54.600
looking at him just feel and tenuous and tenuous you know who he was

00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:02.279
he was the boy lover of Hadrian whom he picked up

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:09.420
and brought back for his education look everybody knew

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:14.519
nothing was hidden because nobody cared

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:22.220
yeah nobody cared nobody cared

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:29.699
yeah so we have a pagan who says hey this is your Jesus your Jesus they celebrate

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:35.160
those Christians are doing let me just read it let me just read it to you

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:42.120
chewy give him some stuff to to get the brain going yeah

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:49.440
the honor they pay to Jesus is no different from the sort paid to

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:55.440
Hadrian's favorite boy antinos hmm

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:01.160
yes did Jesus have a

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:08.220
male lover with whom he was in a pederastic relationship

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:14.220
that's the question that we're asking now sitting in this conference room we

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.860
want to know look we got a trans-dimensional stuff is going to come through the pipe and we got to let them

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:25.380
know where we are right and I'm saying part of this

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:30.620
investigation has to do with the naked kid in a public park

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:38.120
okay part of it has to do with the guy who was caught touching children

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:44.759
aggressively and had the whole group of parents they stop and he stood up and said what are you

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:49.940
gonna scandalize me you want to scandalize me

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:57.600
I am not a laces yeah okay and you say how long did it

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.720
take for that crowd to form when Jesus was getting taken off to get crucified how long did

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:10.740
those guys show up how bad did they punch him in the face okay he got crucified between two two

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:16.980
other ones huh all right interesting interesting

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:24.418
let me read that again the honor they paid to Jesus is no different from the short paid to Hadrian's favorite boy and

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:31.020
Tennis now you're saying naked boy naked boy

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:36.660
with Jesus in a garden right public park

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:42.240
give me another one right we have to build we're building a

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:47.940
picture so we need things like motive we need to construct motive based upon

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:53.520
evidence and only from evidence that we've got we have this 16th chapter of

00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:00.360
Mark where guess what another neoniscos comes in and by the way let me just let

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:05.820
me just put this down here Paul take down your pants nope I don't know Paul

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.880
that's not how it works right daddy says Paul

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.740
daddy says take him down

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:22.559
Okay the reason we have to do that is because somebody has snuck in and I said

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:28.080
that naked kid that was with Jesus cannot be a kid he's he's got to be a 30

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:35.120
year old mature male undergoing a weekend seminar in a cemetery

00:18:36.679 --> 00:18:44.880
the word for young man in Greek is neonias when you put the sigma Kappa

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:51.780
onto it you've created a a different word because Sigma Kappa is a diminutive

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:57.720
it's what we call diminutive so in Greek you have a pis a child a child and then

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:03.059
you have a pie discus what is it what is a child what is a pie this course it's a

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:11.220
diminutive for child a little kiddo a little kiddo right so you also have an

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:16.860

yeah there we go everybody translates this I just want you to see

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:31.740
um it's a demonstrative adverb look at the top demonstrative adverb is just

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:41.760
such a one right so it's the demonstrative adverb form of that so in this way or thus you know thusly look at

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:49.380
number two of a state or condition as it is I like you for who you are that for

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:56.820
who you are is this holiday the thing sitting there as it is what is

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:05.880

and say that no no he's been woken up he's new this is not him

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:26.539
this is not him oh my goodness that thing is translated traditionally as an adverb he's not here

00:26:26.539 --> 00:26:32.279
he's not here but why is the boy sitting on the right hand of somebody who's not

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:38.940

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:58.679

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:49.919
happens in the next in the next uh yeah yeah um

00:28:49.919 --> 00:28:55.500
so they got up early and Sabbath and they went and uh Mary saw right

00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:00.720
um he went to her first anyway um I want to get when they're running out

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:07.380
yeah and so he says to them you know behold Jesus the Nazarene you know what I mean

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:16.140
the one that's crucifying he's up and this isn't him this form is in him look at the place where he's buried but some

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:23.460
um they said to this to students of him go out and say the students and Peter um to bring yourselves right to Galilee

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:28.559
he's going to go before you he's going to go into Galley wait what Jesus is

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:34.440
going into Galilee okay okay and then what's the very next

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:40.740
sentence and they went out and fled in Terror

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:48.140
they're tromos they're shaking they're shaking it says they ran away

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:53.640
they ran away and refused to even tell anyone

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:58.799
about what happened right this is Mary Magdalene right

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:04.919
Salome a couple others and they're standing there and they see

00:30:04.919 --> 00:30:10.260
this kid and all of a sudden a terror hits them a

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:17.100
terror hits them I wonder what they were fumigating that place with was it something ecstatic was it something that

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:22.140
they were using and you think oh no no not watched I want to catch you right

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:28.440
now I'm gonna chain you up and I'm gonna spank you right you say no no they

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:34.980
didn't it wasn't they weren't using those drugs no they couldn't have we couldn't have gone there

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:42.960
yes take a look at what the Greek says right says they were

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:50.159
Thomas they had a shake and they were in estasis

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:54.440
they were in ecstasy

00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:04.320
they were in ecstasy no this is Christian these cannot be those rights of the pagans no well guess what Mary

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:13.020
got high in Jesus's Doom she became ecstatic

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:18.960
yeah this is when you start seeing visions and stuff what do you think that kid was doing sitting there

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:25.140
right you got to see those Visions you see the system that was around Jesus and the

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:31.020
performance of his mystery do you see the system that was functioning that was operating

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:37.320
right that kid was there for a reason and Celsius is screaming at the world

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:43.380
