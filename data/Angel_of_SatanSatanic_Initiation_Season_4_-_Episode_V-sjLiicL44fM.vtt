00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:04.200
this Angel do now for those of you who are thinking okay I'm too deep into this narrative I'm gone I don't know where I

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:10.440
am I forgot that we were at a ritual um I forgot there were no vicious I

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.720
forgot that there was an initiation right I'm I'm losing the picture for

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:23.820
those of you who are at that place let's just go back to what's actually happening and that's what this text gives us this ain't Angelos right this

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:30.359
Angel he did what he grabbed up some lebanaton right and a lot of people a lot of the

00:38:30.359 --> 00:38:35.400
translations will give this to you as some kind of sensor or something to burn something in

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:41.400
yeah um only because it's post after the fact right

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:47.820
um so he took some Lee banats on and let's just look at what leaving Otto says frankincense yeah frankincense

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:53.520
guess what the Magi are still there people can you smell them when that Magi

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:59.220
came in and farted everybody smelled it for a week right that's the place we are

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:06.740
historically here's the frankincense with him right and look at it also means look at the very bottom number three

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:13.500
what the what is it well I told my I'm telling all of my Greek students right

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:19.680
that they that everything in Greek um Can goes back to some verb right

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:26.400
they're verb heavy for deriving um words and developing Concepts so it's

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:33.359
very verb heavy you just go back to the verbs and see what does it mean to to believe in Ortiz or something it means

00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:38.880
to fumigate with frankincense sense to fumigate it and what does it fumigate

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:43.980
remember the scythians they don't take baths they take they fumigate themselves

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:52.020
cannabis right isn't that nice they fumigate themselves and who did we read a couple a couple of

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:57.300
days ago who did we read was the origin of fumigation who did they say was the

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:03.960
origin of fumigation that was cimaranas right so we're performing something they

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:10.020
were doing they were doing the queen of Babylon was doing right the medwa was

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:16.560
the queen of Babylon she is fumigating you fumigating you let's go back to the

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:22.079
text well yeah and um nope nice one down

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:28.440
no no did we miss what was that one we were just at here leaving them out okay

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:33.599
um yeah so yeah I want you guys to see that this frankincense is a part big

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:40.079
part of the picture and it gets so crazy that the frankincense is used to be able

00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:45.140
to see the future so there are

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:51.480
manes their appear their mantics who are entering a

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:56.820
frankincense Mania a frankincense Mania

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:01.920
right okay and um that's because they've been fumigated

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:07.920
one too many times and libano Mana is the really the grain now here we're

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:14.640
going to crack something those of you are going to say oh oh this is Hebrew oh Manna is Hebrew right

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:19.740
you fell into the same trap right there you are in Assad's Palace and he's got

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:26.820
you down there he's got you tied up he's doing things you got to take what's in that bowl that the priest pushes out

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:33.660
into the hallway you got to take what's in that um and give it to the other guy and the

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:40.560
other guy will smear it all over his body and um you know it's a thing it's a thing

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:49.619
welcome to the world of decide those of you who thought that was the picture Mana Manna is not a Hebrew word it's a

00:41:49.619 --> 00:41:55.079
Greek word that was there before the earliest Proto Hebrew

00:41:55.079 --> 00:42:01.140
yes but you only believed it because you took the masoretic path you followed

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:07.200
King James even if you didn't care right that's just the way you were pushed so

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:12.780
yeah what are those what is mana mana is actually a granular form it's a type of

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:19.260
when you take the drug and you can break it into a powder you can prepare it as a

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:24.480
powder or some kind of granule in order to burn those right that's what they're

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:29.940
talking about with that Manna so the frankincense Manna is simply that

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:35.339
powdered frankincense and if we can put back up a couple more let's

00:42:35.339 --> 00:42:41.760
from where we were put up where we were good look at what this is leaving omantis what's it leaving on mantis you

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:47.220
didn't believe me when I said this but here here this person is one that divines from the smoke of Frankincense

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:53.280
so these Magi that were high right because all Magi are high all the

00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:01.140
time right what do they do for what do they do for um Jesus right they're giving him the

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:06.500
drugs that he will need to kick himself

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:15.780
into Uranus to be that son well you see how it works you can't be

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:20.900
the Christo somebody this week was telling me that a classicist told them

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:28.800
it turns out this this person was in classist anyway they're a new testament scholar right and

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:37.200
um a new testament scar who's been reading Josephus did somebody just crack one it smells like dirty rotten onions

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:46.079
in here sulfur to purify this place bro right when I hear somebody's red Josephus

00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:52.430
or translated Josephus I smell the fart of eggs

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:59.099
[Music] yeah I do when somebody quotes Josephus what you

00:43:59.099 --> 00:44:05.539
need to do is realize that an angel just farted in your face

00:44:06.119 --> 00:44:12.900
yeah right in your face it's not funny

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:19.859
it's not funny it's not it's you can stop Angel farting

00:44:19.859 --> 00:44:25.980
okay all right we have to we have to do the Greek and this person was saying oh

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:33.599
Christ it just means to be rubbed with oil mashiach right it starts quoting some things that

00:44:33.599 --> 00:44:41.579
are not in the text and have nothing to do with the words no the Greeks if this guy had read more than Josephus he would

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:50.180
know that aletho is the common word for rubbing oil into somebody

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:56.220
comes originally from the word that means to be stung by

00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:01.500
the godfly when you have the

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:07.079
thorn in your flesh [Music]

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:13.440
you are invincible you are invincible and you have that

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:19.260
Oracle of Jehovah you've got his Oracle you've got that place open

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:24.960
right next thing you know you'll get the flocks in your eyes

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:31.260
you'll get those Brazen feet you get those Brazen feet and what's he doing

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:38.880
with those Brazen feet right you know it's we need to realize that this is People

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:46.079
Are People and that what we've got is a cult full of drugged out sex maniacs

00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:51.660
and once you come to those that understanding when you see those

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:57.359
parameters of what your religion is it it kind of makes uh

00:45:57.359 --> 00:46:02.760
makes a lot more sense yeah it makes a lot more sense

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:09.839
um and all of a sudden those funny odd passages that have what and we don't really not translate them shame on you

00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:16.680
people shame on you Scholars that you didn't give this information this is okay do we have any more texts I know

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:23.339
this is we're going awfully long I just want you to see that this Mania can also just come from another boisterous

00:46:23.339 --> 00:46:31.020
another sting another gad fly right how did she prophesy she prophesies your

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:36.060
honor through the power of that ostrus

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:43.380
now wait bring that back up I want everybody to see this look at if you look up mana right you'll get right away

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:49.500
a division a and two and one of them uh appears to be

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:56.760
um based upon really hardcore Greek text look at the first ones mentioned diascortis diascortis he's a doctor

00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:03.359
right who deals in drugs he writes about drugs that's his thing right

00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:09.300
um look at Hippocrates is in here using it right or a basis Orab is orobasius

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:15.540
that's the personal physician of Julian the apostate right look Galen that's the

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:24.000
personal physician of Marcus Aurelius yeah so this word is used from an older

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:31.140
Greek meaning which then they had to the victorians had to say well wait a minute we know that half of us are Bible

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:37.619
scholars and they're going to want to say this is from Hebrew garbage

00:47:37.619 --> 00:47:43.440
garbage garbage I defined you to find me a word in English like that

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:49.859
now that has magical roots in a different language no no that's just bad Linguistics bro

00:47:49.859 --> 00:47:56.280
that is just appropriation from the mazarites right this has got to be the holy Hebrew

00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:02.880
Hebrews got to be the holy language you can't be not the oldest right it can't be

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:09.359
and if it makes you feel any better you want to trace your you want to trace those roots through the through Babylon

00:48:09.359 --> 00:48:16.140
through ER nah dude dude this mystery is being

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:22.319
performed before before your people and before the people

00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:31.680
that came before your people yeah this is old this is old stuff right

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:39.000
so if you're gonna argue if you're gonna argue linguistics don't use the ones that are made up

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.280
don't use the tools that are made up get the science going

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:51.359
all right did you see how that word Mana is used within the medicine do you see all those doctors I just showed you

00:48:51.359 --> 00:48:56.240
guess what Bible scholars don't read

00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:03.359
they don't read this stuff you are getting information that nobody

00:49:03.359 --> 00:49:09.839
else is getting this opens up a reality that you didn't

00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:16.500

in sexual gratification while under the influence of mind altering drugs your

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:59.040

mystery yes yes for the next time we meet

00:50:57.119 --> 00:51:05.160
we will be looking at our ability to revive the mystery and

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:11.940
we're going to do that by looking at people who've done it in the past and who wrote about it and wrote about

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:18.180
the experience and people who entered into it and the people who didn't like him the people who tried to shut them

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:23.220
down so we'll get a little bit of the you get a little bit of the history of the
