thing love it anyway let's keep going um and uh what do they do when they're in this moment when they're in the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.620
mystery right I heard another scholar today talking about we don't know it's the Mysteries it's mysterious you guys

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.739
are pathetic you're pathetic um they will prophesy right they'll be

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.500
that Prophet they'll be able to tell you beforehand right and who's well tell me

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.799

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.200
prophesying that's not and your Nanny score your young people right what are

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.360
they gonna do they're gonna dream dreams right off sometimes excuse me they're

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.400
gonna see the Visions what I says the things to be seen right they're gonna

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.480
have divisions and what are the Presbyterian what are those people doing the old people right the old people

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.939
they're in that incubation

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:20.340
right that's a kind of a really beautiful concept the Greeks have of

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.440
entering into the temple in order to find that place of healing you can take

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.580
it down to find that place of healing and to come through a vision

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.320
yeah you're entering that right so um we are entering a phase in that final

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:46.680
eschatod right the culmination we are you know the purpose right this

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.520
is one of celsius's big arguments with the uh with the Christians is that you

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.580
know the Divine can't act contrary to Nature right so it's got to make sense

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.720
and it's got to be according to you know what you see around it's got to mesh with what you see no fairy tales right

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.259
we don't we don't follow that fairy tale stuff um to jump to the Christians right away

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:21.180
I want to introduce them now and for those of you who've come who know already Jesus Christ was arrested in a public

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:29.039
park in the early hours of the morning um in a pre-dawn raid pretty significant

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:35.940
calls himself a child trafficker um we're at that point now that we're

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.639
gonna you know we've got to come to climax here tonight we've got to reach the point so I want you to we're going

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:48.060
to get in we're going to see these drug users for what they are what they're doing we're gonna smell we're gonna

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:55.259
taste we're gonna do everything that they're doing so I'm gonna pull out Celsius just for a short quote just for

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:01.800
a short quote right um I just want you to listen to it talking about the Christians he says

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.160
they are really very dishonest borrowing even their incantations

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.800
from other religions in their magic Acts so there's a couple of things that are

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:21.900
fantastic about that number one they're doing magic acts right right so and number two they are

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.060
borrowing right they're borrowing this is what drives a nuts they're

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:34.740
incantations these are the incantations that the Christians are doing you're like wait wait stop stop the ship but

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.039
you know wait I don't feel good a little bit queasy it doesn't make sense right um yeah the Christians are doing

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:46.520
incantations now I want to show you this video I want to launch you from Celsius

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:53.220

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:13.860
Bronze Age good good oh this is the old-fashioned religion oh this is this

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:19.920

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:46.980
this is line 245. Alexa Cochran right

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:53.279
um he's shaking something from his hands right he shakes from his hands what kind

00:15:53.279 --> 00:16:03.540
of hands does he have he have he has hands that are antidotal not anecdotal but antidotal

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:10.560
it's the what it's saying literally it's not literally in the modern sense anything can be literal right

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:17.100
any um in the actual sense yeah

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:22.500
it's the antidote he's got the antidote on his hands what's going on and who's

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:31.800
this he yeah ophiuchus yeah so he shakes off he shakes off

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:38.459
he has a little seismic trimmer yeah and he shakes off the uh

00:16:38.459 --> 00:16:48.720
uh um uh translated back yeah he's he's taking

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:55.620
away the power he's putting off the back yeah

00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:05.220
of the what the back of what the back of the fire nourished dragons

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:11.400
wow okay so I'm a little bit confused right and it because this comes across in Translation what read your

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:17.520
translation of it and you'll see it's oh this is it's a little bit messy for what's going on what is this person

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.558
doing right he then takes out and activates

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:28.799
his bow yeah he activates his bow he sends out

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:33.900
that ready keep your analog going people because you're right we're getting to

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:39.419
the images that you need he takes out his curved Arrow

00:17:39.419 --> 00:17:45.000
right he is hitting on the loxius they call him loxius Apollo

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.620
because of his oblique nature

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:57.360
yes yeah Apollo prophesies in the oblique

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:04.500
when that Priestess the pythia like the one that was screaming at Paul yeah

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:11.880
um they prophesy in what's called in the oblique they are loxian

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:19.260
yeah good so um that last line there at the bottom I

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:25.320
just want you to notice oystoy uh-huh that word in the end there

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:33.960
um these arrows these Viperine or Viper derived arrows

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:43.140
of the oblique nature of Apollo when they are used they bakero

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:49.140
the air they turn the air into the bucket Mania

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:55.380
Okay so we've all been together and with these Clues you can see a

00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:02.100
picture that's emerging of the right and you can see an understanding the

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:07.679
number one they're using venoms right they're using Venoms and like our

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:14.360
guys from last week who are using the purple they're seeing visions

00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:23.880
and these Visions are oracular and they go back to the fire nourished

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:29.940
dragons yeah and remember I told you the dragons

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:37.039
are um not an order but they're actual people that's where we're you know

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:45.179
making content contact with the real right these are real people so

00:19:45.179 --> 00:19:50.400
um when we have bowls that breathe fire yeah and when we have

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:57.900
wolves that change their skin um you're talking about groups of people

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:04.500
yeah people who have certain magic abilities

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:10.440
yeah time to put the whether they're the singers or the or the singers that

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:18.240
change time yeah this is good this is good stuff so amen

00:20:18.419 --> 00:20:26.220
amen is a phrase that you need to get stuck in your head right I am the amen

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:31.860
when you see those people when you see those people stepping

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:40.080
forward into your temple and desecrating it right your loyalty is not to a political

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:48.780
party your loyalty is to that shrine it's to that which is the American

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:54.600
symbol um and I think people understand that

00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:01.020
very well you know the classical world was big on building monuments

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:07.980
building monuments and bringing that constant veneration of what was

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:14.700
beautiful forward right you don't desecrate those holy areas

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:20.520
because when you do you lose the benefit of that power

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:28.559
completely you lose the benefit of the Republic all right it's only when Tom says it's

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:36.480
only when the blood is shed on the roots of the tree of Liberty

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:43.980
right if you do not take care of your Insurrection it will happen repeatedly I

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:49.200
tell you as a student of Roman history

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:57.240
right when you allow the instant when you the interaction goes unpunished people end up you end up with more

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:03.200
you end up with more but what's Curious is these insurrections have to be fueled

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:09.600
by a combustible component something that's going to spark and set

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:18.179
things on fire I want you to watch again the very last the clock last clip that we showed and

00:22:18.179 --> 00:22:24.120
this is The Modern event this is the modern this is happening and

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:30.960
as this is happening the fire that is within again analog the

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:39.240
fire that is within that compound sparked and boom it'll go up and it

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:46.440
happens Time After Time After Time right very readily predictable predictable run

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:52.690
that clip again please [Music]

00:23:09.659 --> 00:23:11.900
foreign

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.799
[Music]

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.749
[Music]

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:43.399
[Music]

00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:02.100
Tom also said that the greatest threat to the

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:07.740
fledgling American democracy was the Presbyterians

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:14.179
um I'm sure it you know he had to be back then to really to us that wouldn't be really mean the same thing

00:24:14.179 --> 00:24:21.360
but this revival that is happening is a part of History it's a cycle and what

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:28.020
you're going to see is its effervescence it's going to grow it started and it's

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:35.039
going to grow to a point to a point that it spills over

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:40.799
and must bring the destruction of what

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:46.799
is contrary to it around it it breaks out it's a power that breaks

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:53.039
out um I just want to I want to quote to you just a little bit of lycophone to take

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:58.320
us now to the prophetic side and I'm going to pull out

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.840
who somebody called the chameleon civil

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:10.620
somebody called the chameleon symbol yeah and I want you to know that the

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:16.260
chameleon symbol talked about the dipsets

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:24.980
The Thirst that is induced and that she said

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:33.659
the darkness you may this may sound familiar the Sun would become darkened

00:25:33.659 --> 00:25:39.659
um the word is shaded full of the as if it's creeping up and pulling out its

00:25:39.659 --> 00:25:46.380
power that is from the chameleon Sybil via VIA

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:52.980
um like a fraud she also this the Within These

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:59.940
prophecies we have for example Athens right and we have the the the

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:06.360
um telling of the war um between Athens and Persia yeah

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:11.460
specifically Xerxes yeah and we have that preserved within

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:18.659
it so we have these ancient prophecies uh remember the early Christians were called sybilis for a reason

00:26:18.659 --> 00:26:25.740
right so we are we seeing a return of that yes we are saying a return of the

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:33.659
reactivation of the mystery yeah and um it's happening as we speak

00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:40.679
and will have an effect will have an effect so I want to say a

00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:48.539
quick appreciation I also brought some of the Candor that I wanted to talk about because he uses the you know go to the

00:26:48.539 --> 00:26:54.419
priests that use the terminology of the Mysteries and you can see what's really happening

00:26:54.419 --> 00:26:59.460
um fantastic um and again the Scott the modern day Scholars they're just like you ask them

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:06.240
about a mystery and they're like oh that's why the word mystery is there and next time they do you stop them and you

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:12.240
say look you cannot take me in the back alley today right you can't so that's

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:18.600
why I've I had that I had that priest waiting for you but I just want

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:25.760
to say it's been an outstanding an outstanding season and from the

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:31.799
productive nature of what you have been bringing forward and all of the groups

00:27:31.799 --> 00:27:38.580
that have been um active at the P you know the individuals

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:44.400
um very intelligent driven individuals who have stepped forward and who have

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:51.779
made this interaction um so worthwhile to me with your great

00:27:51.779 --> 00:27:57.240
feedback I'm looking at your Visions yeah I'm looking at your Visions for the

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:06.419
secretive group it's on the inside that nobody knows about right um yeah uh keep up the work keep up the

00:28:06.419 --> 00:28:13.260
work because we have to refuse to become this

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:19.100
right we're not going that way we're going reason and if the if the

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:26.640
proper resolution of that that we saw tonight

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.820
if the proper resolution is the antidote then shouldn't we be seeking the

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:38.940
antidote yeah definitely definitely it's been a privilege and an

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:45.720
honor to serve with you I will have one Bible study on Wednesday

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:53.039
and then I will take a week and recoup

00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:00.360
which means I will spend time pulling up the sources that I believe

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:06.480
would be most desired by you at that time right the

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:13.200
real I mean come on people you you don't need to keep coming back unless there's real good stuff unless I can pull out

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:21.600
the good stuff right I mean are you in there yeah I've got to pull out the good stuff

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:27.840
and I've got to bring that to you and um now that we have figured out how to

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:34.140
navigate this ship and how to be able to get into those positions where we can see what they're doing in Antiquity now

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:39.299
it's time to say hey we need to uh we need to dig in and we need to go the

00:29:39.299 --> 00:29:44.700
places that you know people are not gonna naturally be drawn to we gotta we gotta

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:50.520
go to those dark places and we've got to work with them um I have enjoyed myself tremendously

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:57.299
this this time guys thank you so much we've got a couple of people um looks like oh

00:29:57.299 --> 00:30:04.140
Snappy Snappy welcome Snappy we need introduction music for snapping Snappy

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:09.360
you you saw the you saw the people tonight gathered together

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.539
when I'm in that assembly and you saw them

00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:22.860
perform an action that can only be described as ecstatic right that was that was pure ecstasy whether they were

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:28.559
in the capital or whether they were in that church um tell me how does that make you feel

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:36.240
from your perspective and tell us you know were you there have you been in that you know how does it make you feel

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.700
um yeah it makes me disgusted to be honest because it's it's very clear that

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:48.120
these people have an agenda and uh anyone who's intimate or familiar with the church knows what that agenda is

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:54.360
it's agenda of genocide it's agenda of control and uh you saw how they were are

00:30:54.360 --> 00:31:01.440
they were raising their arms up they're they're drawing down that Spirit right of Christ they're becoming possessed

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.539
they're becoming frenzy they're trying to block out all

00:31:06.539 --> 00:31:12.120
reason all thought so that they can just focus on this Mission this Christian

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:17.940
National insanity and it blows my mind blows myself yeah yeah and you know if

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:25.260
you watch they've got a live feed they've got a live feed I highly recommend that people tune into the live

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:31.860
feed of what's going on in Kentucky right now um and uh what direction the people are

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:39.840
they have they sing of kingdom and they sing of power on Earth and they sing of

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:45.740
with trumpets they have their horns on bird and they're blowing their horns

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:51.059
they're getting it you can feel the Ecstasy moving up and people come up and

00:31:51.059 --> 00:31:56.820
they prostrate themselves and they enter that place right I mean we could put

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:03.779
their pictures up on Ancient walls and it wouldn't change you know it wouldn't be any different

00:32:03.779 --> 00:32:09.620
um how does it do you think that this is a um um

00:32:09.779 --> 00:32:16.200
some sort of Awakening um what is this what is this thing

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:21.240
they're doing this is a this is a panic this is what

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:28.320
happens when things are in their death throws they're recognizing that the culture is moving on and they're lashing

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:34.440
out and they're lashing out with everything they have so that they can reassert their dominance this is Kronos

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:40.640
devouring his children in paranoia that's what we're seeing here

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:47.340
oh I like that that's why excuse me I like that that's why yeah that's why oh

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:52.740
God I love the image it's like the struggling they're in the they know that

00:32:52.740 --> 00:33:00.539
their downfall is imminent right because they can't they did this in the first century as well right and people say no

00:33:00.539 --> 00:33:06.360
it wasn't Nero right I mean it wasn't the Christians that Nero was saying the government was saying it's the

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:11.399
Christians that burned burned the city down and the Christians were saying no

00:33:11.399 --> 00:33:18.120
it was Nero right why because I don't think Nero was out setting fires Scholars debate this and I'm like why

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:24.000
are you debating something that is so patently stupid right of course Nero

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.899
wasn't out setting fires and burning his own City down right this is the conflagration it always comes it's a

00:33:30.899 --> 00:33:36.960
cleansing right the frenzy is is maxed out and I mean did anybody see the guy

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:44.279
was wearing horns who's in the I mean you can't get you can't get more ecstatic right in the name of Jesus

00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:51.019
right amen amen

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:59.820
Snappy tell me is it alarm is it uh being too much of an alarmist uh or are

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:06.659
we accurately predicting a future that we're we're on our way to another Insurrection right it's not going to

00:34:06.659 --> 00:34:13.200
stop because no it's not going to stop it's not stopping because right like I'm not an American but it's happening here

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:19.800
in my country too in Canada we're seeing the same kind of extremification you're seeing the same kind of vilification of

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:26.580
gender minorities look at what's going on with Putin like you showed in the episode on Wednesday right Putin is

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:32.940
making this uh this change and he's making the new young people the enemy

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:38.099
he's he's coming at us with everything he has to try and assert that Christian

00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:43.618
National control right because they're on the way out that whole methodology

00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:50.220
that whole way of thinking it's dead it's old it's tired and it's stagnant it's it's time for it to go right we

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:56.700
gotta castrate them yeah what do people think the people I wonder maybe we can take a poll of the

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:03.960
chat but um did people think that that Beast is dead or dying we'll say die at least

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:09.780
dying or is this Resurgence of their power I mean look they got to 30 they

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:16.440
got to 30 percent and all the historians would tell you you get a third of the population support you do anything you

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:22.200
can pull down your Republic with just 30 percent report well support right so

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:27.839
they achieved critical mass they achieved critical mass and here they go

00:35:27.839 --> 00:35:35.940
um it may be a while before somebody goes into Canadian holy

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:42.660
space and desecrates it but do you see that coming oh yeah so I used to live in

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:49.260
the capital city of Ottawa and I would have to walk by the parliament every single day and there are people who have

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:56.280
been posted out there 24 7 with massive signs saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Trudeau and the word

00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:02.280
the world is ending and like we're gonna we need to bring God back into Parliament and they scream and assaulted

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:08.640
people who are just walking around wearing masks they blare terrible Christian music it's like I've never

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:15.300
seen this kind of level of antagonism here in Canada people don't act like this here you know we're far more

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.640
controlled about it but not anymore there's like this rampant fervent

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:27.420
insanity and like for the first time in a long time we're starting to see people who identify like this like we have a

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:33.540
far right uh leader named Pierre pauliev who uses a lot of that language you know

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:40.800
he doesn't come out and say it but it's it's this polite way of talking to those extremists he is a Christian nationalist

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:47.940
by any other word if you really listen you know and that's how these people are they're manipulative and they're all

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:53.040
about power they do anything you know to get what do you think do you think that

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:59.099
do you think you guys or getting that on your own or

00:36:59.099 --> 00:37:06.060
should I call should America call its doctor and find out you know maybe do you think we infected

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:12.000
you or it's because it's always been it's it's a combination because we

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:19.500
always we're so interconnected To America that whatever happens in America we have a mirroring effect here but I

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:25.680
also can't Kid myself this kind of extreme conservatism and this nationalism and Christian stuff has

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:32.700
existed in many different forms in many different ways since the since the colonial age so it's it's an intrinsic

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:37.859
part of Canada as well yeah that's why I always laugh when I read uh Jefferson

00:37:37.859 --> 00:37:43.079
all scared about the Presbyterians right he's like no they're the biggest threat

00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:50.040
right now right so it makes me wonder if it's a what is it is it something in

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:56.099
within the system the program is running and it runs throughout centuries but

00:37:56.099 --> 00:38:03.900
it's got a consistent um it's got a consistent code in it that tells you abort and terminate right and

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:10.200
then all of the all of the it doesn't scare people that it's kind of zombie-like I mean you know what I mean

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:17.220
it's a little bit zombie-like isn't it um is it you know uh how okay

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:22.619
question how how does it stop how do you stop something like this if you're a

00:38:22.619 --> 00:38:30.000
Roman in the first century right the answer is a Crackdown a government Crackdown right where you don't you you

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.780
don't worship if you're going to tear stuff up we're not going to allow you to worship you know get out of here kind of

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:44.339
kind of thing and you you crucify some of them and show people this is what happens when you do this right you you

00:38:44.339 --> 00:38:50.880
can't we also see the end outcome in Rome with that kind of thinking right that extreme

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:58.260
kind of thinking that led to crusade to get led to Crusades against itself that's what fundamentally destroys Rome

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.420
right when the Catholics and the Orthodox divide over ridiculous

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:09.480
Linguistics and philosophy you know and that's what we're going to see with

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:14.579
the with the with what's what's happening in America even you know if these if they succeed in their mission

00:39:14.579 --> 00:39:19.980
they're just going to destroy themselves it's inevitable right we're seeing this hollowing out that's what's so

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:26.579
ridiculous right now is that America is attacking itself you've always seen that Machinery go out into the world and

00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:32.339
consume but now it's turned inward that's that's the death Rose well and

00:39:32.339 --> 00:39:40.920
that's yeah I I think that's why Tom is so angry because he said it happens every 100 to 150 years right that it's

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:48.180
cyclical so um you know here we are after the Civil War we're right at that Mark where yeah

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:53.400
this kind of thing is gonna happen and what do we do are we unionists I mean

00:39:53.400 --> 00:40:00.720
I'm sure you got the same thing in Canada same decision they're gonna have to figure out a reunion is yeah you need

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:08.339
to uh what you need to do is Revitalize we need to embrace change we need to take on that new dionysian energy we

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:15.960
need to get rid of the old stagnant and be reborn again in in a vitality and then

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:22.160
have the cycle replay right like we need to bring her back right

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:27.780
it's me it makes me know that you know efforts in building

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:32.880
um the Tower of Babel are progressing because that's really what you need you

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:42.060
need some kind of universal communication for the people to be able to respond to

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:49.380
this cataclysmic effervescent you know they're screaming in the video of the of

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:54.780
the Insurrection they're screaming open Revolution right they're screaming it

00:40:54.780 --> 00:41:00.839
they've 1776 here we go you know they're uh uh

00:41:00.839 --> 00:41:07.380
um and but what else do we need to pay attention to there what it's this extreme magical thinking too because

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:14.040
when you listen to them it shows their ignorance like they're talking about saving America and it's like they're

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:20.359
pissing all over the Constitution even me is not an American knows them bringing God into this and talking about

00:41:20.359 --> 00:41:25.859
turning it into a Christian anything is it's totally anathema to everything the

00:41:25.859 --> 00:41:33.780
America stands for is it doesn't make sense is Canada gonna stand with America

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:42.000
as we go through this or I mean there's no reason that it couldn't hit both of us and you guys end up having a your

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.140
your form of a civil war right I mean it's been uh uh 150 years for us maybe

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:55.560
you maybe you're in for a natural one as well and this kind of global you know it

00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:01.020
only makes sense dude we're all over the planet now right so one country goes

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:06.119
through this this ecstasy and starts marching out

00:42:06.119 --> 00:42:13.079
people um of whatever gender or belief that they want and and killing him or

00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:21.000
torturing them or stuff like that and we've already seen it parallel exactly happen along the same lines in Brazil it

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:28.320
was the same people following the Q Anon cult they even tried it on the same day January 6. too much the same results

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:33.540
where the the military and the police came in and just surrounded and arrested

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:40.020
everyone but they still attempted it they still walked into their holiest sites and desecrated them in the name of

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:47.640
God and the same insanity and like yeah I think right now we have Trudeau who is

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:53.220
a phony liberal Centrist who just says what everyone wants to hear but what we're seeing in Canada is this extreme

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:58.380
fervor that I have never witnessed I have never seen people hate someone so

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:05.520
much and that is dangerous I don't know what comes next but yeah we're not in a

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:11.099
much better place yeah see that's what that's what I that's why I wanted to have a

00:43:11.099 --> 00:43:16.380
conversation from the beginning right where are we right what can we

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:22.560
rationally say that we're at a point where there's going to be some sort of tipping over

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:29.940
and you know the secessionists here in the states are going to be loud enough and do something extreme enough to set

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:37.140
off that natural Kindle out there and they'll they're all saying they want to right and the racists want to do it for

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:42.240
the obvious reason right they just want the murder and the Mayhem but

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:48.660
um the evangelicals are doing it because guess what same motive right they have a

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:55.020
plan for the end times and America's not there if you listen to any of these

00:43:55.020 --> 00:44:00.599
preachers you were in the church you know I'm I'm not tell me if I'm saying truth or not

00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:07.140
Snappy um but they're saying uh there's no America they're prophets they're people

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:14.280
who are analyzing the profits they're all saying there is no America no right America has always equated even usually

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:20.280
with some kind of phony apocal like they're gonna Burn Right America is the

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:26.339
is is going to be it everything has to be destroyed right you

00:44:26.339 --> 00:44:32.160
have to have the Messiah arise in Israel you know this is the thing America is

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.500
always going to be corrupt for this is always an intense thing among a lot of people in the church that I went to is

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:44.880
whether or not you even participated in politics because politics was so corrupted and was the tool of Satan but

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:52.200
most people did because they wanted to enforce their judgmental agenda and others you know all right and that's

00:44:52.200 --> 00:45:00.720
exactly what Celsius are you Celsius says the Christians are putting the devil to use in that way just as a foil

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:10.319
just as a foil if we have this huge eruption of this ecstatic Christianity that's

00:45:10.319 --> 00:45:15.780
able to spill over and overthrow governments overthrow entire governments

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:22.800
it fulfills the Evangelical understanding of Prophecy that the

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:28.079
United States is not is not in the

00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:35.700
apocalypse that they have already been taken out and what's funny is the guy that has to exist then and you just get

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:42.900
this off of just go listen to some preachers right the guy that that has to be there then is the Great Bear and

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:50.460
everybody says we know who the great bearers who will come down to Gog and mega it's Vlad Putin right so the

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:56.240
Christians are constructing their own reality around them and

00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:03.180
ecstatically and we don't even perceive of this until they get into the capital

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:10.280
and take a dump and some senators get um realized uh-oh people could have died

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:15.960
right uh and then we're in the spot that we're in so I'm sorry to hear that you

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:23.160
haven't had your your um over spillage yet because it makes me feel like maybe

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:31.200
it was something that originated here maybe it's uh we did have mass protests so like in my

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:36.359
in my home City we had Ottawa we had over a month and a half of

00:46:36.359 --> 00:46:42.359
a trucker protest where they blocked the entire downtown core they occupied the

00:46:42.359 --> 00:46:47.640
city which is the capital city they didn't they couldn't make it to Parliament and but they like wouldn't

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:55.560
stop blaring their horns they were defecating in the streets people were waving Confederate flags in Canada

00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:01.380
people were wearing wait wait wait wait wait wait wait let me see I where wait I

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:07.579
had her yeah I had seen a report on that I had did not know that they were waving

00:47:07.579 --> 00:47:13.380
American Confederate flags yeah there was at least one that was documented for

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:19.500
sure and that person repented and said well I just thought the flag meant freedom and I'm a

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:26.099
Libertarian whatever we all know but there was also Nazi flags and there was

00:47:26.099 --> 00:47:32.220
also stars of David that said savac which means like no vaccines because

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:37.260
they were envisioning themselves as the Jews being persecuted by the government

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:44.579
because the government was saying they had to get at least one mandatory vaccine wait a minute wait a minute so

00:47:44.579 --> 00:47:51.900
in Canada then the extreme religious uh Jews

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:57.599
and Christians you call them evangelicals yeah these people weren't Jewish these

00:47:57.599 --> 00:48:04.920
were all Evangelical all crazy people they were just adopting Jewish symbolism hitlerian symbolism to show how

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:10.619
persecuted they are they have this ridiculous persecution complex about how

00:48:10.619 --> 00:48:17.460
masks and social distancing and all of this stuff is some kind of insane oppression and how they need to

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:22.560
overthrow the government and like like literally I worked downtown at a at a

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:29.040
like an occult kind of shop in the byword market during the summer and I would watch them walk into the byword

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:34.800
market which is like an open-air like Pavilion and they'd just be like shouting about how Christ is going to

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:42.420
come and destroy the Canadian government and and like how masks were the first beginning of this brand like they're

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:48.119
oppressed because they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] masks I couldn't believe it like people guess what they're in Ukraine you're bitching

00:48:48.119 --> 00:48:54.900
about masks guess what they did to the Romans too right Rome must Burn Right

00:48:54.900 --> 00:49:00.300
became the it was the Grand enemy of everything that was there that wasn't

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:06.660
their theocracy right so yeah wow what do you project is the

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:14.160
what do you project is the future here what I mean let's let's try to intelligently figure this out what's the

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:20.280
next stage dude it's there has there's going to be some

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:25.440
kind of overthrowing right like this is cyclical you see this time and time and

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:32.400
time again across history across everything it may not have to be extreme violence but it's going to have to be an

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:39.660
actual transformation there has to be a change where these people get removed that they're no longer in the power that

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:46.200
they have otherwise like I don't I don't know like I see an apocalypse moment on our hands here and when I see apocalypse

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:52.859
it's like it's either a rebirth or destruction you know it could go either way and like these people that were

00:49:52.859 --> 00:49:58.619
fighting up against they're again they're they're for stagnation they're destroying and they're desecrating

00:49:58.619 --> 00:50:04.800
nature the mother you know with everything they have and they're telling us to keep our heads in the sand will

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.960
they continue to rape her until we all die that's that's what we're facing here

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:16.140
yeah what about these mobs I'll I'll ask this question what about these mobs of

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:22.859
they're like flash mobs of um evangelicals

00:50:22.859 --> 00:50:29.060
um I mean it's not strictly just evangelicals it's it's um

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:34.920
people who were people who are filled with the spirit who are having this kind

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:42.180
of revivals there'll be bands that go to parks and set up and they'll just get a flash mob and it becomes an event it

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:49.079
becomes an event where people come and they enter into the Ecstasy what do you do the Romans said you got to stop this

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:54.480
and they went in and broke it up and said you can't meet like this right you can't meet

00:50:54.480 --> 00:51:02.579
so and they tagged Everybody by the drugs they were using right that was the thing for them what um how do you stop

00:51:02.579 --> 00:51:08.040
these flash mobs that they haven't turned violent yet

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:14.040
they haven't turned violent yet right so you know well I would say I

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:20.940
would I would push back slightly on that because they have turned violent um in some in some respects we've seen

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:26.720
mass shootings targeting LGBT events and you see a lot of these people Target

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:32.880
specifically drag shows or um drag Story Time and usually you'll have specific

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:39.660
antagonistic forces that are present like the proud boys you know with their iconography and their you know no

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:47.220
fapping and their extreme aggression and you know they're they're out to Target certain kinds of video individuals and

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:52.980
as as pedophiles you know like and they're waiting their weight they're

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:59.880
waiting for this thing called the storm and they're so well armed yeah boys

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:04.920
right those guys with the guns who are actually trying to and like they pretend

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:11.160
to be on other people's side so that they can infiltrate and start a revolution and if you pay attention to

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:17.520
these darker places on the Internet it's it's all very clear like all these people you know what it is is that when

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:23.760
people experience extreme isolation extreme Division and oppression and we

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:30.540
all see the bleakness it brings out the Mania brings up the craziness people react in all kinds of different ways you

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:37.319
know and a lot of these people they get caught up in these Christian National frenzy and it spills out in a variety of

00:52:37.319 --> 00:52:42.540
ways it's it's not all unified you know it's it's wild

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:47.640
so what's the if we're entering this apocalypse then which I think it's fair

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:54.119
to say if we have um violence at this level right and you talk about I shouldn't have I didn't

00:52:54.119 --> 00:53:01.380
dismiss it but I didn't even consider it yeah we've got shootings all the time that are you know motivated by this same

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:07.260
core right this very well-armed contingent these are now

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:15.900
um enemies domestic and they'll throw that around right um as if it's funny that yeah right

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:22.940
um yeah waving a Confederate flag with a Confederate flag and defecating

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:29.520
defecating on our monuments what a mouse is this is this the perfect apocalypse

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:34.920
or what I mean we can have a natural Extinction event here you know what I

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:40.859
mean if we're if we don't snap out of it don't you think I think that's that's

00:53:40.859 --> 00:53:49.200
what I'm getting at if we don't wake up and recognize what we're doing to to to Nature to our home to our mother

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:56.579
what future is there right like you know like there's none without her

00:53:56.579 --> 00:54:02.160
and they they just they're just they they insist on destruction

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:08.040
yeah who were they praying to in the U.S Capitol they were praying to him they

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:13.380
were praying to a he God who doesn't have a problem with certain things like

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:18.660
you know killing people that aren't righteous and aren't part of the plan

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:27.240
right I mean these people argue look at the history of these people these people argue about who is the most Orthodox and

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:34.859
why that Clan ought to be taken out I was always told about the 100 and I

00:54:34.859 --> 00:54:42.540
think it's like 37 000 or something right the chosen people who will get to rule over everyone for all eternity in

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:49.020
Homeland the world to come right after the apocalypse when the world is reborn and you're living in this Celestial

00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:54.740
theocracy for all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time it's a nightmare it's an absolute nightmare

00:54:54.740 --> 00:55:00.119
that's why I think one of the I think the only solution is that Tower of Babel

00:55:00.119 --> 00:55:07.140
if if if Christians knew if Christians knew that their own Master their own

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:12.240
founder their own God the Son of God was

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:19.500
um arrested in a public park with a naked boy and called himself a child trafficker and was part of a cult that

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:25.380
involves sexual relations with children um I would uh

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:30.720
um I don't know is that is there any way of snapping this you know sometimes

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:39.240
sometimes stuff will burn itself out by using it's it's all its oxygen up right and then it's gone the fire goes away is

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:46.020
there is there some place of Reason Snappy that we could bring these people to that we could show them and

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:52.980
reasonably say look you know it's not your fault that you've been worshiping a pedophile criminal this is this is an

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:58.079
important thing because honestly I think it's a it's a two-pronged thing number

00:55:58.079 --> 00:56:05.520
one there has to be like you said reason and truth and honesty there has to be a revealing anyone who breaks free of

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:11.700
these kind of Cults has it does so by being shown what it really is for what

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:18.839
it is number one but number two there has to be a healing there has to be an integration and an acceptance you can't

00:56:18.839 --> 00:56:26.280
just exclude people you have to if people are willing to go through that transformation that death to to abandon

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:31.800
those attachments those views we have to accept them we have to let people heal

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:37.380
and if you don't that's when you you extremify now you've not given people a

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:42.540
way out now they're they're going you're you're bound to fight each other you

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:48.900
know we can't allow that no I don't yeah it's uh

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:53.940
it's a global event you know the evangelicals love this because it'll

00:56:53.940 --> 00:57:00.240
feed their flames right because come on man that's all I'm doing is feeding the flames right it's very easy to get these

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:05.400
people going right because they want to bring the Fulfillment of their own plan

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:11.540
they want to bring it and what are they always yelling about what did the guy yell about from the U.S Capitol

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:17.520
globalists globalist globalist coming from this old American dominionist

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:23.940
theology a theology anchored in an eschatology

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:31.740
that was punctuated by revivals right so of course they're fearing the

00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:39.000
globalists the globalists are those who would come in but that what they don't realize is and they

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:46.140
always do this preemptively right it's like they're it's like a political party that will that will throw something out

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:51.839
that they're doing in order to like create a smoke screen right so you can't accuse them because they're already

00:57:51.839 --> 00:57:57.960
accusing the other leader of doing this doing the same thing um the globalists out there they're

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:03.660
doing this with this globalist idea when at the same time the problem is global

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:11.280
look what's sweeping across Russia into Georgia and all of the uh all of the

00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:16.740
fervor I mean did you see Putin's speech it was all about his gaining the

00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:22.339
religious High Ground right God hate God hates these people

00:58:22.339 --> 00:58:28.980
the argument for me it's always important to look at what these people hate and what they

00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:34.440
fear okay why would they be opposed to globalism right why why are both Putin

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:40.799
and Trump yelling about that why because that way they get to maintain their fiefdoms right they get to maintain

00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:48.900
their hegemony but their hegemonys are dying they're old they're falling apart we have to move on we have to let this

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:54.240
stuff go and and be reborn to something greater right like

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:59.460
it's in it's we're we're in a state of absolute Insanity at this moment

00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:04.859
um like someone like Putin like he everyone in the world is telling him the writing is on the walls you have to

00:59:04.859 --> 00:59:11.760
diversify you can't stay with all of this raw resources you have to try and incorporate and his whole thing is what

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:17.819
no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the entire world you guys are the the enemy and then I'm creating this

00:59:17.819 --> 00:59:22.859
whole Third Rome and it's a war right you guys are trying to destroy God and

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:28.980
we have to protect the masculine Jesus and the masculine God like we all saw that

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:34.140
and what's funny is to never consider but they never consider that Jesus was

00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:39.780
people complained about them came to disciples and complained about them and said he's touching the kids

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:44.819
inappropriately tell him to stop right none of that all that stuff just

00:59:44.819 --> 00:59:49.980
leaks through history until you get down to a modern Westerner holding up a sign

00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:56.339
that says Jesus saves pro-life right then you realize oh my God look at

00:59:56.339 --> 01:00:04.380
what's happened just through the flow of History what's happened with this incredible Mania that's come along Mania

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:47.770
