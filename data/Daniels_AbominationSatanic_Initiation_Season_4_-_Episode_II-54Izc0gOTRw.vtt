our eunuch where's our unit bring them up bring him that eunuchs get us up here

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.639
yep there we go oh here's so nice look at this where are we we're in the Book

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:42.780
of Daniel right which many of you think was written Hebrew but it's not the oldest version we have is in Greek and

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.120
it is not a translation it is not a magical let me step back

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.819
fairy tales aside everybody around you thinks that This

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:59.280
Book of Daniel was written in Hebrew and then translated maybe Aramaic translated

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:06.360
into Greek and Septuagint magically by 70 some Scholars and they weren't even

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:13.319
Scholars right they were holy men because who else could go into different cells and come up with the

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:18.419
exact same verbatim translation of a text that in Hebrew they said they have

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:25.860
but we don't have doesn't exist stop the magic let's get the science

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:32.639
going people and stop the magic Africanus was right stuff was written in Greek it's got Greek uh idiom minute

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:38.400
okay so let's look at it and funny thing is I'll give you one

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.720
one thing it will make the evangelicals quite upset all the references to Christ have been

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:51.960
scrubbed from it yes all the references of Christ in the Septuagint were taken

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.300
out by the gents gentlemen and I'll put my

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:03.479
focus on the men the gentlemen of the 10th century those

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:09.479
what do they call themselves they were a sect they were sacked trying to they had

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:17.039
one agenda and that was to make Hebrew the holy language right it's got to be the language of Jehovah that is the holy

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:24.560
language and these maserates they went ahead and they created a text in which they scrubbed any references to Christ

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:31.440
wow fantastic fan did you know that no but we have the original taxi they

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.919
couldn't they couldn't erase it from history because the Septuagint is still sitting there it's still there let's go

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:44.880
to the text run to the eunuchs remember we're in the garden with Jesus all the time that is all this investigation is

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.760
about to find out what he's doing in that garden with that naked kid

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:57.300
let's go to our first passes this is Daniel who is this now we're talking about Darius who's the king of the medes

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:03.800
huh that's what the text says King of the maids the bed door right okay

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:11.060
and the King says to his arch eunuch his

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:18.920
oh my God take that down what is it first of all I didn't know there was yeah it's much less Arch eunuchs yes

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:24.180
Arch Unix eunuchs are ranked Unix is ranked

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:30.959
what is a eunuch you say I just want to repeat

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:38.040
to you a little something that guazo said in the 16th yay yay here it is what

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:44.580
what what a laughable and at the same time pitiable example of this art is told of

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:50.820
a young man of narbone who was led into slavery by a thracian pirate

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:58.200
he was put to sleep by a powerful drug and his testicles were so neatly cut out that when he awoke thus deprived of his

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:05.640
Realty he marveled at himself as at a new man

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.459
yes a new creation gorgeous what do you do with Unix and antiquity

00:10:11.459 --> 00:10:18.959
there's a lot you can and can't do with Unix you can't get pregnant from them

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:24.180
yes you can't they no longer can impregnate you however they still have

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:29.700
sexual drive so they make excellent excellent excellent slaves for the

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:34.980
wealthy for the wealthy yes you can have if you're a woman you can have multiple

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.080

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.019
sake of the kingdom of uranos

think Chaldean people and you think oh he's talking about one thing there right the language yeah no he didn't mention a

00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:04.579
language but he also mentioned the gramata and for any bonehead who is Red which is excludes most classes is the

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:12.720
PGM you know straight up that these gramata are magical symbols

hmm magical symbols the gramata orfica right those magic symbols that

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:28.040
are being used vicious trying to figure out right we have our best man on it don't worry

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:36.420
that's what they're going to be learning yeah and they're going to do it through this closeness okay let's see what

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:42.240
happens then we go to Daniel we're gonna go to one of these eunuchs we're going to see what happens to them yeah go

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:49.740

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:10.260
Gabriel do he grabs him he grabs them right at the time of the Hesperides

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:16.020
right at the time of that evening sacrifice yeah and what does it say in

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:22.380
22. soon now they typically translate this as he taught or instructed or

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:28.260
something like that right he became one with baby he became one with me

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:33.320
yeah and he spoke with me and said

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:48.240

that place where you envision the god that is where the Abomination is it is

00:32:00.659 --> 00:32:07.200
that place where you envision the god via the drug it'll be established

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:16.559
it'll be established as the proper form an older form of worship in the Heron in

00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:21.960
the temple as the proper form of worship what does

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:29.039
that have to do with intercourse you being too dirty with Jesus and his boy

00:32:29.039 --> 00:32:34.679
and this thing about the Abominations what is that let's look let's look

00:32:34.679 --> 00:32:41.700
kitties let's look go ahead Martin

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:54.480
she lady Babylon has a golden cup in her hand and what is in that cup the

00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:04.940

intercourse of her Temple worship and right and on her forehead is a name

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.760
and what is that name

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:26.899
she is the mother of pornon the mother of those

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.419
prostitutive Acts yes

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:43.980

00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:59.220
that is full of her Abominations of her sex act

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:05.580
now you think you wander to yourself the re-establishment of this right

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:11.760
is the end of everything re-establishment of this right is the

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:18.118
end of everything interesting what incredible fear what

00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:26.040
incredible fear they had of this apparently enigmatic and amazing mystery

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:31.320
performance yes yes and now you know now

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:37.080
you know why we have to get there with Daniel if you want to have Vision you've

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:42.960
got to go through that eunuch that good looking eunuch right and you have to

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:49.858
bring that eunuch to the place to the place of the eremon to the air

00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:55.560
Moses you've got to bring him there and when he's in that place he'll have

00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:01.220
vision and that is what runs Empires right

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:06.420
these potentates whether they're masculine feminine ladies don't get all

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:12.060
don't get all you know self-righteous because you're the ones who figure this

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:17.760
stuff all out yeah it's all from feminine medicine fingerprints are all over it it's all

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:23.339
female medicine this is your art these Sorcerers are your sorcerers

00:35:23.339 --> 00:35:30.200
so does it make sense that you ladies would want to possess

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:36.660
castrated boys who can create vision

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:42.560
yeah yeah castrated boys who can create Vision you didn't think the great mother

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:48.300
phrygian mother you didn't think she cut off Addison's testicles for no reason did you

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:55.520
right um this is artisanry this is craftsmanship

00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.720
this is brilliant what they're doing to the human body is

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:07.980
fantastic and the texts the texts reflect the level of technical

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:14.940
skill level of technical skill that is certainly Beyond

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:21.599
um I don't believe we would have an ability in the modern world to reproduce these rights properly

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:29.400
I don't believe we'd be able to simply just based on the pharmacology just based on the pharmacology right

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:37.320
what a world it would be to open the Water of Life right and to increase our age

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:43.680
and to create to create the Medusa again

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:49.440
and to bring that transition why is a world that we hunger for that

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:55.740
transition to the bock that transition from the masculine to the feminine turn

00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:03.500
me into a woman what does that mean what does it mean when a man cries

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:14.339
that's the Hallelujah before the Hallelujah and it was a Hallelujah yelled by somebody who's being

00:37:14.339 --> 00:37:20.160
transformed from a male into a female

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:27.480

number two those victorians or nastiness yes you can see them their

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:32.339
faces would crack if they um if you force them to show you the

00:39:32.339 --> 00:39:37.800
filth that comes from the great Harlot yes I think that would kill every

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:43.680
British Victorian scholar of Classics who ever lived I think it would I think

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:50.820
it I think the very thought of it would kill we wouldn't have to even bring it in and show them they just kill them yes

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:56.520
just thinking about it next one please yep that's good oh well here um yeah

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:03.240
here's our Abomination right as of an idol notice they've got to throw that in which is hilarious okay keep going

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:08.579
because performing idolatry and having sex is the same word anyway anywho

00:40:08.579 --> 00:40:15.000
hot and they dated yes this is Jesus now right this is our this is our guy who

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.400
knows about the ejections of the great Harlot right and he knows about castrating children

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:28.380
and people are yelling at him for getting touchy of the eremos

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:36.480
this abomination of entering the

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:43.920
singular solitary nudity have you ever been in edemosis

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:50.400
have you ever been you know an angel can show you that an angel can take you there

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:56.579
it's a place where you get vision it's a place where you get Vision so now

00:40:56.579 --> 00:41:01.680
you're starting to think look everybody's been here a while this is satanic initiation everybody's been here

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:07.980
for a while and we've all you know been wondering where this thing is going and we're beginning

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:14.400
to see this kind of ship emerge through the fog we're seeing

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:21.119
the ship emerge the fog and we're beginning to think I could ride in that ship I could become a member of that I

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:28.020
could jump onto it I could sail off in the fog and that ship that is what the mystery is right something performed

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:36.780
mystery is not faith Paul shut up never confuses the two never

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:43.920
you can't mystery is not faith and that's why everybody here who believes

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:50.040
the fairy tale will immediately be caught unawares

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:55.680
because the faith is not the operation of your mystery the faith is not the

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:03.839
operation of your mystery yeah yeah that faith is proof it's a seal

00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:11.760
it's a proof that you engage it's not the actual performance of

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:17.400
and this is a problem Paul shut up he's trying to make this conversion

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.500
right trying to do it it's a form of indoctrination and it's it's very

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:28.560
unflattering by the way people say Paul is the greatest writer in the New Testament he's so smart bull bull

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:34.980
bull yeah yeah this is just common yeah there's nothing impressive about it you

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:40.380
see a lot more impressive from Hardcore pagans so don't don't think that Paul is

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:46.440
Mr Smarty smart right he may be taking his drugs full of that Viper Venom so

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:52.200
he's immune right but we're not here to bash you shut up and sit down

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:58.440
I oh he's so loud go bring us up next text look at this people the aces what

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:04.280
is that um I just want you to notice that it is paired here with orexas below

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:09.839
epithemia these are the drives these are the drives so that angel is dealing with

00:43:09.839 --> 00:43:15.200
Daniel with Daniel at the level of the drives right or axis

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:22.440
conconation a longing for something this comes from Kono kanari and Latin to want

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:30.200
um I am taking I am Desiring I am wanting good how about this what is this

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:36.780
this is what they want this is what that tsunetes is Daniel and

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:42.900
the angel have a have a relationship that is that of the Sun tairas

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:49.200
the hatira well Tyra they used to translate as

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:55.079
um mistress [Music] hatara is your mistress so

00:43:55.079 --> 00:44:02.099
it's using the same root to indicate the relationship is that is

00:44:02.099 --> 00:44:08.880
one of lovers yeah and don't be surprised you saw Hercules with his boy everywhere he's

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:16.020
leading around you saw Jesus with his little boy and he's got in the garden right you've seen this with the little

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:22.920
boys this just shouldn't shouldn't Amaze you the thing that you haven't seen is the women with the little boys

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:30.660
right so we've got nothing to balance it we've got nothing to balance hence the necessity of the transformation

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:36.060
yeah this is gorgeous I love this stuff okay last I think I have one more

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:42.240
um one no not that one put up that one yep nope that was it okay

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:50.520
so uh when we look at the big picture of the activation of the mystery

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:56.460
and we're looking at the actual practice of the mystery where we need to start

00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:02.160
forming a vocabulary around it so that when somebody says abomination of

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:07.920
desolation um that means something right now to you sitting there Abomination desolation

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:13.740
doesn't mean anything that phrase doesn't mean you can hear preachers throw that thing around none

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:20.099
of them knows what it means none of them if they knew it would make them even

00:45:20.099 --> 00:45:25.260
more faithful right but they follow the fairy tale

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:30.480
they follow the fairy tale so they can't grasp right it's the same thing that

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:37.740
drove the classics department at the University of Wisconsin to say the Romans just wouldn't do such a thing

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:45.960
and talking about drugs the Romans just wouldn't do such a thing right totally how could you not of all

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:51.180
the drugs that we've brought before us of all the drugs that you've seen

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:56.819
now you know there's you could never make that statement you know more than a

00:45:56.819 --> 00:46:03.060
classicist who is a professor that not is just a professor she was the head of my department

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:10.200
she was the head of the department yes Saint Andrews educated

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:16.380
yes and she didn't know she didn't know she had never seen you mean and all you're

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:21.599
done and all your time of reading The Iliad you never saw that they were using

00:46:21.599 --> 00:46:27.660
drugs did all did we all miss the eunuch you know I was talking to the devil I was

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:32.599
talking to devil asking him

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:42.119
you're not even gonna see the eunuch he says you didn't even see the eunuch oh my God how did we miss these people

00:46:42.119 --> 00:46:47.880
how do we miss these things where is all of this going you don't know this world

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:53.640
and people will sit up in front of you and will tell you they will tell you this is how it is

00:46:53.640 --> 00:47:01.619
experts abomination of desolation abomination

00:47:01.619 --> 00:47:09.119
I defy you to tell me what that is based upon what preachers priests and holy

00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:16.380
people say New Testament Scholars they suck too yeah yeah

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:22.800
what are these off-runnings what are these offerings what are these things that are vomited forth these

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:30.960
unclean things that she brings up in her cup from her poor nail from her poor nail your history was

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:36.900
built upon this right and Daniel is a part of

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:43.800
it through the medes through the medes you

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:48.839
cannot enter that Kingdom

00:47:48.839 --> 00:47:54.319
without cutting off your own testicles

00:47:54.319 --> 00:48:00.839
wow that's something okay okay I'm more circumspect now

00:48:00.839 --> 00:48:06.599
we've got to in the future from now on we're going to start mounting our case

00:48:06.599 --> 00:48:14.339
because we've got the indictment is going to come down we know that the trans-dimensional grand

00:48:14.339 --> 00:48:20.420
jury found that Jesus's crimes are to be

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:25.859
prosecuted so we're ready to go we're ready to go they voted to prosecute so

00:48:25.859 --> 00:48:33.119
we have to be building a case now and in order to do that we're gonna have to take back these texts I gave you tonight

00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:41.060
as you're sitting here and I respect your time all of you who are listening got tremendous respect

00:48:41.099 --> 00:48:47.400
and I don't want to waste your time so I'm just gonna say it like it is we

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:53.660
need to kick down the door of the Temple and we need to take back these texts

00:48:53.660 --> 00:49:02.460
these are ours that one that I read to you tonight that was buried that was buried by a

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:09.480
religious sect in the 10th and 11th centuries ninth ninth and 10th and 11th centuries

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:17.640
who buried this text they did not want you understanding what was going on now

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:23.940
maybe they did it from their own ignorance right and you know you can't make a back translation without screwing

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:30.720
things up right it just doesn't work and in fact they tried to do what the Babylonians did with the tower it tries

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:38.819
to do it backwards route it through Hebrew and it didn't work historically Chronos Saturn says Nah Nah don't worry

00:49:38.819 --> 00:49:45.780
don't work that way we're bound to time we're bound to time and before Jehovah

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:52.980
was this mystery now stop I just said the mystery produced

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:59.760
everything do you remember in the garden do you remember what we do

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:07.460
we have our eyes opened and we end up stripped naked

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:14.750
welcome to the right and hail Satan drinking whiskey

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:21.140
