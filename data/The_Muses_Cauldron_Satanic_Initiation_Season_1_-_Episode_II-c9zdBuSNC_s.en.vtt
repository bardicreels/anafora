sort of cash or reimbursement or any sort of gold or silver or whatever

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:09.000
currency or glitch of electric space you decide to invest in

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.760
um it's corrosive so uh that brings us to our topic our

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.040

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:55.400
I feel it can you feel it oh I feel it coming here it is

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.540
the Dark Harbor that's where the destination is tonight there's a place called The Dark Harbor

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.920
and here where you cannot serve God and Ammon um

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.500
we hold a Sacred Space and we do so through guarding these texts and that's

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.959
what I'm going to bring to you are some texts in

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:32.099
if you were there in the first century if you step out the door and get a whiff of the air it's the first century yeah

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.040
and the dudes it was you know we started to have our money all in common

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.060
yeah so we sold things off and we gave it to Peter and this one guy this one

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.080
guy and his wife they sold their stuff and they didn't give it all to Peter

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.040
and uh what happened Peter got really angry and

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.819
a couple of people got smitten yeah uh smiting throw smiting

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.900
um and dead and what is funny is most people know this episode you know this is ananias and Sapphira that I'm talking

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.199
about right from the book of Acts most people know that episode

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:26.580
um but John goldenmouth who is this wonderful oh he's a you know

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.680
he's a wonderful wonderful scholar and teacher and you know great

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.580
homily writer I'm uh yeah he's into the mystery he knows what the mystery is you know he's

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:49.320
living too close to it and uh yeah he says you know it was Peter right okay

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.120
the miracle that happened you know it was um maybe maybe not so much

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.620
fantasy because at the time that it happened people didn't mourn the death

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.620
of these two they didn't mourn them right they just they went in you gotta understand they went into Peter

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.280
in front of Peter close the doors open the doors to dead people

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.500
right um smitten smoted smut

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.479
and you don't realize that um uh uh what the effect of that was watch the effect

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:33.000
he's John goldenmass says it's not it it wasn't about

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.580
um whether or not there was mourning for the dead and how the reaction the crowd was it created an environment of Terror

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.300
of Terror and that kept the community operating

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.240
isn't that marvelous it's fantastic um well done

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.400
well done we're gonna look now we're gonna go to a text and we're going to

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.880
look at this in living I want to I Wanna I wanna step further in okay you know

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.220
the atmosphere you know how it is um those of you who are in The Cult you

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:19.500
get and I'm sorry but the warning is tonight um you're in a cult right you're looking at the cult from

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:27.539
the inside that's the perspective that I can give you is to be to be gazing I'm

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:32.940
offering you the templum right you think Tim from his building it's not

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:39.060
template minutes earliest form is a space it's a space where an Etruscan her

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:46.560
respects comes out quarters the universe yeah and creates a space in which can be

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.500
housed the image and that image reflected

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.660
into your reality um drives everything

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.300
it's the it's the quantum physics um by the way I've met a a very nice

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:10.740
just by way of break and we'll jump in the text I I want to let you know that I've been uh look trying to follow along

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:17.580
with you as well and we have a lot of very intelligent um people out there who are jumping in

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:25.319
and want to participate in this uh in this group in this group I'd like

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:30.479
to take us to that group where I can respond back and forth with you so Rob

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:36.660
keep an eye uh keep an eye Rob is there anything incredibly uh uh intelligent

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:44.220
that has been thrown out there or something that we must is there anything we have to grab onto before we continue

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:50.819
I don't want to um we've got discuss the paper rail we've

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:56.160
got to go into the people that's what we've got to get that's where that's the

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.860
first question of the night and should be answered really so well I'm I'm up for answering that and

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:08.520
but I don't want to um stop you waxing my recorder I don't want to

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:15.840
interrupt interrupt that but yeah we want a longer show nobody's nobody's got anywhere to go and

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:22.139
we've got they want to learn okay okay Ron I don't talk about the

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:27.419
vehicle at some point okay just jump in whenever it's it's uh

00:08:27.419 --> 00:08:32.820
it it feels whatever you feel the spirit Rob whenever you moved

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:39.000
um I'll jump in okay I will I will okay fantastic so

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.519
um we started out we're uh tonight we're going to go to a very special place I want to start with our

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:54.360
um our dead physician our uh of Nero I want to go to his work and I just want

00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:01.140
to look at a couple of words and then from there I'm going to take you I want to show you the Dark Harbor and what it

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:06.540
is and I got a warrior on tonight's Journey you may feel disoriented uh you

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:14.360
may feel things around you are changing don't let that um temporary side effect of a

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:20.700
multi-dimensional travel disturb you um just welcome welcome it's a it's a

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:26.820
pleasure okay hit it let's pull up uh

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:33.480
um andromicus give us and dramedicus please all right I want to go back to the first

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:40.440
lines and I'm going to read it to you in Greek

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:46.560
so you can hear it and we'll speed up our translation until we get to a point that you know we just Reach This rich

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:54.600
soil are you ready yeah here yeah yeah hear me right hear me

00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:01.380
right learn learn the Incredible strength of the

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:07.519
mini throned antidote oh Caesar

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:12.660
it's The Giver of unassailable freedom

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.399
hear me Nero

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:25.320
they call upon her as hilarene

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:34.560
they call upon her as Galena they call up her upon her as El Dion

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.860
and who is the they these are the ehita that we're talking about what isn't a

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.800
kidnai an aqueous is a Viper

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:52.680
what is an Echidna an Echidna is one of the eoboloi

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.839
the throwers the Slingers literally the Slingers of poison

00:10:57.839 --> 00:11:03.959
of EOS and that EOS is printed in this text Who

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:10.980
are the echidni right here we go we're in the right they call

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:17.519
her these three names right they invoke her right as

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:24.260
these three um and then we get a funny hey who are known

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:34.860
and that is most literally she who does not

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:44.940
have a mind for she who does not have a regard for that is she who is UN afraid of

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:52.880
of what the cyanic Harbor the Dark Harbor

00:11:53.279 --> 00:12:00.420
that's who we're invoking yeah and you ask me what is the Dark

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:05.579
Harbor and I'm gonna take you to the Dark

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:13.079
Harbor um but before we do before we get there um the that's just the beginning he then

00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:20.060
from there talks about the different venoms that Galena

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:28.920
is able to navigate okay all right good and he says even

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.839
the Palmer medes

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.480
the Palma nades the sacred communion or

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:46.680
the sacred drink yeah the sacred drink the sacred if you

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:52.320
want to translate potion you could translate it potion but the potion of

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:59.399
the the medes who follow the medwa the medwa

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:07.800
yeah isn't that nice that's uh that's nice um so where is this Harbor in order to

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.899
get you to the harbor I want to step toward it and the direction we're going

00:13:12.899 --> 00:13:20.220
to do that is through because because we're necromancers right for those of you who who don't already know or you

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:28.200
missed a meeting were necromancers and we call up the ghost of the Dead

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.360
yes and we bring them we bring them I have a special project

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:39.360
for anyone who is interested I'll just throw in this announcement for

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.579
anyone who is interested in this necromantic tactic

00:13:44.579 --> 00:13:51.899
practice if you would like to talk to a ghost I have one for you

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:58.200
and I have a and why would you do that why

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:06.540
would you call up a ghost right because only for one reason because we want to talk to the devil right we want to know

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:11.579
right we want to have that Oracle that's why we're necromancers

00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:16.620
uh yeah it's a switch your polls for a minute north to south

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:24.180
right just turn them around um uh under these circumstances all of a

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:30.120
sudden we're we find ourselves as communicators right with spirits of the

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:36.060
Dead this is the necromantic ancient world and it has to do with a lot of

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:43.680
mathematics I met a physicist this week was finishing his uh PhD in

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.860
um a condensed matter physics

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:57.959
yeah and the changes from phase to phase and he's looking at mathematics

00:14:57.959 --> 00:15:03.480
he's looking at mathematics this is very interesting he's looking at mathematics and he wants

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:09.360
to know how it is because he's an engineer as well and he wants to know

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:16.440
how it is the Greeks were able to engineer with Calculus when

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:25.860
calculus hadn't been written yet right um yeah so I went over to the shelf and

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:31.440
I got my Greek mathematics broken down and I opened it to a random page where

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:37.620
the Muse led me and it's the calculus

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:44.699
um through the language that they're able to convey they're able to express the calculus with their own

00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:49.800
language their algebra and you say wait a minute Greece didn't have algebra yeah

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:55.800
yeah let me show you let me show you the Greek mathematical words okay let me

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:03.899
show you this is fantastic stuff dude um what was his name the the Archimedes

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:10.320
right and what he was able to do this stuff is oh you guys are you you guys

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:17.760
are gonna love it it's it's fantastic this is some of these types yeah go ahead anyway uh I spoke to Lord

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.980
Byron it's one of the comments from Duncan's you absolute brilliant

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:29.459
comments and he's quoting you he's quoting you so

00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:36.839
are these physics working when you're talking to Lord Byron yeah okay good excellent Direction how

00:16:36.839 --> 00:16:44.459
are these physics working right so um basically you have to

00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:50.040
um draw the spirit you have to draw the spirit and then

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:57.660
um control or bind the Spirit uh in a in a binding that's

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:05.520
akin to um I think the physicists call it entanglement now yeah they call it entanglement so you

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:11.280
bind Byron and force Byron like young who I'm

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.558
very rude to um and for good reasons right and by the

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:23.760
way okay we should go to Young's red book because everybody knows that almond

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:31.740
is in it everybody knows that young is looking for the girl who is the half Viper

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:36.679
um half half girl girl Viper

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:44.160
and why is he coming up with that was it um was it something that he was

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:50.460
into what yeah do you see why we need this

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:57.120
cult why we need to go there yeah so okay um ask your question ask the question

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:03.900
again uh to me Rob please man we've got to go with the purple

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:10.559
we we want to know what this purple is you want to go to the purple okay it's

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:16.399
got to be a discussion okay upon the Chatters

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:23.940
nobody really knows what the purple is or understands the people and it should right it should

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:29.580
be cleared up people should know and that's why we need we need to go directly to the okay this is going to

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:35.280
require a bit of um harsh things are going to be get kind

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:42.299

here there we go and you'll notice you'll notice that it's essentially a curve

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:29.400
right and in a little Inlet of some sort you know a little a little place or a

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:37.440
fold and you'll notice a lot of comparisons to folds right we got togas and then we get lap or bosom

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:44.039

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:05.880
or lap well there's a lot of difference between bosom and lab right and I know bosoms but what is this

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:14.820
thing here well cut to the chase people anytime that you need to catch the chase go to Alice Alice in Wonderland she will

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:43.919
go if you go if that page were back up here and it's okay it doesn't need to be but if you go to to number two you'll

00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:49.679
see I DOI on it well what kind of idea on

00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:56.159
this word is particularly this word is particularly the

00:24:56.159 --> 00:25:03.120
um the female genitalia okay bring up the Original Latin text

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:10.020
please Yep this one oh beautiful excellent so thank you very much I

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:15.179
appreciate that Chewie um look at monile

00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:21.480
yeah what is the monile and it's not just any Manila it's monile ipsum

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.820
her very what her own monile now if you look this up

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:34.260
which um we can we can go ahead we can show them the extended definition of monilay yeah look at this necklace or

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:39.659
collar right notice that it starts talking about jewels but something that

00:25:39.659 --> 00:25:46.799
you might miss is that this is the Latin Gemma and I just want you to keep that in mind and look here we have the

00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:54.059
relationship to um Greek mianos or mionus right and

00:25:54.059 --> 00:26:02.460
those are from the word Miana to uh um and and our root for Mania right so to

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:09.900
be in a state of mania to um maniacos right they have anyway

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:18.659
um so what she's doing and that fits the text that this is from because Medea does this with her body she does this

00:26:18.659 --> 00:26:25.559
and when she is when she is done it says she turns into a fury

00:26:25.559 --> 00:26:32.340
and runs off she runs off and she's ready for for battle now but she's

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:39.360
putting this stuff on her it's it's okay this is that's okay it's on her virgin

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:45.539
on her virgin sinus a sinus is a sinus it's a an

00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:51.900
opening right oh a pocket right a pocket that you could have Safe

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:59.580
Harbor in it's the very word for Harbor in Corpus Corpus means Harbor

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.799
right so we're halfway there all we need is the Dark Harbor where is the where is

00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:12.919
the darkness yeah so and that's why we need the Echidna you got to have those Viper girls if you're gonna have yeah

00:27:12.919 --> 00:27:18.900
go ahead can we go back and draw that Alish back up

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.900
horses

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:35.299
lower down so I mean no no not that one you know yeah

00:27:35.299 --> 00:27:42.900
no there we go there we are yes then it's in per kilio suspending money

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:48.140
low Colo and a color worn by horses

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:57.059
yeah what is it yeah so what is um okay so here's here we need to take

00:27:57.059 --> 00:28:02.880
the next step as philologists see where it tries to derive the word and it gives

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:09.120
you the Sanskrit that's that's related to um notice that for the Latin that says

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.940
we get Gemma right so so wait a minute where these things have to do with each

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:22.679
other bring up gamma there we go Gemma right and look at the top here from gimmo that there's where

00:28:22.679 --> 00:28:29.940
your Greek is is at its essential a swelling

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:37.919
yeah it's a a swelling and what is a swelling in Antiquity a

00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:44.400
precious stone or a bud

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.679
right um nice nice

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:56.220
yeah but if you if you read on the top um and you just go ahead and you click

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.860
on demo and you keep tracing you keep following the word back

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:06.559
um you get that swelling is ultimately a pregnancy

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:13.500
yeah so when you reach inside the dragon's head

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:19.500
you pull out that stone and this is for those of you with ears

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:24.899
to hear and I'm jumping ahead Rob we're getting to the we're getting to the red

00:29:24.899 --> 00:29:32.159
head right we're getting to the red-headed boy okay so I guess there's a few comments on Reddit off from Duncan G

00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:38.659
example what's that I'm loving the comments um

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:44.039
in the comments thank you what kind of

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:51.899
things are being discussed in the comments Rob oh it's it's kind of getting current with what you're saying so then comments

00:29:51.899 --> 00:29:57.419
with the the redhead and the pale skin with a few a few comments back

00:29:57.419 --> 00:30:03.059
but he's he's on the right he's getting the marketing with red ads hey your skin

00:30:03.059 --> 00:30:08.940
and I'm thinking what's coming so jump ahead jump ahead carry on yeah jump

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:14.220
ahead so let's Jump Ahead let's let's jump back in the time ship I know I'm a

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:21.299
terrible I'm a terrible date but from here let's blow this joint for

00:30:21.299 --> 00:30:29.520
now and let's go we're still we're still maintaining that we're finding that Dark Harbor right and let's Jump Ahead in

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:35.100
time to the 12th century when we and we've got this thing called the Codex

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:42.720
waluani yeah and the Codex wallawani is this terrible the Latin is awful it's it's a

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:50.100
murder I'd rather I'd rather go outside and fight with the coyotes and the dingoes I'm completely serious

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:57.240
um in our range War that's going on here I would much rather do that than work with this Latin it's awful it's no one

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:04.080
of the guys in the Renaissance turn around and they're like they were like you know this language thing is awful we

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:10.559
have to go back to what um Cicero was doing and you read guys like petrarch oh

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:16.200
you would love petrarch's secret oh and I almost forgot to tell you I was I

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:22.679
started to let me mention it now now that I remember for those of you who want the extra Challenge and you want to

00:31:22.679 --> 00:31:28.679
get in you're interested in the necromancy side of this satanic

00:31:28.679 --> 00:31:33.960
initiation um go talk to Lord Byron Lord Byron

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:41.880
follow the way of Cain the mystery the way of Cain Lord Byron

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:52.020
and when you get there you'll find the devil and the devil will speak to you directly

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:57.360
and you will speak back directly

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:04.880
um for those of you who have ears to hear you know and respect

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:12.899
this process so again it's necromancy but you're going to call up the dead to do that right go get Byron

00:32:12.899 --> 00:32:18.840
the way of Cain and working Rob do you have anything to say about the way of Cain yeah I think

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:25.200
about the way it came we you've got to let him know how to get older the way it came it's a play it's a play by Lord

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.679
Byron

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.779
and as you read through it you'll understand what arm is on about

00:32:36.779 --> 00:32:42.059
you'll understand you'll get the idea behind the way it came

00:32:42.059 --> 00:32:49.200
it's a very good it's a very good leader I really enjoyed it myself because you enjoy your conversation with

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:54.779
Lucifer as much as I I did yeah yeah it's getting around about for that

00:32:54.779 --> 00:33:01.440
reason the reason the reasoning behind it's starting to get into morals and

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:07.820
reasoning and how does the devil how does it how did the devil strike you

00:33:08.299 --> 00:33:12.299
reasonable reasonable

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:18.539
that's the way it goes isn't it it's reasonable it's written by Lord

00:33:18.539 --> 00:33:24.659
Byron who's clever guy yeah real clever go you know well educated individual

00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:30.779
who's formulated this way of this narrative to

00:33:30.779 --> 00:33:37.740
take you on a journey that initiates you because the initiation for me is the

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:45.960
change of perception a new part of knowledge coming into you that you can use yourself it uses you can use that

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:53.039
knowledge yourself then yeah if you're reading from these guys who

00:33:53.039 --> 00:33:59.059
have tried they've laid things down for that purpose

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:05.580
I'd say that that's the magic for me that's the magic when you read it and it changes your perception and you think

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:13.320
I get where this guy is coming from it doesn't mean you have to buy it and become it what it means is

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:19.580
you acknowledges me I don't talk too much

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:27.179
you yeah no you uh uh so for those of you want to talk to Lucifer I encourage

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:32.820
you to and I I uh for the for the rest of you who just want to come along for

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:39.060
the ride who may be such a personal you know calling isn't isn't there or isn't

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:45.480
there yet um I recommend some more Medea let's um so let me just make sure I finish

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:52.200
covering this text before we get to the to the red-headed kid I know that's the fun part we're gonna look guys we're

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:57.960
gonna spit someone tonight this is great you're gonna love it but I want you to see I just want you to make sure that

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:07.940
you understand that text with Medea is talking about what she is doing is she is getting ready and she puts this on

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:15.660
her private parts she puts it on her private parts and not just on it but in

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:25.079
it and makes herself into this Fury if you you might you might could say uh

00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:32.640
uh mean AD okay but um the text says Fury turns her into a

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:38.640
fury um this medicine that she's and later you remember that she is the black

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:45.420
vulture that's tortures Prometheus everybody loves Prometheus right

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:53.640
everybody whoops let me turn that everybody loves Prometheus um she is the one get this she takes a

00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:03.540
drug from blood that comes from his liver

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:10.079
all right so now you're gonna want again you're gonna be disorder you're gonna say am I in fairy tale world what no no

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:17.520
let's stick with reality okay if we go to the kotec Codex walawani from 12th

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:25.099
century right and we read the Latin it's a just a base descriptions of

00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:32.940
Medea's fire or Greek fire and it has a nice a nice uh group of

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:40.859
ingredients for the um incendiary beautiful and then but within this incendiary formula is

00:36:40.859 --> 00:36:49.140
sandwiched um these instructions and I thought I would just bring those to you and let

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:55.040
you digest them the first the first thing that we do is we need a red

00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:00.960
teenage boy with lots of pimples

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:07.440
lots of pimples the more pimples the better right that's not that's my that's my addition it's the more the better the

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:14.280
text just says with the pimples so um a youth with pimples has to be the

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:21.359
red hair you take this guy that says you lure him into a banquet you lure him to

00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:31.800
a banquet and you give him drinks that will put him into the bacchic state

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:38.040
yeah that'll put him into that influence in in influence state

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:46.260
possessed into that possessed State and for 30 days you keep him in a banquet

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:51.980
that is designed to fatten and heat him

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:58.800
now you don't let him get near the dancing group don't do it

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:06.359
it's always they have to stay at a distance he has to be able to see them and they're there but he's not allowed

00:38:06.359 --> 00:38:14.700
to satisfy himself okay so this is again this is from the Codex waluani

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:21.119
okay and it's I think it's a Welshman um I read that this a guy did a

00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:26.220
dissertation on it and um it's a real it's a crazy text but

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:31.980
um his Latin is awful it's absolutely awful I mean it's just painful but

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:38.460
here's what um here's what you do with the boy now is everybody with me so you've got him and you get keeping this

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:43.859
way for 30 days it says now during this 30-day period for those of you in

00:38:43.859 --> 00:38:50.339
satanic initiation who are interested in the Alchemy side and then the um psychedelic Renaissance this is

00:38:50.339 --> 00:38:57.119
probably the part that you would enjoy okay so you take a copper pod and it

00:38:57.119 --> 00:39:03.839
describes a covering that's made for it that has what's obviously some kind of pressure release

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:10.859
right and you put this thing it's a cauldron you put it on a over fire and it's for heating well anyway you take

00:39:10.859 --> 00:39:16.140
this thing this cauldron and you put toads into it

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:22.980
toads and you feed those toads a regimented diet for 30 days

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:28.800
and it includes the milk it includes milk you're actually attaching them and

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:34.380
forcing them to take nourishment it's not it's obviously not meant for

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:41.700
you know what I mean it's not meant for uh toad consumption right it's not a bug

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:47.040
um but you take them for 30 days and after I think it's like 15. I don't remember how many days it is but then

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:54.599
you add this sea snake or sea crate it's some kind of it's a sea snake and

00:39:54.599 --> 00:40:01.520
um you have to have fed it though you have to have fed it just hang in there with me human flesh first

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:08.640
human phosphorus I don't know why it makes a difference I'm just interested in the pharmacology right and uh anyway

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:14.220
so um you keep this thing going for 30 days and there's other things that you pile

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:20.339
into it and you make this kind of lit half living half dead

00:40:20.339 --> 00:40:28.380
concoction um that you're gonna now boil and what

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:34.980
looks like maybe distillation or attempts to um you know good out good alchemy

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:43.260
you know it's uh good stuff anyway um so your redhead boy after 30 days what do

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:49.500
you do you're stuck with him right well you haven't even got that's not even why you brought him right

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:57.960
you haven't even achieved the effect that you're looking for you take that redhead teenager now who's under the

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:05.940
influence of tremendous amounts of drugs and you take this guy out and you lay a bed of coals down

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:12.240
and you put a spit over it and you tie into the spit now wait a minute that

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:18.300
why do you do that because you have to keep him a certain temperature right you

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:26.220
have to raise his temperature okay so um and then you cut his wrists and you

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:32.220
bleed him you bleed him right now it says you're supposed to

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:38.099
bring him just to the point of death just to the point of death you put him

00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:44.339
in that inner that intermediate space right and then unfortunately the text

00:41:44.339 --> 00:41:49.680
doesn't say you bring him back but um

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:55.740
I think we would be um I think we would be remiss as

00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:02.880
Scholars if we didn't notice a ritual here of burning off what they call burning off mortality

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:08.400
so the redhead is actually he's one of these scythians you know and he's doing

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:15.599
his thing he's going through his initiation and um yeah and um does he come out of it I

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:23.880
hope so I hope so I hear two out of three babies don't even yeah hey man we got we've got to

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:29.540
come after Mario hi Ariel David

00:42:31.619 --> 00:42:37.680
I am not sure I can't come back with that aerial

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:43.740
please because that's interesting real interesting yeah I find that very interesting

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:52.440
was David initiated yeah David is that an initiation

00:42:52.440 --> 00:43:00.240
some connection there you you don't know what happens to that

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:09.780
redhead um but the you're not done with the formula yet

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:15.960
right because you're taking his blood and you can't let it coagulate they say if it coagulates it's no good

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:24.000
it's no good yeah so you have to keep it you have to keep it um from coagulating and then

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.420
they take um that with the blood of the Dragon and what you take from his head when you

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:37.260
cut it off and these dragons are the guys like the Wolves who are living out in the caves

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:42.300
yeah it's pretty cool and they um um you contract them with the right

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:48.660
drugs offer them the right drugs right and they will

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:54.079
um be subdued uh they are I don't

00:43:54.079 --> 00:44:00.740
they say a dragon is um

00:44:01.319 --> 00:44:07.800
scary feared by all it's neither a god nor a

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:13.800
mortal neither a god nor a mortal and the one

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:22.220
that guarded Medea's fleece feared only Medea

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:29.460
was considered a god killer and if you'll notice that she put she

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:35.339
put that Dragon into the death state in order to claim the fleece

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:40.740
right and she was very upset about it she was very upset about it because you

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:46.380
know Prometheus is a man yeah and

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:51.599
yeah beautiful stuff the dragon comes back anyway um when she burns up this Palace and

00:44:51.599 --> 00:44:57.060
kills everybody you know I'm sorry it's not like that's funny but her yeah it's

00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:03.420
a long story it's a long story probably not worth it oh by the way for those of you who know that Medea or say Medea

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:09.300
killed her children right um the Corinthians made that up there

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:15.240
was an oracle that went out right after uh the kids of Medea were were killed

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:23.339
her sons were killed um and she was able to Escape From the City uh they got sick with a plague and

00:45:23.339 --> 00:45:32.099
the Oracle said it's because you killed media's kids and claimed that she did right it's terrible terrible those

00:45:32.099 --> 00:45:37.380
Corinthians should be you know good good plague on the Corinthians hail Satan

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:43.079
plague on the Corinthians right sir plague in those people yeah anyway let's

00:45:43.079 --> 00:45:50.400
go let's keep going through the text um uh we have to we can't leave off the you

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:56.640
take the dragon's blood and a stone that you take out of the middle of his brain

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:03.900
yeah okay and you take all of these ingredients and um then you're you're set to be able to

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:11.400
make that sabot there's a place okay think of it as a dimensional place that you can

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:17.700
project yourself this is how they talk about it right this is that this is

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:24.599
their world you project yourself this is fairy queen stuff right and that's why that's why Rob is

00:46:24.599 --> 00:46:30.240
chasing the fairy queen he's chasing mab he's chasing the medwa

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:37.380

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:34.920
the redheaded boy and we took his blood and we mixed it with the blood of the dragon and with the gym it comes from

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:39.960
his head um and now we're we have the ingredients

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:45.780
from The Cauldron um and these we can transfuse to burn

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:51.900
off the mortality remember in the initiation of Lucius

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:57.359
remember Demeter is working the boy dimathon

00:47:57.359 --> 00:48:03.900
yeah and her mother walks in and she's like oh my God what are you doing

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:11.339
and the the text says that she was putting him into the fire right and she says she says look you

00:48:11.339 --> 00:48:16.980
ungrateful jerk right I was gonna burn off his mortality

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:24.420
well now you know forget about it let him die right Isn't that cool

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:30.720
um and so yeah yeah he uh is he your is he your redhead he's in the position of

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:37.020
your Reddit you know Rob mentioned today and I want to talk about a question about

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:44.160
um pedophilia pedophilia I want to open it up to the most uncomfortable academic discussion

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:50.579
possible because um we have a uh we have the freedom if

00:48:50.579 --> 00:48:57.540
we are respectful and clinical to be able to ask some questions and from

00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:05.160
Antiquity you know they've got a word right pederasty right it's a it's a big

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:13.079
thing if look guys if we want to find that kid that was with Jesus in the garden right right then we have to know

00:49:13.079 --> 00:49:20.460
we have to know what is the pederasty anyway we'll talk about that I'm wrapping up and uh um

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:26.099
we're back at the at the Dark Harbor and with the potion of the medes and we're

00:49:26.099 --> 00:49:32.099
trying to figure out what Nero is Conjuring through this great Arc you

00:49:32.099 --> 00:49:37.500
know this Arch physician and what they're trying to do and

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:43.980
it is consistently described as the same process

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:50.280
so it's the um it's the what do you mean we're wrapping up what

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:57.839
do you mean yeah well I mean you know what with the with the text yeah with the

00:49:57.839 --> 00:50:05.640
text right we can't let anybody go without getting this way of cane people need to figure out how to access it and

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:11.460
get to it because I got it I got to it through you you sent it and now it's

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:18.119
changed and I'm not the best researcher and certainly wasn't at the time what Jane

00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:25.800
put it but I found it difficult I found it difficult I needed a title I needed something to go with so I'll try

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:32.099
and sort that out and put it in the chat in the comments on the video and I'll

00:50:32.099 --> 00:50:40.400
try again a link or if anybody can help and get a link I'd appreciate it yeah if you um

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:45.200
and we need to get more

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:57.240
we get taken off into different areas so we've got to come back to it and try and

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:04.260
stick on point where the purple what the purple white there why would I wait

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:10.079
everywhere when you look around weights it's the paper reel and we've got to discuss the

00:51:10.079 --> 00:51:16.260
paper here because it's yeah it's a it's a very interesting subject that makes this

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:22.700
we haven't we haven't covered it yet we need to

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:28.500
you perhaps need to do an episode entirely on them you know

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:36.240
it's not too much up well just to give questions people will have lots of questions just to give the people a taste just to

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:42.119
give the people a taste remember this is something I said all the time I don't say all the time I say it to my students

00:51:42.119 --> 00:51:47.300
and um who are learning quick um

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:53.579
you have to realize those you know this the the purple trade and Antiquity was

00:51:53.579 --> 00:52:01.500
huge right the name of the Phoenicians comes from it so and it's a extremely uh extremely

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:07.380
valuable commodity um I've looked at the drug trades and Antiquity

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:14.640
um and it's on a on par you know with the drug trade so uh yeah if um the

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:22.859
plants that you can get and where you can get them from you know um yeah the mirax can you get the mirror

00:52:22.859 --> 00:52:28.319
right it's expensive it's more expensive you know um what Rob you reminded me

00:52:28.319 --> 00:52:34.819
today marks uh more costly than gold baby yeah yeah

00:52:34.819 --> 00:52:39.960
we've got a question are you taking questions that's

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:45.839
yeah let's take some let's take some questions let's go ahead and take some questions I'm trying to look out for

00:52:45.839 --> 00:52:53.520
them yeah it go ahead keep them coming get the questions and

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:59.700
if I've missed any if I've missed anybody I I apologize and I'm a novice and I'm trying my best

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:05.520
that's all I can say Harbor

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:10.800
let's finish though with the dark with the Dark Harbor or the cyanic

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:16.980
harbor I hate to I hate to but we need to make sure and get this image so this

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:27.420
Harbor is the culpos right the vagina as you saw and so you you have a person who

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:35.640
is producing a communion substance that Gemma that gimma that was with the the

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:44.460
Virgin sinuses of Medea that gimma that Jewel is also called the cop

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:51.240
so when lady Babylon presents her cup of cornea to us it doesn't surprise any of

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:58.619
us at all it didn't surprise the nicolations right that Gemma that Jewel that is

00:53:58.619 --> 00:54:07.800
there and she ejaculates right she has to enter that and they picture Medea harvesting Prometheus and

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:13.980
when she harvests him when she harvests him he enters a state

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:21.480
of relaxation from intense um uh rage

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:27.480
yeah chained to his Rock in the Caucasus

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:35.280
yeah gorgeous stuff that you can smell the scythian and Amazonian influences in in

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:41.160
the ancient ritual especially if you see the drugs and that's always just always

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:47.220
follow the drugs because it can't it doesn't lead us astray right um there's substances you use and they

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:52.640
do certain things so yeah any good questions yeah amen

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:58.559
Cranium Cranium maximum is asking are we finished with the original text let's

00:54:58.559 --> 00:55:07.140
see if Irish promise promise not to come between it I'm gonna snow yeah yeah so

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:15.180
Medea comes out just to finish that off to make sure that we've got the picture she is inserting that oil right that

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:21.359
that drug um within her vagina and on her gym that

00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:28.140
is the source of the communion yeah and then she runs off crazily

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:35.700
right to to battle essentially um so uh that

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:40.920
now you know why they call them the sorceresses they call them the drug

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:48.540
wielders right this is it's a huge deal and the uh ability to create these

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:56.339
formulas I mean imagine just for a minute step back for a minute say um okay these priestesses who were involved

00:55:56.339 --> 00:56:02.160
in all of this worship of this midwife and this poison shedder Artemis the

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:10.260
poison shutter it um uh who are in these women's a realm of magic and creation and

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:18.359
destruction these now you know what the Sorceress is that's what lady Babylon is she just

00:56:18.359 --> 00:56:24.359
does it in every language right she's able to bridge that Gap in

00:56:24.359 --> 00:56:30.660
every language um so yeah gorgeousness and uh uh

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:36.660
gorgiosity all wrapped up another good question is Dark Harbor is Madea's body

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:41.839
yeah is this the terrier yeah

00:56:41.839 --> 00:56:47.880
is this the Beast I hear it I hear it do you hear them Rob is this the Beast

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:54.980
right yes this is the theriac yes right it's it's

00:56:54.980 --> 00:57:02.819
dead right we have to find that we have to find that Dark Harbor right in

00:57:02.819 --> 00:57:09.540
um we don't have the sotera we don't have the savior until we have that so

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:15.240
um yeah imagine it's a think of the proposition of bathing your fetus

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:22.980
bathing your fetus in venom yeah in order to bring

00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:28.579
um in order to bring somebody that could use a little bit more of their brain

00:57:28.579 --> 00:57:35.000
or an interesting question do you get killed if you refuse to cook

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:44.480
um you're not that you're there voluntarily right um you've come to be initiated

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:50.640
you know and it's not like uh um I haven't read a text I'm not going

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:57.540
to make anything up because there's no reason to I'm not getting paid for this right um there's no I've never read an account

00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:02.760
of an initiate who wigged out got got CR

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:08.819
you know I was like wait a minute it's too much no I haven't and that's probably because

00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:15.119
they're always drugging them yeah you always yeah you you put in the place

00:58:15.119 --> 00:58:17.119
um

00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:33.240
together yeah

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:39.299
that's what I was yeah that's what I was discussing that's what I remember Rob that's what the physicist was so

00:58:39.299 --> 00:58:47.339
interested in love it love it now what does that mean okay having said that Rob what is it what does it mean to you what

00:58:47.339 --> 00:58:53.940
does that tell you within that purple guy of the uh of the mollusk

00:58:53.940 --> 00:59:01.200
it's the bottom brackets trip to main precursors that's what we were discussing today I'm learning here with

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:06.599
this because I've got to grow me but I haven't got past burning and I'm

00:59:06.599 --> 00:59:14.819
learning this today at real time tryptamine pre-cases is what you've what we've discussed earlier and um

00:59:14.819 --> 00:59:21.000
gotta go and get that through in the end yet there's a the purple is going to be a

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.460
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] big discussion there isn't anybody discussing it I hope that it's only

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:32.280
going to be yourself no this is the Renaissance Robin you

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:38.880
gotta remember baby this is the Renaissance you know we're we're here at the Psychedelic Renaissance it hit the

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:45.420
medicine we're gonna be there you know figuring these things out there there are doctors and therapists right now

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:52.079
trying to do that so yeah um why do you think Rob that they're

00:59:52.079 --> 00:59:56.960
looking for the for the mystery of the purple

00:59:57.119 --> 01:00:03.240
I think I think the following the text I think the following the textbook

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:10.559
Century after Century this is getting passed through I think it's I think they're seeking the

01:00:10.559 --> 01:00:16.200
people in this game on this personally and I think yeah it's going

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:23.160
on for a very long time definitely yeah yeah could be wrong and I'm more than willing

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:28.260
to investigate and find out pretty long budget there's no

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:33.480
there's no huge hubris here where I think I'm correct you know you can

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.859
research you find stuff out

01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:53.640
I'm willing to bet it makes it was explained a lot when it comes to the Templars and that whole allegation of

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:59.700
licking the anus or the penis for the purple yeah I'm I'm willing to bet it

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:06.720
had you know it um it's it surfaces right it surfaces the use of it does

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:12.299
um I'm watching the Queen's funeral

01:01:12.299 --> 01:01:19.619
Crown is sitting on a cherry and purple pillow it's National monitorium purple pillow

01:01:19.619 --> 01:01:28.680
the funeral casket is covered with a Tyrion purple it a huge cloth confidence and then it's

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:34.380
got the the Royal Standard I'm not sure how to pronounce that

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:40.740
correctly but right on the corner you've got the Irish side of it and you've got the

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:47.099
heart with what onion soups is a civil with a brush toe to write on the corner

01:01:47.099 --> 01:01:53.099
and the Queens passed away but I'm also

01:01:53.099 --> 01:01:58.380
looking at that image and thinking wow purple everywhere

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:04.140
you've got a shovel on the corner what it's all there in the symbols isn't it

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:09.920
it makes you think like I say I don't know if I'm pregnant

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:17.660
can you lick that because you run up to that casket lick the purple and get high or no

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:23.000
foreign

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:36.900
because default they pulled out to they pulled out to jump it from a cave what had been there

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:43.380
how many years I don't know how many years it had been there but as soon as you hit the sunlight the color

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:49.799
was radiant that the guy and vegetarian purple darling only gets better it

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:55.980
doesn't degrade in time until he gets better apparently

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:01.020
extract

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:08.700
being difficult to extract so when you when you have it when you

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:14.579
have it why do you why do you need the why do you need the blood of the of the

01:03:14.579 --> 01:03:20.400
redhead or the dragon why do you need these put it can't I think it can only

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.099
be because you're potentiating right so you've you've got your what DMT like

01:03:26.099 --> 01:03:31.980
effects and are you somehow modifying through the system through filtering it

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:37.260
through the person and they have to be of a certain Aryan makeup right and when

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:45.480
I say that everybody goes wait what did he just say right right I'm talking about the Aryans the the real ones not

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:51.480
the Mythic ones right um but the Aryans who were coming up with these with all

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:58.740
this pharmacology these antidotes um and I think yeah I think um

01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:04.260
uh there there's a reason they took the name Medea yeah and because they're

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:10.079
calling themselves medes um so there's a certain power we can't forget

01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:15.240
there's a certain power behind uh uh this whole process we're in the

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:22.500
Renaissance we're gonna discover this right we're gonna find that this cup

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:30.180
and then we're going to want to use it we're going to want to bring her back and the evangelicals know this right

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:35.460
they know it's a it's a part of the plan and that's why we are who we are hail

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.940
Satan

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:48.420
sorry I'm sorry I'm trying to I'm trying to catch up with the chats I'm trying to

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:55.319
get get through the chat I'm trying to listen but you know I'm gonna listen back I'm gonna have to listen back to this yeah but know what's been said

01:04:55.319 --> 01:04:58.099
because I've been

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:06.660
if somebody asked me somebody asked me about the painting in the background somebody asked me about

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:12.180
that I'll I'll answer that one um that painting was done at the St

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:21.240
Mary's University while I was contracted to um bring the historical reality to the

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:29.160
cynican version of Medea I was the translator and the advisor for the

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:34.880
University production and one of the participants

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:41.700
whom I was able to guide through this process

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:47.339
um that we're doing now with initiation um they uh uh

01:05:47.339 --> 01:05:52.920
um they very successfully were able to

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:59.220
well shoot the Earth was hit by a by a by a blacked out Sun

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:06.119
um for uh for a period of time yeah right from the Dark Star the Dark Star was

01:06:06.119 --> 01:06:12.240
hitting the Earth you know they had those detectors anyway where's the painting from

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:19.799
um one of these students had a class in art while we had a discussion

01:06:19.799 --> 01:06:27.980
about ancient magic and while she was across the campus I gave a talk

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:35.720
on um the image that you see painted in the painting which happened at her

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:41.640
it was a free painting day and she said she just felt like this image was coming

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:47.940
to her and so um you know it's part of the it's part of

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:54.359
the magic it's who who is the image she's bleeding right she's bleeding and

01:06:54.359 --> 01:07:01.799
she's standing in a pool of blood yeah and it almost looks like she's in

01:07:01.799 --> 01:07:07.380
the water and you are upside down who's this woman

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:13.680
if he was John and you were you know

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:22.200
um you knew that you could get bitten by an asp or by a Viper and it wouldn't it wouldn't hurt you right and you knew how

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:27.359
the Water Works you know why Lady Babylon sits on the waters

01:07:27.359 --> 01:07:32.880
right everybody knows that right um it's part of the physics that are

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:41.059
involved in the magic yeah it's uh yeah so necromancy and and

01:07:41.059 --> 01:07:49.619
Alchemy uh these are all um coming back there's a Renaissance as

01:07:49.619 --> 01:07:55.380
my my new student um uh

01:07:55.380 --> 01:08:01.380
uh physicist will be able to tell you um look people we're in an area where

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:06.480
this thing is this thing is uh is a mystery right and it's it's gorgeous

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:11.700
there's something in the cup that that's provided and that's what

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:17.460
we're almost there to to find out is what's in that cup

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:23.040
um yeah who and what is Satan

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:30.020
yeah I wouldn't know yeah who and what is Satan and who asked that Joe Jones

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:38.000
Joe Jones here's what I'm going to do James I I must remember him Charlie

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:43.560
who and what is Satan yeah um here's what

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:50.880
here's what I'd like you to do I'd like you to take that question to Byron okay when you it's a necromancy lesson

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:56.400
when you engage in necromancy you are involving

01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:03.778
a process that you can inhibit yourself and the way to uninhibit it

01:09:03.779 --> 01:09:10.679
is to randomize it um and so when you come to Byron you ask

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:15.838
him a question and through the Muse he can answer you back so here's what I

01:09:15.839 --> 01:09:22.040
want you to do go to Lord Byron this is right if if you wanted a necromancy

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:27.298
assignment here it is go to Lord Byron Joe Jones

01:09:27.299 --> 01:09:33.359
and ask the Devil Himself ask the Devil Himself

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:39.960
and if you do that I want you to come back next Sabah and I

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:46.440
want you to tell us what the devil said to you Joe Jones that is your that is

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:53.880

for it I'll come back to yeah um yeah yeah good fantastic Discord you

01:11:33.239 --> 01:11:41.159
should create this now what is that yeah and what does that have to do with Byron yeah no I'm giving you instructions go

01:11:41.159 --> 01:11:47.100
right go um you know Rob told me this week he said he shaved his head right and

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:52.380
because anybody that appears um has to appear in mourning right

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:59.540
because we recognize the death of Jehovah okay and if you you cannot be born again

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:06.659
without that state you must be in the state of recognizing the death and

01:12:06.659 --> 01:12:13.260
mourning actively mourning the death of Jehovah so um he shaved his head and he

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:19.380
and he went um that's scary he shaved his head Rob

01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:26.280
shaved his head and he told people around why he was because he was entering satanic initiation

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:31.800
so um that courage that courage we should take we should take note of that

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:36.840
those of us on this side of the pawn should take note and honor and

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:44.699
honor that and Rob don't you just want to say I simply don't care to be honest question that's my hair my hair I'll do

01:12:44.699 --> 01:12:52.219
what I want for this I'm uncomfortable freedom that's what that represents for me yeah

01:12:52.219 --> 01:12:59.120
I'll do what I want yeah that's satanic I'm sorry

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:05.460
yeah yeah amen amen right I am thee amen

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:12.840
um for those of you who are interested on the necromantic side as well it was a specialty of mine the necromancy thing

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:18.300
really turns me on so for those of you who are interested there is a seal

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:25.320
there is a seal on Young's um Lieber Novus right and what what I mean there's

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:30.659
a seal I mean young said there's a seal on it right on the work it was split up

01:13:30.659 --> 01:13:37.140
into three notebooks at a time they combined it into one right but he says there's a seal on the work

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:47.239
um and if you can break that seal um you uh um you can talk directly to Amon

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:57.480
so if you want if if Byron is not your thing go to the red book with young and dig

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:04.679
around sniff around for the magician and once you find that then and I can hear

01:14:04.679 --> 01:14:11.040
him as I'm standing here talking to you I can hear you complaining right he's ball gag so he can't he can't do much

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:16.560
you can only Mumble but um I've got his black

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:23.699
um Rod um the serpent Rod I've got it for you and I want to give it to you I want to

01:14:23.699 --> 01:14:30.659
make it um common I want to profane it so that you can use it as a key so if you're

01:14:30.659 --> 01:14:38.640
interested in necromancy side Young uh the section on the magician

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:46.040
yeah the section on the magician and look for almond look for almond and when you find Ammon

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:53.219
then present your question right what is Historia Historia is originally a

01:14:53.219 --> 01:14:59.580
question it means inquiry right in Greek but it's a question originally it's a

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:04.800
question that you propose to an oracle

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:12.600
and the oracle is able to unite herself

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:18.480
with the divinity right who is then able to work through

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:25.199
you and tell you because it's past present and future and tell you how

01:15:25.199 --> 01:15:31.080
um it's going to work yeah it's it's gorgeous stuff you don't pay her

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:37.560
right and people say oh they got treasuries and they got this and they got that and they also know that there's

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:42.719
a lethality involved that there's a lethality involved

01:15:42.719 --> 01:15:50.280
um and we know that the price of taking cash in the saturnian

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:56.820
religion if you want to call it that in the saturnian practice the price of taking any sort of

01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:05.520
compensation is immediate ejection yeah so you can't worship

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:12.360

it's not um

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:32.940
look at the look at the uh look at the go ahead and put up harmonia this is

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:38.820
what we're trying to achieve right this is harmonia

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:44.820
and harmonia was transformed

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:52.920
into a snake yeah and why was she that way because a

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:59.580
snake was her mate yeah Cadmus the one who preserved the

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:04.699
burning purple and restored the lightning

01:17:04.699 --> 01:17:11.520
so you're like what Ryan um dark dark Harbor right we're talking

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:18.600
I'm teaching you as we're working together I'm teaching you the orphic Vox I taught you the harbor and somebody

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:25.199
asked well are we done um is the is the is it the vagina it yes

01:17:25.199 --> 01:17:31.260
it is but it's more than just a vagina it's the cyanic harbor

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:36.780
where if you have ears to hear you'll know what is there

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:44.400
um Rob's people are doing this they're entering that Island right they're entering that island where

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:50.159
that Haze is lifted up right which is funny because the Greeks

01:17:50.159 --> 01:17:57.300
talk about the passages the same way there's a haze a fog

01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:02.340
yeah it's just uh it's coming out of look here's where it's coming from put

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:10.440
that show us Georgia go through some pictures of Georgia here I just want people to see yeah this is

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:18.719
the beauty this is where this this um this great Garden this great Paradise is

01:18:18.719 --> 01:18:23.600
achieved this Adam it's worse

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:32.640
wasn't Alexander the Great's mom olympius known for sleeping with snakes

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:39.420
um specifically she was known for sleeping with Armon I'll have you know

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:45.120
sleeping with Armon in the form of a serpent

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:52.020
yeah and how how do we do this it was a you know it you know back to the Egyptians right this was an Egyptian

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:57.060
thing because he had learned he was a pharaoh he didn't get to be Pharaoh

01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:03.120
without without having some knowledge some Priestly knowledge and so anyway

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:09.199
it's he's uh casting it's a mogas

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:16.560
um uh which our text right now are POI are are beasts that we're working on our

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:23.159
theriac that we're working on um it's in there yeah and

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:30.540
um yeah how do you how do you present how do you

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:37.560
present the cup that's uh I think that's yeah okay does anybody want to come

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:43.020
trying to go back I don't want to um Masonic traveling question

01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:49.199
Carl Jung what is Magic speaks of how magic requires sacrifice I don't see it

01:19:49.199 --> 01:19:54.420
as necromancy yeah so we were we want to discuss the

01:19:54.420 --> 01:20:02.340
necromancy yeah yeah research actually that's research where

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:07.560
I I bring up that person the problem is

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:13.199
I'll I'll answer that directly the problem is that Carl Jung in his in his

01:20:13.199 --> 01:20:18.320
red book so-called um is using necromantic terminology

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:23.580
right he is using a scheme a schema he's

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:30.719
using it um of the outline of the universe that was pioneered by necromancers I'll have

01:20:30.719 --> 01:20:37.739
you know I'll have you know we're in a Trulia and we're dealing with an art

01:20:37.739 --> 01:20:45.179
that Jung is able to chart out beautifully beautifully so as young a

01:20:45.179 --> 01:20:52.260
necromancer why don't you ask his patient what's your name she went off to that Russian school that

01:20:52.260 --> 01:21:00.860
they shut down because of the pedophilia isn't that it was Russian aristocrats

01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:08.040
this week in Bible study we talked about and we talked about the aristocrats that

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:15.780
they taught using the purple and and somebody asked about Mary and yeah

01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:21.780
there's a Coptic section I don't do Coptic I have a lot of respect for those those of you who do and I leave you to

01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:28.380
the science but there's a text that in Translation says that um her Midwife

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:33.739
Mary's Midwife probed her she palpated her you know insertion of two fingers

01:21:33.739 --> 01:21:41.219
and and I had to put her hand out because it was felt like it was on fire

01:21:41.219 --> 01:21:46.500
right it's the they call it the burning purple for a reason what's she doing she

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:51.540
was connected with a temple yeah she was connected with a temple and

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:58.380
what do you think they're doing it's exactly what we found in Bible study oh Jerusalem right that's not that's Temple

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:04.380
but um oh Jerusalem Samaria look what you're doing so

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:11.280
um this is a real world I want yeah I want I want people to see the real if you can start to taste it real that's

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:17.820
that's what's important we've got high pressure as well there's Rook thinks the red book came out of the

01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:24.060
drug experience by Young so youngers

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:31.400
Dublin with the dark arts and drugs according to milk

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:36.780
say this uh I know he's followed this line and that

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:45.480
that's much opinion yeah that group came out of so I could and it

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:51.540
says it took a few years off and went kind of reclusive for the period of time

01:22:51.540 --> 01:23:01.580
during that time he was a big thinking there's no evidence for it as he's dabbling and look at that

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:10.620
it's not Light reading right it's not it's not Light reading and but I do I do

01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:16.800
appreciate if you if you um if you can appreciate the power of

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:23.219
images which Jung obviously does and um like they did in Antiquity because

01:23:23.219 --> 01:23:28.739
remember the idolatry is just the the power of those images you know even one

01:23:28.739 --> 01:23:34.440
that even even one that doesn't here

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:40.920
I'm gonna I just want to show you one and give give you the appreciation

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:47.760
um yeah here oh look at what what on Earth

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:54.840
is going on in this wow viewers do you see that do you see

01:23:54.840 --> 01:24:02.880
that now I know now I know how those unions they were the first they were the original miners you know of the minds

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:08.699
they're the ones who creeped in crept in there and got done what they needed to get done

01:24:08.699 --> 01:24:16.520
um ask his patient ask his patient he'll know what it he'll know what a dragon is don't worry

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:23.100
um patchmark people if you're more interested necromantically um if you're more necromantically

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:28.739
inclined uh go to petrarch he wrote a work called the secretum I'm giving it

01:24:28.739 --> 01:24:34.560
all out tonight he speaks about the code that he uses in it okay you'll notice I think it's section

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:40.080
three five through five no or is it 350. uh I can't

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:48.060
remember um anyway it's Patrick and it's called The Secret and in the preface of that you will see

01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:57.179
the physics laid out of how this necromancy works test work uses necromancy with Augustine

01:24:57.179 --> 01:25:03.420
and in order to get there he goes through the muse

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:09.000
whom he calls yeah who does he call you read this

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.520
didn't you did didn't you rob initiate you read this didn't you

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:19.800
yeah oh okay it wasn't fine find out yeah

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:25.320
where he toss right she's the true she is that truth right

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:32.120
she is Sophia for those of you who don't realize it we're trying to find Sophia and people were asking well what about

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:38.040
it's almost like he's teasing us with both genders yeah I am because you get

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:45.540
down there you get down there and you find that aphrodite has a penis

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:51.540
yeah I'm I'm I'm I'm not kidding you if we have to go back to the earliest

01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:57.600
sculptures we'll find that she's got that penis and she she uses it and why

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:04.620
how is that part of um I wrote I wrote a book called hermaphrodites gyne Morrison Jesus

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:10.380
right so um yeah this is good stuff you people don't

01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:16.500
buy it pirated because you know fire pirate it no nobody gets it but it

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:22.280
doesn't pirate it um yeah good stuff good stuff

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:28.219
there was a question and

01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:37.380
my father the apologies yeah Patrick's the secret Patrick's the

01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:44.699
secret um Byron um if you want to speak to Satan directly and I know Joe will right

01:26:44.699 --> 01:26:53.159
report back to us and let us know as Satan told him what is the answer to his question and petrarch is working with is

01:26:53.159 --> 01:27:00.179
is working with Veritas he's working with the truth right but not just the truth on paper

01:27:00.179 --> 01:27:07.080
he's working with her so this is a sacred feminine power we

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:13.440
need to um the last thing we do before we take the red-headed boy's blood that we've

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:21.300
been putting over the spit and bleeding the the last thing we do is that we gather the wolf's testicles right so the

01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:26.460
dragons and the Wolves we have Greek text that tells us these are positions

01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:32.820
of temples right um positions at temples these are Guardians they're Guardians so you can

01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:39.060
take one of these wolves and if you get his testicles and why would a wolf be giving you his testicles

01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:44.300
because of what makes Rob so uncomfortable and that is the pederasty

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:51.060
right it comes back to the pederasty Kim biochemically it comes back to the

01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:58.260
pederasty um and hence um if we're gonna ever elucidate why

01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:05.120
that kid was with Jesus in a public park at 4am and he was naked

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:10.860
you know and it's got what can be used in Antiquity as a medicated rap

01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:17.940
you know um what what are they doing so we have to dig into that pederasty when they

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:24.360
told me you couldn't you couldn't say the Romans used drugs I was like okay it's my mission in life to find the to

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:30.239
find the the deepest darkest corners of antiquity and to dredge it up and I

01:28:30.239 --> 01:28:35.820
didn't have to go far I just had to go to the Garden of Gethsemane yeah I love it

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:42.900
what what's what's with the red head what's with the red head what's with the redhead Rob Rob's got a

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:50.940
theory about what the what the head thing are what the head thing Rob where did these red-headed Scots come from

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:56.880
oh you you would change Andrew St Andrew brought it over this there's a there's a

01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:03.440
legend there's a legend to that to not degree that

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:10.980
back wedding as the Scottish I've got scythian Heritage within them

01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:19.860
bought back by Saint Andrew who's the painting Saints and as a genetic quality that runs

01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:27.960
through so that's slightly yesterday because I said to you yeah

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:35.580
that's Canada stereotypical Scottish guy who you're talking about with the red eye pale skin

01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:42.000
and the pimples and I'm like saying yeah is he a Scottish guy and that stereotyping which is something I

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.260
shouldn't do but it is stereotype

01:29:49.219 --> 01:29:56.100
it makes you wonder is there some genetic is there some genetic

01:29:56.100 --> 01:30:01.199
um thing going on is there something involved here uh that we have to have

01:30:01.199 --> 01:30:07.139
that Aryan um that Black Sea

01:30:07.139 --> 01:30:12.540
um late Bronze Age uh Gene in in order I

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:19.320
mean in the in the Crimea right um where all the where all the

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:25.020
interest is now they're performing they still have women who are performing death rites

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:32.760
right they're performing sacrifices and um using doubts and antidotes poisons to

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:37.980
do it and uh yeah what's what uh is that the

01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:44.940
source is that the origin people are um no souls that changes have songs of

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:51.840
course that gingers have shelves they say changes have no souls I said Yellow Shark is asking me who brought

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:57.480
them over and it's it was Saint Andrew that's that that's the legend it's Saint

01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:06.300
Andrew so it's something about their genetics right it's some way that they process on

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:11.400
the chemical it's obviously they're taking it look they're taking a kid they're saying you can't sexually

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:19.800
satisfy him he has to remain in this agitated State before while you're collecting his blood and so you take a

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:25.139
kid obviously going through puberty with his pimples and by the way they're uh

01:31:25.139 --> 01:31:34.260
you know there are female performers right in sheer outfits right oiling

01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:40.199
themselves and dancing so um is this doing something

01:31:40.199 --> 01:31:47.100
um um for the redhead you know is it somehow when you put him into that death State and then presumably bring him back

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:52.739
because you're performing these uh death and Resurrection rights

01:31:52.739 --> 01:31:59.100
um is there something about his state of mind um they're A peculiar combination this

01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:05.120
is what brings us the orge right A peculiar combination of fear or panic

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:11.699
and sexual intensity um puts you into a place where you can

01:32:11.699 --> 01:32:17.280
chemically produce a substance that can that was

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:22.320
used um in this initiation I mean it's great and what do you have to do with the wolf

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:30.000
you have to get his testicles you get his testicles straight up and and so somebody can figure out put all this

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.480
biochemistry together and uh figure out what's going on but

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:42.840
genetically um there's a link there we can't we can't escape that that history you need

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:51.420
that you need the sons of God yeah to produce that substance

01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:58.080
um they say that they say that Ambrosia flows in the veins of the Gods

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:04.020
you know rob you were talking about Horsemen you were talking about Mongolian Horsemen drinking their own

01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:11.040
horse's blood in a kind of a vampiric way to stay alive to stay alive the

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:18.060
symbiasis yeah we've got yellow shark can we talk about the astrological aspects of Lady

01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:25.139
Babylon it's the water's bit elliptical plane is the best

01:33:25.139 --> 01:33:31.320
yeah it's a question but yeah the astrological aspects of Lady

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:38.219
Babylon sure I'll just mention a few things let's throw a few things out right she's that she's that queen with

01:33:38.219 --> 01:33:45.420
the Stars and she's presented uh on the Greek side as having a black cloak

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:51.960
um a black pep loss it's actually a pep loss um covered with stars cover with stars

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:57.960
and um so right away you know exactly you know exactly what religious

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:03.179
neighborhoods you're in and people say what are they doing with the story it's the religion of the Sun the moon and the

01:34:03.179 --> 01:34:10.080
stars right the saturnian Golden Age you know we worship we worship the Sun the

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:16.260
moon and the stars and what do we do with those we draw down the stars

01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:22.139
right that's that's that's what our action is so

01:34:22.139 --> 01:34:30.120
um when you go see Satan find out who those stars are right and how they can be drawn

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:36.420
um there is a universe out there there's a universe where you can be struck by

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:41.580
that lightning right and you can exist within that

01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:49.739
lightning um yeah uh do you

01:34:49.739 --> 01:34:55.460
do you want it do you have ears to hear um do you want this

01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:01.560
who wants the manual man I'll give you the manual the PGM and you can you can

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:10.320
experiment all you want you can find you can open portals and get yourself into big trouble right and push toward the

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:15.360
mystery but what amazes me is that all this mystery is about it is about one

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:21.960
Oracle it's about one Queen yeah there's no boy

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:28.219
in the garden it's all about her and somehow it get

01:35:28.219 --> 01:35:35.280
gets yanked historically it gets yanked into this masculine form

01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:42.719
where we are using the Herculean boy as a source of organic

01:35:42.719 --> 01:35:48.120
yeah and so you know we have some explaining to do if we can see this

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:54.600
history for what it is right at least we'll know that um you know I thought a week ago when it

01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:00.179
says in the Bible that Jesus was touching kids I and the people were complaining and they're like tell them

01:36:00.179 --> 01:36:06.659
to stop touching the kids and he's like his Apostles come to his disciples come

01:36:06.659 --> 01:36:13.440
and they say he says oh what are you doing he's trying to scandalize me right trying to get me in trouble

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:20.460
um that word for touch has been translated to you as touch

01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:28.620
for a reason it is also the Greek verb for to molest

01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:33.659
yeah was Jesus a child molester yes he

01:36:33.659 --> 01:36:38.699
was and his religion was satanic

01:36:38.699 --> 01:36:47.159
just like the religion of the Jews yeah satanic yes beautiful oh my it's it's

01:36:47.159 --> 01:36:52.739
gorgeous uh uh Bronze Age people back to the Bronze Age gotta go back to that

01:36:52.739 --> 01:36:59.880
Queen gotta go back to that one Queen yeah I see a note here that somebody's

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:03.380
Rob say say something

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:10.560
um I I am a sadist and my wife is a Christian

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:16.500
do you have any advice to help remove the scales from her eyes so to speak uh

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:25.020
this is Daniel yeah um Daniel uh the best tool the best tool to remove

01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:31.500
the scales is the reality take her to the Garden take her on a date to the

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:39.960
garden right be there with her and show her the boy show her the the

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:46.860
three men who are standing at a distance keeping watch keeping guard

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:55.260
in a in a public park at 4am um show her the authorities that show up

01:37:55.260 --> 01:38:01.080
right for the raid and capture Jesus show the the fighting and somebody

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:08.219
getting an ear chomped off show the boy running away right take her to ananias

01:38:08.219 --> 01:38:16.260
and Sapphira and say the Lord struck them down right show her these things right uh

01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:20.580
Jehovah Jehovah's

01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:29.100
um weakness is the reality right because because what we have

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:38.100
created from it doesn't match it it's just a reflection of the reality right and it it's important uh if you're going

01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:43.380
to um work with somebody who is within a cult

01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:48.960
right Christianity is a cult it always has been a cult it always will be a cult

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:56.159
it operates on the terms that every cult operates under and it's salvation

01:38:56.159 --> 01:39:02.340
that is offered its ionic life it's not eternal life it's ionic life that's

01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:07.620
offered is why you can make mountains move

01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:16.440
right there they are very much dialed in to the magic already without

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:21.960
them even even knowing it right they're very doubt they're Christians know they

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:27.719
know it's the apocalypse right and despite the fact that they worship a

01:39:27.719 --> 01:39:35.880
liar right and place them on the throne of tyranny despite that

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:41.639
despite that um uh uh reason

01:39:41.639 --> 01:39:47.040
we'll get to them um let me just repeat something that was

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:54.120
told to me by a union a union told me practicing Union told me and recognized

01:39:54.120 --> 01:40:00.780
for his talent um told me there's something about some um the treatment of Nazis and presenting

01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:06.120
the maternal figure to them right you present the great mother

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:13.679
find the great mother that is rejected by Jehovah and you've got your crack

01:40:13.679 --> 01:40:20.639
right um uh that power that feminine power

01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:28.920
that mother who is the virgin mother right that imagine you know in every

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:34.560
temple in every Temple you bring three forces together okay I'm just telling

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:40.560
the old old Roman magic in any Temple you bring three forces together

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:47.460
right and so if you bring the virgin the queen

01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:52.980
and the lover if you bring Aphrodite and you

01:40:52.980 --> 01:41:00.780
bring Hera era and you bring Athena then that combined

01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:07.260
power is able to um disrupt the masculine the feminine

01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:13.260
the secret is the feminine magic power is superior to the masculine

01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:19.020
that's why Zeus is always looking over the Greeks recognizes Zeus is always looking over his shoulder

01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:26.699
because the Civil has said he's going to be overthrown right Jehovah will die right that's all

01:41:26.699 --> 01:41:31.860
there is to it um and uh it's the feminine that brings

01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:36.900
him down right why do you think they're so afraid when a man is transformed into

01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:44.159
a woman using chemicals or surgery why do you think it's so disrupts the

01:41:44.159 --> 01:41:49.920
Christian and the Orthodox communities whether they be Jewish or

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:55.139
Christian Orthodox right why do you think it disrupts them so much because

01:41:55.139 --> 01:42:03.719
it's a manifestation of the power that they know can kill their God we we are the generation of Orion we are

01:42:03.719 --> 01:42:11.000
the god Killers how do we get them okay come interrupt sorry

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:17.219
Masonic traveling once more Greek he wants initiating he wants to read he wants to see the Greek the senior

01:42:17.219 --> 01:42:23.580
Gnostic conformance and he wants the Greek Administration through the Greek yeah

01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:30.000
he's asking who is the boy also and also there's more Snappy at 3 38 a.m which

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.280
good question I'd like if you can get that up for me can we talk about Saturn

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:40.560
Alias since it's almost the time of the festival what was happening with binding

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:48.239
and unbinding of the idol and the inversion of social hierarchies it's a good question and and I did I can't let

01:42:48.239 --> 01:42:53.400
it go because my bar doesn't work then I'm catching up I'm afraid

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:59.219
yeah Lord Lord's happy came last time and uh it's good to see

01:42:59.219 --> 01:43:05.639
you again um yeah it's the saturnalia is that golden age it's the it's the freeing

01:43:05.639 --> 01:43:10.679
it's the unconquerable or The Fearless freedom

01:43:10.679 --> 01:43:17.040
The Fearless Freedom you you reach that it's an age it's described as an age

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:23.100
right but we're talking outside of time um we're not talking about temporal ages

01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:30.420
right it's a power think of it as a power the imposition of another dimension and what it what does that

01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:36.560
Dimension represent it represents freedom so that slaves

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:42.960
become Masters right become the the I shouldn't say

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:49.139
um the inversion is to allow them to

01:43:49.139 --> 01:43:55.980
partake of uh the opposite pole so they don't do it just with slaves and Masters

01:43:55.980 --> 01:44:01.920
they do it with parents and children as well right so the children for saturnalia I

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:08.159
let my kids call the shots right um and and it's their choice and uh we

01:44:08.159 --> 01:44:14.280
follow their will and they guide they take over and and they guide

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:21.060
um so uh we masters of students the students take over

01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:26.460
right and when those students take over when that younger generation takes over

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:32.280
with its freedom you're um you're in a saturnian place

01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:40.080
or a satanic place that Row in that road disappears into the new I'm telling you

01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:47.179
it's a Mycenaean thing okay so Satan is not who you think his name is not even who you thought it was

01:44:47.179 --> 01:44:54.420
right it is Saturn so um and hey if there's if there's only

01:44:54.420 --> 01:45:05.579
one way to follow that we can do it through the drugs yeah so good Saturday fantastic uh uh there's a ton microbius

01:45:06.739 --> 01:45:11.820
whoever asked that question go resurrect macrobius

01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:18.600
and and ask him ask him specifically invoke The Muse and

01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:24.560
ask him to show you do it respectfully you can't come in without an

01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:30.239
unshaven right if you want to follow you have to sell everything you have give it

01:45:30.239 --> 01:45:37.260
to the poor and you have to commit right um because that's the way the mystery

01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:45.420
works yeah um Lord Snappy yeah good fantastic I think I don't want to

01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:52.440
