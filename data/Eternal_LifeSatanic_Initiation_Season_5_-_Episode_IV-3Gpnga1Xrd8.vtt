00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:08.040
copy here which is some reason

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:14.600
on the page previous give me just a second sorry that's poor preparation

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:22.019
my book fell apart though so I I have the page I'll just look at it here

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:28.500
um yeah Cronus I just want to read you something about Kronos what is these ithalis remember these are hymns and the

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:34.920
reason is so important for you to watch that video is the same reason when you walk into your church you understand and

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:41.459
he says before I have my long boring speech let me you guys go ahead and listen some music and get energized

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:49.019
right those images and the hymn that were transferring now those people are not under the influence of strong drugs

00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:54.420
and they're not in the sex orgy so the experience is going to be a little bit muted

00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:00.300
but let's read to him so you can see it Cronus what is these I thought he said

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:07.380
always fresh you know vigorous shoot he's that father of the great Gods and

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:13.678
Men he's that one who has such crafty advice so intelligent he's that strong

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:20.339
one he's that great Titan Titan what are the Titans the Titans are what was

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:27.199
before took over the Titans are what was before

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:35.640
everything that's ruling now is yes very confusing it's the older

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:41.100
generation and I'm I'm trying to be extremely specific with Titans because you'll have

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.260
people BSU talking about Nephilim and be

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:54.480
asked you about what these things are what these are Titans produce these Giants and what are Titans Rhea and

00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:00.240
Cronus are Titans Rey and Cronus or Titans what is the

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.640
this is the last one too I put this up on the my very last entry today

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.880
um yep go ahead that's yeah here is your verb right I told my Greek students

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.760
everybody don't forget all of Greek turns around its verb the verbs are the

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:26.760
engines that drive the language excellent so what I want you to do is what what is the Titan verb it's titano

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:32.760
which you can see is epic reduplicated for Taino and addictino will do right

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:41.580
but look what this means it's a stretch wait a minute read that Greek following stretcha Titan stretching that talkso

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:47.160
wait a minute do I do I have a bow I do have a bow this word's associated with

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.740
Boeing yes it is look at that look at the next line there's another bow reference and the line of that another

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:58.320
bow reference my goodness what other kind of references do we get we get the

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:07.280
harp we get the harp okay stop pull it down Chewie because you got to see the reality here it's that stretching action

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.940
it's that thing that brings that Bowman and that

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:19.020
musician into the same realm it's the tension

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:24.960
it's the tension of the cosmos those pre-socratic sitting around talking about tension nobody understands what

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:30.780
that means right it's the Attunement do you hear the atonement those of you

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:36.600
who who fancy the magic Arts it's particularly classical the real

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.940
stuff you guys you guys know what that means

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:50.760
what that tension is it's the power that drives everything and why are we talking like this Mr guy miss Mr Titan giant guy

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:56.400
sitting next to me talking to me tell me Mr Titan your children that are giants

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:03.120
what do they do they make lightning they make they make what they make lightning

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.220
okay now I'm in okay these people are cool no wonder people are afraid could

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:16.320
you tell me a little bit more about the lightning here give me the next boom let's just take the route let's

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:23.640
just take the root root of the oysters what is the oistress that is that sting

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:31.500
that is that sting it's also poison it's also the power

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:37.980
to put you into an oracular place and if you know Moses he likes his oracles

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:45.299

the Giza fragments right and so this is a copy of

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.220
um of the text and what I'm going to do is there are

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:20.820
two registers I'm going to use them both because I'm going to go from both translations just to get as well around

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:29.398

00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:00.800
perfect manifestation of nature

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:14.940
that foam from the water yes gorgeous oh I love it so much I just

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:20.400
want to put on I just want to play the rare for you um

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.440
I seem to have dropped my note my text where there it

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:31.320
is let me just read you a couple of things but um about Raya and while Chewie Regal

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:38.579
them a little bit with Raya um they don't need to watch the Greek the whole time yes

00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:47.119
um I'm gonna read the second half because it's in Greek yes so yeah she's that beautiful form right she is that

00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:56.220
incredible mate um of Cronus who rejoices and want she rejoices in

00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:04.020
the screams the hallelujahs the hallelujahs of Mortals in the mountains

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:10.380
she rejoices in that and there is both dark and light in that because that ola

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:18.599
luzo can be a shout of war and we know that Raya is full of this war

00:41:18.599 --> 00:41:24.839
that flow Brea is a flow that flow is full of this

00:41:24.839 --> 00:41:31.920
war full of it fantastic what else is she called sottera I don't know if you

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:38.339
noticed in the clip I'm gonna play it again because I want you to see the Titans and the Giants

00:41:38.339 --> 00:41:45.140
but that flow that Israel is called the savior

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:54.119
she is the savior why is Kronos important why is Saturn important

00:41:54.119 --> 00:42:01.079
because he responds to Reya and does what she says

00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:06.380
she is the one who has the power and what do they call her the Palm basilea

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:14.220
she who is the all Queen he's only a oneox Cronus is only a one ox

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:19.440
that's that Mycenaean King this is before anything Moses anything you can

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.900
possibly think from the from what you and I call the Bible

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:31.200
right this is before these are the Mycenaeans doing this

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:38.579
and there she is what a beautiful beautiful goddess image right that hits you right

00:42:38.579 --> 00:42:44.119
here like I said the Nazis are no match this tears through them all to the core

00:42:44.119 --> 00:42:49.619
love this and she is one that one who loves war and she is what the Savior and

00:42:49.619 --> 00:42:56.820
she is what the one who brings that cleansing of demons do you have demons today

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:02.280
do you have a little demon that needs to be cleansed I can cleanse your demon

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:08.160
I can cast out that Demon I've got a place for you to go to Cyprus

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:14.339
several thousand years ago and once you're there those demons can

00:43:14.339 --> 00:43:20.400
be drawn they can be drawn from you yeah

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:26.880
place of healing it's a hospital those clever Greeks we're building communal

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:33.420
hospitals places where they could purify their citizens isn't that nice

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:41.280
if you had a place like that we might have we might have a little bit more calm there may not be this electricity

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:47.119
in the air yes yes you have to bring that Mania

00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:52.619
that Madness in order to achieve that calm

00:43:52.619 --> 00:43:59.400
that calm fantastic and I just want to say um at the here near the end of the oath

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:04.920
uh near the end of the um him excuse me says she's a savior multiple times and

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:12.119
then it says remember this word savior is far before Christians are calling anybody's savior

00:44:12.119 --> 00:44:18.540
um what does she send on the whole on the entire Earth what does she send out Raya
