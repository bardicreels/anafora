and um with the Cavalry anyway Harry was a great guy quite a quite a uh quite a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.980
soldier quite a drinker ended up drunk in formation kicked out of his unit

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:29.160
um it the commanding officer of that unit was George Custer yes so he was

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.220
shipped West and ended up as a prison train guard um anyway about a decade later he

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.120
managed to guard this gentleman on the way from Arizona to Florida and it was

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.080
there that he realized the world was topsy-turvy that this was no

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.200
Criminal that he was with but was a great leader

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.420

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.780
his tobacco with him uh in order to bring him some sort of Honor in the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.640

eoboloi should be overcome in the bending

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:24.560
or if someone should take that hated potion of Black Death

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.259
you would prepare the cup equally

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.740

yes yes yes and

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.639

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.880
to the bed of Love most willingly

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.759

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.440
of the yellow is to consume this potion

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:55.620

harbors yeah yeah and um so who are these

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:28.800
I want you to consider who are these people who would be doing this who in their right mind

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.979
um which cult members would be doing this right this is part of the initiation so these eoboloi are those

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:41.100
literally who carry the EOS or who throw it's it's really throwing the idea is

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.940
projectile to throw it so we're thinking arrows yes yes we're thinking arrows

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:54.060
let's go to eobolos when we get a chance we're thinking arrows and we're thinking poisons

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:01.400
and we're thanking those who are using them right look at this entry

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.199
yobolos shooting arrows isn't that nice and notice the Little Greek word talks

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:13.919
on that was Alice by the way let's keep Alice up there for a minute not a civil war talks on right that's a bow or an

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:20.759
arrow or a bow and arrow um or an English a toxin yes same root

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:28.620
right same route why because these are poison arrow wielding people

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:36.440
and these people are active in the use of a whole bunch of different drugs

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:43.560
meant to induce something called oysters oyster Mania the thing that the person

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.599
gets who is stung s

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:53.880
yes yes okay as we're reading this I want uh we're going to continue but I

00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.599
want you to look at um let's let's finish eobolos throw eobolos up there again let's get that yes shedding Venom

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:06.900
venomous of animals right of animals um look down at the last one number two

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:14.940
it says of arrows poisoned and it gives you the orphic hymn 12 lines 16 12 lines

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:21.840
16. can we go to that we have that yes let's go to that that one the orphic

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:28.560
the next passage yes good good good good good and what who is this orphic hymn to

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:36.060
the orphic hymn is to Heracles he's not who you think you um you've been living

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:44.099
in a fairy tale world I love doing this I absolutely love doing this you've been living in a fairy tale world right

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:52.380
um yes now who is the real Heracles whoo yeah quite a different fellow

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:59.820
quite a different fellow let's just look at this one line yes look at this ah what does he do he

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:05.000
sends out the command here at the end is to send out his

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.880
kalapas his curies um what are curies curies are the death

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:18.480
spirits that come for you in your Justified right moment usually they're

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:25.320
depicted in a Battlefield where the Ares is that repelling force

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:31.320
of War they're usually there and you know different cultures pick these up in different ways but they're the spirits

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:37.560
that go along and harvest they rip the soul from the body

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:45.060
isn't that nice anyway that's what Heracles sends and how does it say he sends it there says he sends it with his

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.580
arrows with his arrows his flying go back please

00:09:50.580 --> 00:10:00.300
yes with his flying eoboloy his flying yobiloy yes the delivery mechanism of

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:06.560
his EOS bring us up the EOS please chewy

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:12.660
next definition that we're getting to down here maybe there we go EOS take a

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.700
look at this EOS in one case it's an arrow notice that the bottom good arrow

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:23.580
and then let's go to the next EOS oh look at this poison as of serpents

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:29.580
poison as of serpents that's the base of everything that they're talking about

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:38.640
with this um communion toxin right it's an arrow toxin that they're using so again get

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:46.200
your bearings know where we are you can kind of see the people around us dancing you know who they are okay let's go back

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:53.820
to I'm going to read you a couple of things from that translation again if one of these guys from the eoboloi right

00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:00.959
one of these poison throwers um by the way it's also an apathet um Artemis

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:06.060
is called E okay Ira e okay Ira she who

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:12.420
dispenses the EOS

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:18.959
isn't that nice and that's why she's a Huntress and a midwife a Huntress and a

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:24.899
midwife it's the poison that connects both of those things because she's using

00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:32.360
the poison in her hunting and in her Midwifery isn't that great isn't that great

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.459
if one of these yoboloi should be overcome and the bending

00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:43.500
yeah and should take or should take if somebody should take the Poma of the

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:52.440
black death now realize that is a specific medicine slash communion drink

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:58.019
the the poem is like the sacred drink this

00:11:58.019 --> 00:12:04.519
is the communion right it's the prepared cup that you're taking potion old old

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:11.940
word you can translate it as potion but then you start to sound like we're drifting into uh you know

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:18.300
something extremely modern yeah um it's the potion of

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:26.220
cyanic death interesting that they would call it the um so then you would prepare he says you

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:32.040
would prepare the cup right that and you do it um through the transition it's

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:37.980
strange but you do it through the transition from that dark night

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:43.519
to the dawn because that's what we're doing here is we are bringing the dawn

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:50.700
back to the person who has entered into the death this is good cult stuff I mean

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:57.420
come on this uh yeah wow um yeah people might want to tell you

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:04.560
things about ancient Cults it's never worth it go to the cult itself watch how

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:11.040
they're interacting remember this is Nero by the way for those of you who are asking the question what does this have

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.440
to do with the Bible right the person who is reading this who it's addressed

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:24.180
to that person is the person who beheaded another cult leader

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:30.000
yeah very popular cult leader whose influence became

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.839
a profound impact so you've been reading the fairy tale now we've landed in the

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:43.980
history and you can see oh wait a minute the dude will be headed the other dude what are the drugs that he was into

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:50.940
right what are the drugs what's going on right why is he all the way back in Rome

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:57.420
this is fantastic yeah so you prepare that cup um for the one overcome right you set

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:05.940
out that kylex you set out that cup you prepare it for the one damn noise

00:14:06.139 --> 00:14:13.139
that comes from tomato or demao or dumb now that that one too

00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:21.720
they're often the same root it's the Delta Mu and it means to be subdued by something to be overcome

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:27.600
when you're in that potion you were overcome by that Force and do you know

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:34.040
who you use in that place you use

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:44.579
oh who is he like remember we're plugged in with the analog type who is Dom nomineeus he's

00:14:44.579 --> 00:14:51.480
the one who emerged when Rhea the flow

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:58.699
the pair of Chronos when Reya reached into the Earth

00:14:58.699 --> 00:15:06.680
as she was giving birth and clenched the ground in her hands

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:12.720
came forward okay that's nice that's nice

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:18.420
um I'll show you the magic words at the end but I will not give you their meaning

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:23.940
um yes you have to you have to derive that on your own

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:29.699
um which you will let's do that though um let's go forward so I wanted you to

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:35.220
see that passage of uh you know what is

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:42.120
um and by the way they're leading him to the bed right they're leading the initiate to the bed

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.940
and there's a lot about chafing earlier on there's a section about chafing and

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:55.800
about penile problems and about it's all very osirian if you've listened to it

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.620
it's like being I'll describe it this way as I'm sitting there reading it and

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:07.199
having said that guys we've got to step back for a second say this document that

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:15.540
Nero has managed to get his grubby hands on this document preserves a very very

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:23.040
very beautiful art um it is using Expressions that are also

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:31.079
used technical terms that are used by the famous priest nakander even Cicero

00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:39.360
um had read in the Candor right and the Candor is a priest of Apollo you like this Clary and Apollo the god

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:45.180
of the oracle this is who he is and he's writing to a friend of his in one of his

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:51.480
Works who happens to be the priest of Reya civilly

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:57.839
performing the rights of Addis and they're um he's composed a song The canners

00:16:57.839 --> 00:17:05.280
composed a song for this guy and it has to do with guess what the the drugs the

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:12.418
drugs within the right and um the poisons and everything

00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:18.600
um Immaculate it's it's gorgeous let's go to a little nikander let's bring him up shall we some nikander give me that

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.938
in the Candor text yeah oh look at this look at this

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:33.120
um this is yeah this is Nikita I just want you to read from hate at the end of the line like when the bakans boasts and

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:39.440
um shout shout out shout out what the Orcs and mouse that song that they have

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:45.679
that song that they have bring it back up please good good and they are what look at the last word in that line

00:17:45.679 --> 00:17:54.240
oysteroi what are they Under the Influence they're under the influence of that that ostrich that holds its head

00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:02.039
back isn't that descriptive oh he's the one who said nikander said

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:07.740
you gotta watch the fire of Medea that stuff will kill you

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:16.020
yeah anyway good stuff I love it I love it there's one more in the Candor can we go to the next passage maybe yes yes

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:22.440
um here I put the uh this is the great translation for anybody who doesn't uh

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:30.059
have nakander is gallon showfield did a fantastic leave it up did a fantastic

00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:35.280
um translation to the best of their ability look a lot of the plants and stuff not so good right because it's

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:42.419
vague right but and they're using a Priestly language so it's a little bit you know in times of borders and kind of

00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:48.059
insanity what did he say that anyway um look at this let not the evil ferment of

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:55.140
the Soul injure of man it will often swell up in his chest at other times it will choke him when it is

00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:01.620
fostered over the Viper's coil deep in its lair sucking up the monster's venom and the

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:08.220
noxious breath from its mouth this is the evil ferment which they call fungi

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:15.960
in general for to different kinds different names have been assigned so you know what that

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:21.960
mushroom is and you know that that mushroom

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:28.380
um is especially grown to take in the

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:35.340
influence of the Viper that ferment

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:43.799
that ferment um is what that mushroom is yes

00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:48.840
right look at this look at the Greek it's beautiful it's mama

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:54.780
right the ferment uh and this is why now all of a sudden it makes sense to you

00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:00.179
all right okay first let's finish the picture you see you're watching the Vipers they're crawling around doing

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:08.160
their thing and their dens and these mushrooms are there the mushrooms are absorbing those toxins they're absorbing

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:15.480
that breath that vitality all right that comes through the Viper

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.820
for those of you with ears to hear you'll hear and now as you wake up you

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:29.640
know why Jesus said watch out for the manna right watch out for that fermentation

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:35.460
that fermentation the fermentation of the

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:40.620
Pharisees yeah the fermentation of Pharisees now I

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:48.660
know I call them Generation of Vipers right it's we're working under the same system right Jesus is no dummy he's

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:54.720
picked up the right he's picked up the influence from uh nikander I forgot to

00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:01.320
tell you is like second century BC second century BC and is so popular

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:06.900
Everybody by first century when Jesus and his crew are out everybody there is

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:13.620
he's in the atmosphere right one of the few that is and it works

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:18.660
really um or had a huge effect there's a lot of Byzantine work done specifically

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:25.620
on the Candor right um most classical Scholars avoid him like the plague

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:31.860
um because his Greek is impenetrable

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:37.440
Yes you heard me his Greg is impenetrable if you want it next time

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.600
somebody boasts to you that they can show you great flash up the very first

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.640
thing that we uh um our bit from Nero today that we had just flashed that up

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:54.000
he won't be able to translate I guarantee you I guarantee you people and you and let me tell you why because in

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.860
that passage our hopox lagoma words that only appear here right

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:06.840
so we have problems we have problems in translating this stuff what do we do we

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:12.840
do what the victorians did we run back to hisekius we resurrect this guy from

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:18.299
the fifth century fourth and fifth centuries we resurrect him we said tell

00:22:18.299 --> 00:22:24.179
us what these words mean and we go back to Aisa and we look at ISA and we see

00:22:24.179 --> 00:22:31.320
what she we see what she what she says can we have the next reading we need to proceed we have eight nine more minutes

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:37.260
until we self-destruct yes one of those sure let's go

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:44.280
um I want you to look at damadzo just to be overcome to be overcome look at

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.380
um I want the second one here just take a look at the number three of the powers

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:55.679
of nature to overpower Dom nomineeus baby dominaus

00:22:55.679 --> 00:23:02.400
okay keep going this is this is real you know we are we are at the

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:08.880
um place where the magician comes into being I mean we're with the dactyls

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:14.880
we're with the dactyls this is good good old magic this is Mycenaean stuff right

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:21.480
this is snake goddess Ville we love this okay let's get another reading up here

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:28.140
um yes oh why not let's go ahead and throw up the ephesia gromita right the

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:36.919
Ephesian words right um these were written well they're written in a lot of places in antiquity

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:42.240
um you can look it up and find yourself a list of what sources we have to have them

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:48.960
um but you you really want to talk about the Temple of Artemis right at Ephesus

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:54.240
where this cult seems to be coming from these words are words and of course they

00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:01.520
have this wonderful library look at this wonderful library right this is coming from the Cults that you and I are

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:08.940
worshiping you and I are working with now right this libraries

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:14.700
that's where it's coming from Pythagoras says that right um if you want to found a city you

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:22.380
should build a temple of the news right start you start with your Museum anyway let's put up the Ephesian letters

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:29.700
and what people have traditionally said about these is that

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.919
these writings is that it reflects an older language is it Greek well it's

00:24:34.919 --> 00:24:42.120
expressed in Greek yes yes nope the very last let's go to the very Ephesian

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.100
letters here at the end there we go

00:24:47.179 --> 00:24:56.780
okay and um look it's expressed in Greek you can see it in Greek ascion kataskion

00:24:57.919 --> 00:25:04.559
leaksion or I see it now if you don't know if you don't know what any of these

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:11.100
words mean um you're at a loss what they're used for is to prevent

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:19.260
to prevent any sort of activity um Quantum activity if you will that

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:24.840
would be an attack upon oneself it's a defensive measure

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:31.140
um uh report supposedly uh you know there are people famous people trying to take

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:37.200
it away who use them right um Marcus Aurelius being one of them but whatever

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.419
um yeah so what do they have to do what do they have to let's see what people

00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:49.559
have traditionally made of them pull that up yes askion and uh they say perhaps has

00:25:49.559 --> 00:25:56.580
something or ancient sources something to do with shade perhaps please leave that up thank you and um leaks yeah what

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:01.919
is the leaks if you look this one up in hesitius you can find out what it means

00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:08.100
and um it'll be part of a piece of the puzzle for you to put together

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:14.400
um he'll tell you about the plagios right anyway um Tex rocks tetrocks right is that the

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:21.179
four cornering is that the um Four Seasons are we getting into the Ori well what

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:28.320
about the next name yeah right dumb nominees now the I see

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:36.900
on and I see her right he's the power by the way the damn Domino's is the one who is performing the initiation he's the

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:43.260
one who's going through the actual right right it's the diamond in the individual

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:50.039
becoming one right it's an act of possession it's an act of possession

00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:55.200
um but if you look at I see on right and I see ya

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.720
right and you'll notice that we have for the first time a very good example of

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:06.840
insertion with c as in C boule um right in the middle of the word to

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:13.320
interrupt the flow and this is something you're going to catch over and over again in the PGM that they're doing they

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:20.220
play with syllables they reverse them they turn them around um they'll take half of one and make an

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:26.580
insertion like we just saw and those are the operating those words that they're doing that with

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:32.039
are the operators look through the PGM the Spells and you'll see that there are

00:27:32.039 --> 00:27:39.779
specific operating words so that is a an incantation that was popular in

00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:46.860
Antiquity if you could perform it properly if you could perform it properly

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:54.900
um and it had to be repeated in a very specific way so the The Voice could

00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:00.059
access that invisible Dimension around you know it's

00:28:00.059 --> 00:28:07.260
like um using that voice creates visibility yeah yeah so

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:13.440
um yeah fantastic uh the sex part you promised the sex right

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:23.760
um you'd notice that they were leading the gentleman to the bed to the bed and he um the the person who

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:30.539
is being initiated engages in a sexual activity at a specific time

00:28:30.539 --> 00:28:39.779
under the influence of specific drugs so as detectives we're one step closer

00:28:39.779 --> 00:28:47.100
if we just step back um and look at the crime scene right the mob is there they're all

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:53.279
yelling out kill him right you got a whole group of people just pissed saying

00:28:53.279 --> 00:29:04.080
kill him he's arrested in a public park at 4am with in the com company of a naked boy

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:14.059
um and the naked boy has what is arguably a medicated bandage used in cult right

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:21.320
involving the making of a cup yeah

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:27.000
yeah and the consumption so we have to stand back when I say okay I know that

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.659
within these rights we have other examples of people who are engaged we the Greek word there was coitus you know

00:29:33.659 --> 00:29:38.779
we get coitus from it um so

00:29:38.779 --> 00:29:44.120
we now have your honor we now have a

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:52.140
motive here we have other contemporary Cults that are doing the same acts that

00:29:52.140 --> 00:30:00.179
are involved in drug-induced ritual that is sexual in nature so this

00:30:00.179 --> 00:30:05.940
is where now you see why the London Times said this area is the last Wild

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:11.039
Frontier of classics right um

00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:18.360
it it's truly an open field the fact that nobody is working on this is only a

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:24.779
Frac is only a caused by our own societos um

00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:30.899
laziness you know people don't want to study these texts because it's hard it's hard you give that sheet to any

00:30:30.899 --> 00:30:38.460
Professor any Professor who claims to be especially one of these religious historians give them that and say okay

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:44.880
smarty who says they translate great translate this yeah you watch what happens because some

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.919
of the words are some of the words are rooted in Traditions that they don't

00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:57.299
follow if you want to know the good stuff um you gotta drink the fire you know

00:30:57.299 --> 00:31:04.260
what I mean you gotta go deep and you gotta see you got to see what's going on okay thank you very much now we're going

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:10.140
to turn to Rob who is going to rob tell me something I wanna I wanna put this

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:15.419
quote up on the screen and I want people to see and I want you to tell me a

00:31:15.419 --> 00:31:22.140
little bit if you can about the gentleman um that we're we're putting up here yeah

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:28.020
um I would like to write a book which would drive men mad which would be like an Open Door leading them where they

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:33.720
would never have consented to go in short a door that opens into onto

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:40.500
reality thank you Mr arto Right um tell do you do you want add us

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:46.860
something if if you could resurrect this man from the grave would there would he have anything interesting to say

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:52.620
relevant oh yeah interesting unrelevant yeah well it's a

00:31:52.620 --> 00:32:00.779
story and it's um it's a very interesting story that goes back uh he's an ancestor to some degree I

00:32:00.779 --> 00:32:06.419
don't know what degree he's an ancestor but to some degree he is and uh we were

00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:12.360
talking about him last night and you've you've really got me going into the

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:18.600
research and I've got start at the beginning I've got to go back to the beginning and I've got to go to the

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:24.059
Discord a Discord that's happening

00:32:24.059 --> 00:32:30.779
on the beaches of Troy I want to take you back to the beaches of Troy where there's a Discord going on

00:32:30.779 --> 00:32:36.659
between agamemon and achilles there's prizes that have

00:32:36.659 --> 00:32:43.020
been distributed and there's there's a plague you mentioned the plague

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:50.220
recently and there's a plague going on and they're trying to appease the plague

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:55.679
Apollo sent the plague and um the try to appease it and prizes have got to go

00:32:55.679 --> 00:33:01.380
back and prizes are getting mixed up and distributed about and achilles isn't happy

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:06.500
Achilles is just about to draw his sword

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:13.440
and agamemon is has been disgraceful towards him and he

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:19.919
feels it so he's about to draw his sword and down comes Athena and we all love

00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:26.519
Athena you know she's even Achilles loves Athena he listens to it she comes

00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:32.419
down and she she stops him she stops his she checks his rage

00:33:32.419 --> 00:33:38.100
and she's probably the only person Achilles would listen to so he listens

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:45.059
to it and he checks his rage and he leaves and he walks away he walks away from

00:33:45.059 --> 00:33:52.080
the problems he's having um he makes his way to a beach he loses his prize and he makes his away

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:58.980
makes his way to a beach and he sits on the beach and

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:04.440
he's looking at the Gracie and that's all that's all he's doing

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:10.500
so I get to this point with Homer in the beginning of the early

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:17.040
art and I'm thinking can I introduce hero

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:24.599
colitis would I be able to introduce him and um because he's a miserable shot Harry

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:31.020
client he says you know it it doesn't um it doesn't mix well it does it doesn't

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:36.240
go get go into town that often he takes himself off and he

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:41.940
likes to take himself off and achilles just took himself off so I'm thinking maybe

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:48.540
we've got this tire machine and I can I can move out of colitis next to

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:54.240
Achilles for give him a bit of advice Maybe this guy is a

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:59.280
there's a hell of a philosophy uh not much of Hope man if

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:07.440
if you know you're having classes they thought Homer should have been clubbed and thrown out but here we are and I

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:14.040
want to sit with Eric era closes to sit where the kill is and if chewy you can

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:19.579
bring up me first my first image please

00:35:19.579 --> 00:35:24.780
we're not prepared on this end with the images do you have uh here we'll search

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:31.140
for him you get you uh you keep going with narrative okay well I'll just come with the quote then we've got we've got

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:37.980
a quote from heraclitis and the quotas what opposes unites

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:45.119
and the finest achievement stems from things bearing in opposite directions

00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:50.940
and all things come about by strife and uh

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:56.640
I'm going to read this again a water poses unites and the finest

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:02.220
Attunement stems from things bearing in opposite directions

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:09.060
and all things come about by strife and I think Achilles listened to this

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:15.780
point and so we moved into peer gauge now I've got

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:21.599
little things all littered around my screen here and it all stems in one question

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:28.380
I've got one question for the gallery out there and anyone who's interested in

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:35.640
almonds work and interested in getting involved anything I kind of got an example of how

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:42.180
fascinating these things can be and how they can work they're they're incredible the they

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:48.119
showed the question is how do we get from the marquish desard

00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:53.579
to the center of the universe and I've got this littered all around

00:36:53.579 --> 00:37:01.560
everywhere and I think what I've been given is a merit of shorts It's a gentleman

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:06.839
I'd like you to look into and you've seen his quote at the beginning

00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:13.020
but we're looking for recognitions I'm looking for recognitions and unless and

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:20.240
recognitions of herself the entire subjects everything

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.980
um you've been asking for a spell you've been asking for magic and I bought you

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:32.280
something else we're going to have a look at it we're going to have a look at this spell tonight and it's dark it's

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:37.680
extremely dark uh if you thought Marcus The Shard was bad then

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:44.400
get ready for this one ah so what can you tell us rather about

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:50.660
the Asylum what is the um is there a benefit

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:55.800
because both the ghosts that you're that you are

00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:00.839
um bringing together here two two of the several that you're bringing together

00:38:00.839 --> 00:38:07.980
um brilliantly is uh they were in insane asylums um the Marquee was an insane asylum

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:13.920
correct and um correct me if I'm wrong but was artel as well correct 10 years

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:21.839
10 years and then even then even in care when is a group of friends helped get

00:38:21.839 --> 00:38:28.140
him out got him out of this island he was in that's where we'll go to the Ville de

taking a quite a hit in his life basically because he didn't have the finances to keep himself out of a

00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:47.760
lunatic asylum so then he was put in a lunatic asylum by decree

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:54.359
that's where he's gone and the uh the friends decided they went and

00:40:54.359 --> 00:41:00.000

is trying to get across so how do I get from a death threat spell

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:50.160
for what is all intents and purposes the work of a man locked away in a lunatic asylum

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:56.480
it's poverty stricken he's addicted to opium his destitute

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:01.680
and he's had all this he's had all this treatment what's ruined him completely

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:10.500
ruined him how do we get from that death threat to something good

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:16.380
in this gentleman I I how do we uh why am I presenting this guy why would I

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:22.560
present this guy to you who's writing death threats and why why why would we be interested in

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:28.940
this Jack then you've got to ask the same question of all the intellectuals around in

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:34.800
France of his day of his day these intellectuals got together

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:40.680
and the um meditation Picasso among other artists

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:49.440
sold Works sold parts of their works there's a is a fund for him and he put a

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:55.079
benefit on for him at the share of being hard Center and

00:45:55.079 --> 00:46:00.359
all these all these intellectuals of the day came out and they read actually oops

00:46:00.359 --> 00:46:06.359
from his work and celebrated him and he is celebrated

00:46:06.359 --> 00:46:12.540
in France right now and he's honed off essentially I've never heard of him

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:17.819
and the only reason I did hear of him is because of that last name

00:46:17.819 --> 00:46:24.300
Auto and uh I've got I've got a relative he was an auto I've

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:30.900
got a great great Granddad he was a french guy who came over from France as a master builder

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:37.440
he had no money either but he came over as a master builder and made made his way and

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:44.160
I have no idea what the link is there but it seems like when I've looked through this chapter artwork and I've

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:50.040
looked through this Chap's interests and have a look through his images and I've

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:55.800
seen quite a few recognitions and as I say at the beginning they were looking for

00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:01.500
recognitions I want people to recognize these things such as how how we treat

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:08.300
these people yeah and that recognition that that

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:14.220
was disgraceful it's absolutely disgraceful we you know come on you

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:19.560
could be treated the shame and you've you've had comments on on the YouTube you've had

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:26.940
comments on the Discord and dealt with will be dealt with and you know but but they come through in

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:32.520
the disgusting these things are they're disgusting now the way they can treat people and in

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:38.339
another day day and another time we'd be burnt I'd have been I'd big bands for

00:47:38.339 --> 00:47:43.920
reading out to spell I I was actually was just this this guy

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:50.280
was an atheist he was a complete atheist and he was very very intelligent and he

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:56.520
knows his stuff you can tell in all his quotes you can tell in all the markers you look for

00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:02.160
you know as I say he's took me to

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:08.040
he's took me to the to the to the battle yes the there's a there's a word that I

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:13.560
want to share and it's battle and I'm gonna cut off there I'm not

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:21.300
because because this is a long thing this is this isn't gonna just end end today with one presentation or one

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:26.940
conversation about it this is a long conversation this guy is well read well

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:31.980
studied and in all the things we're becoming well read and well studied then

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:37.099
so it seems and I think he's got a lot to offer us

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:46.500
that France um um puts it those who are inspired by The

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:52.260
Muse into into insane asylums is that a uh is that a

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:57.660
bigger statement on life what do we leave with that this is Mr Rogers which

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:04.560
it isn't but if it were um what would that leave us with you you gave me two gentlemen who were put into

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:11.220
Geniuses that were put into into insane asylums are is it is that because the

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:17.880
physics of the universe just doesn't is that just what it bends toward is that is that the bending we all have to

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:24.720
become lunatics and throw our heads back and become bakkens so they can put us away is that where you're going with all

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:31.920
of this now where I'm going with all letters the Ancients knew better didn't they the

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:37.920
Ancients knew better than they didn't have lunatic asylums did they We're The Lunatic asylums

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:45.119
come on can you answer that no no lunatic asylums you're really talking

00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:51.060

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:57.200
homeless people that hang out at the cemetery right those are your lunatic asylums

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:03.900

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:09.420
there are some in the palace there's some lunatics yes yes or all the

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:14.579

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:36.300

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:44.400
where the bean and what I've been up to and how this subject can affect just a normal

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:50.099
