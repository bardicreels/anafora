00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.160
was right and this was a way Emmanuela was just a

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.520
way for the for the great father

didn't have they couldn't hold a candle those victorians to you guys

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:13.580

to see at the the order tonight I need to see

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:10.320
um our chief bio engineer I need him to report on Project Medusa please if you

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:18.600
can do that I know it's last minute but we need to bring this you know secret stuff in good fantastic

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:25.440

yes we have time it's it all has to do with with stereoscopy and you know

00:27:56.659 --> 00:28:02.460
some some quantum physics that I'm not sure that I want to even start to try to

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:07.919
understand but I wanted to take you to

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:13.158

the variations of the ion

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:46.400
she's one she is bending back the various possibilities of the ions

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:53.880
mixing things future with things past

00:28:53.880 --> 00:29:00.299

going on there in that cave what exactly is she doing what exactly is she doing and how do we

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:26.700

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:39.360
they want that Medusa to the guys who couldn't get there

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:48.020
because they went wrong they didn't pay attention to Bull or Lawton to the guys who couldn't get there

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:54.140
because they took a wrong direction the Aryan Queen

00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:01.980
