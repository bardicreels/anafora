00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.079
you and bring it right to you tonight we're going to be able to ask some hard-hitting questions starting with

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.460
round one tonight we're gonna move forward into that new discovery that new

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.680
Bronze Age Discovery and we're going to look at the specific drug

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.200
the compound is so important it's going to lead us along the path of the mystery

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.438
tonight season four begins lady Babylon

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:39.199
[Music]

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.380
tonight's subject of medicinal Madness is brought to you by necessity in the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.680
present we're going to look at these drugs we're going to look at the combos that they're using we're going to look

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.200
at the people who are using them we're going to ask why and tonight we get to drop into a very

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.299
sleepy place a place where we can

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.760
breach all of those bounds that we don't normally breach we can bring forward

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.599
in that religious ecstasy we can bring forward that music I think we have an

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.620
example of some musical ecstasy um can you hit a Chewie

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.690
[Music]

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.819
foreign

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.780
can we pull up the headline yeah this is just something to pull out of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.420
the present right something just to Anchor us here yeah woman has loud and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.780
full body orgasm during la Philharmonic concert

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.540
so what is that old Association tonight we're the reason that we have to come

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:14.519
through this appearance of the orgasm or the orgasmos in Greek that orge root

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:21.360
we're coming to the orgia we're coming to the place where we bring out the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.659
bakic voice where we bring that out right and in order to get there we have

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:33.599
to Anchor ourselves with you know why why are we doing this

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:40.620
the drugs that were in that Bronze Age hair that constellation of drugs

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.900
are Tangled within a right that involves

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.120
sexuality it involves the individual coming to the point

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.200
of the what you and I would call the orgasm under the influence and if that

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.720
individual does not have within themselves that milk of calm if they do

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.680
not have that milk of calm they won't be coming back so this is uh the knowledge here is

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.919
fantastic the the capability of these Bronze Age priestesses pharmacologically

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.160
is considerable so tonight I want to look at Mandrake but before we do I want

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.639
to put everything within context and the reason that we're here in season four is

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:37.259
we are hunting we are hunting for the mystery we are putting Jesus within the

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:43.199
evidence we're looking at the evidence of what we have so that we can say what

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:49.919
was that naked kid doing with Jesus now I've been asking that question for

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.460
several years what was that naked kid doing with Jesus and I can tell you that

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:04.139
from the different types of response that I've the responses that I've gotten from the academic Community

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:10.639
um by and large overwhelmingly it is is fearful

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:20.340
people don't want to talk about it so tonight I thought we'd nail down Jesus and see what he thinks

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.960
Chewie roll that it's me everybody's favorite Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.060
and uh I just wanted to take a short break from my very busy schedule of

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.160
you know the Miracles and of course other really important Jesus duties up here so that I could uh

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.520
little divine intervention with you let's see you've got a question for me here let's uh let's read it I have just

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.900
one very important question uh what were you doing with that naked kid with whom you're arrested with at

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.540
4am in the public park oh uh yeah you're referring to Mark 14 51.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:04.010
[Music] I was sharing the gospel

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.740

I agree with 80 percent of you Ace looks guilty doesn't it he looks

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.979
really guilty um credits credits to Jesus for

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:06.900
answering and for understanding that the cost of such things of his

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:14.340
ability to speak shouldn't be more than forty dollars yeah yeah

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.880
thank you Jesus for your response at least Jesus

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.300
had the guts to stand there and to look Us in the eye and to give us

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:33.240
an answer the majority of people that you encounter that you

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:40.139
ask him this question what what kind of answers will they give you we're overheating here what kind of

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:47.099
answers will they give you yeah you'll be shocked at what you get you'll

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:52.680
see the person come right up come right out from that proposition we

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:59.639
don't care do we no we are here because we want to get to the real we want to get to the bottom we don't care about

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:05.699
what theories are and I want to re-emphasize that this season we don't care what your theories are we don't

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:13.500
care what books you write we don't care what classes you teach we don't care what you're selling

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:19.699
um we're here to find out what that Crystal Clear

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:24.960
reality tastes like yeah we're here for that Spring right you guys are all

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:31.020
devotees of the muse we don't care that Harvard and Yale have dropped the ball and Princeton has shot

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:38.700
its own brains out we don't care we don't care they academically committed suicide we don't care we don't

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:44.099
care that Harvard and Yale and every other Ivory Tower Association on the

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:50.220
planet is scrambling to figure out where they went wrong we don't care ours is

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:58.500
the evidence this is the museum we have the sources we have the text let's jump into one tonight this is our

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:05.580
first I just want to give you the first Greek text that I've got up here for yes beautiful thank you yeah I'm just going

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.800
to give you a little bit of diascores a little bit of diascortis and this time I'm going to do a little bit differently

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.899
I'm going to let you see the text I'm going to flash it up here and I'm going to tell you that we're going to be

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:21.300
looking at Mandrake we're going to be looking at Mandrake and then I want to put the uh take go ahead and take the

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:28.080
text down and now I'm going to read it to you for those of you who do such things you pause it there and you can go

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:34.500
back over the Greek but for those of you who say I'm not into the Greek but I want to hear what this has to say for

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:40.279
you we take that down yeah I want to read to you about

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:46.140
Mandrake we call this planet he says

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:55.640
the cerseian the cerseien and when he says that right away we all run

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.380
we all run to the folks at the University and we tell them this is a

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:09.480
compound a polythonic compound that is called by the name

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:16.500
that you can then piece together all of its component parts to restore it to

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.899
make it one it's the cerseian the sirsin okay what is this cerseian thing this is

00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:26.940
what they're looking for in Spain right it's what they've got in their hair

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:36.120
it's what they've got in their hair okay so let's look at one of the constituents of the cerseien compound it is this

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:42.360
Mandrake the root of mandrake and when I say Cersei and I want you to remember I

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:52.560
want you to remember that we are talking about late Bronze Age monarchies that are ruled by women who

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:59.640
have extra specialized knowledge that knowledge is being used militarily it's

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:05.940
being used um medicinally and it is being used

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:13.079
um in a very destructive way as well as a very positive way too you could say it was their artificial intelligence right

00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:22.200
it was that burst that fluorescence and there are people who are known to be the

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.019
pioneers of these fields foreign

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:36.860
you might be surprised to find out but Pythagoras calls this combination

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:45.480
his oracular Prophet give me some profit I need the profit so strangely enough

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:51.540
though this Prophet is a romantic a Mantic prophet

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:57.920
yes and this Prophet gives you the future

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:05.040
through Insanity through lunacy through Mania

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:14.480
through Mania now here's the thing though for those of you who need it this drug can cure that violent

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.980
wrathful Fierce impulse yes fantastic that's how it's being used

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:26.700
medically that's how the doctors use apparently very good stabilize your brain yes

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:32.820
um they're inducing a state they're inducing State let's see what else he says about this drug you're going to be

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:41.220
surprised you're going to be surprised so this is one of the cerseian elements one of the cerseian elements and um what

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:47.160
are we what do we know about this sirsian element well we know the Egyptians call it blah blah blah you

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:53.180
know we've got all these different regions but Pythagoras calls the Mandrake this is little his little

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.380
anthropomorph yeah isn't that nice isn't that nice throw up give that give a man

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:04.380
drink up there let people see the creepy root um yes and

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:12.240
notice that uh this old drug this old drug even the zoroastrians he says call

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.339
it this original or prime communion

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:25.800
this Prime communion the Romans have their names for it right and some people call it the

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:33.180
the penis of Typhon some people call it penis Typhon we know

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:40.440
we know that the people that are involved we have these baskets yes these baskets with these dildos and it only

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:46.139
makes sense that this medicated dildo that we're using to administer this drug

00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:52.680
remember guys that we're not you're not in Kansas anymore I forgot to tell you the ship we're already there

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.899
um you've got to realize that this is coming from the worship of the great

00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:03.860
mother who is actively involved in the sexual

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.880
maturation of what you and I would call a child

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:15.899
yes so already we're in a foreign World we're in a foreign World we're gonna have to get up sniff that air and we're

00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:23.399
gonna say okay this isn't this isn't what I want right this isn't what I want it's culturally this is but it's there

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:28.620
so we're gonna have to deal with it we're gonna have to see um the right

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:36.540
as it was in the real yes good good good so Pythagoras

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:43.079
is steeped in the use of this inducing drug and remember it is only

00:14:43.079 --> 00:14:49.500
the it is only the me Nads who end up bringing

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:56.279
through the ah euphonia you say what yeah it turns out if you

00:14:56.279 --> 00:15:03.240
take this drug turns out if you take this drug tells you that it can put you into a

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.820
place of where you're off onus yes and what does that mean it means

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:14.339
literally without a voice he's literally without a voice but it is

00:15:14.339 --> 00:15:22.560
a word used of the tragic chorus it is a dropping a roughening a

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:29.459
harshening of The Voice chemically chemically in other words we're inducing

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:37.620
a Mania a psychosis we'll show you the drugs in a minute but we're you're inducing a psychosis with these things

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:44.940
that involves a Visionary state that is complete horror

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:51.720
and you say why would you want to do that and they say well in Antiquity the doctor said well it helps with the aggression problem

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:57.540
yeah it helps with the aggression bro you put somebody through this initiation and

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:03.959
you bring them out securely you know it's part of their health they

00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:10.459
didn't say mental health but it's a way of casting out the demons

00:16:10.459 --> 00:16:16.320
fantastic you can see you can see the the health is there okay so here we are

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:24.300
with the Mandrake and he says it's very useful it's very useful the the root and its juice are very useful in the filtron

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:30.660
in the field Throne I think I've got the Greek let's just go through some of these forms of the Greek up here we'll

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:37.440
start up here um this is the type of power that you're dealing with the karate course isn't

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:45.300
that nice the stupifying and the karate koi are a whole or a whole group of

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:51.959
powers right of drugs good let's go to the next one yeah look at oh this is you know

00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:57.019
whenever we're dealing with cereals we gotta get into the cetaneous right

00:16:57.019 --> 00:17:03.420
remember take it down all of these drugs and this is hard for us to understand

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:09.900
but they're using not one drug at a time they're using compounds against other

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:15.780
compounds so multiple component drugs that are the doubt

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:21.900
and the antidote or the anti-farmicon being these mixtures that are used to

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:28.319
buffer right to maximize the potential without killing the patient so they're

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:35.240
under the influence of a lot of drugs and you know they tweak it with the more opium here do you have you seen how much

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:41.100
nicortis has on opium right the surgeons are using Mandrake if they want to put

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:47.940
you to sleep to take something out of you or to cauterize he says they have to

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:54.660
put you under the influence the Mandrake it can knock you out for two to three hours and their hours are like two and a

00:17:54.660 --> 00:18:03.419
half hours so um and that's why he says the surgeons use them the surgeons use them right

00:18:03.419 --> 00:18:11.340
um good good good but we have these states how what if we are missing

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:17.760
what if we are missing something here and that we have failed

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.580
in our struggle for mental health we fail to cast out our demons

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:31.200
because we dropped the ball we dropped the ball we let the compounds and the

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.539
knowledge of those compounds go we let them go and now we've got nothing

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:42.419
on the receiving end we know that these chemicals work in the brain we know they

00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:48.380
do certain things we know that when you enter death the brain acts differently

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:56.000
yes yes now what do we know about inducing this state in an individual

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.679
through a pro a poly pharmaceutical process right the only way we're going

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:06.900
to get there is through the mandrake is through the actual evidence to the

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:13.200
actual drugs that are used this is this is fantastic this is fantastic

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.240

mean the thing that causes love and affection right that thing that that

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:08.100
brings you there so remember when we're talking Antiquity we're talking this the

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:15.840
sexiness of the science is off the chart right all of it is complaining about oh

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:21.720
man I've been taking so many aphrodisiacs I can't get an erection anymore what am I going to do for that

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:30.000
right so uh what do you in order to exist in the society where

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.179
they're using all of these drugs in a very sophisticated way you've got to have a college of priestesses please

00:20:36.179 --> 00:20:41.580
those of you with Bronze Age that realized the letter the the level that

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:46.740
we're working with here it's just phenomenal it's it's off the charts the

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:52.400
um education here is off the charts is wonderful um I just want to

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.780
make one quick note from the text right

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:05.400
um you'll get a lot of talk about well you know you take so much and you know you take you uh you take even more

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:11.400
double that and this kind of group of symptoms you'll get you won't just get you won't just get the Mania The

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:20.280
psychosis right that's stage one by the way for all of you who are keeping track with our uh drug cocktails yes that's

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:27.360
we're at stage one here is the Mania right so you have to keep it at a

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:33.780
certain level right you don't go off the edge and you know thank goodness there's

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:40.679
guys like nikander who say look here's the antidotes for when you catch these people out and they've just they've

00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:47.280
they're off the edge and all they can do is make animal noises right remember where are we we're at the late Bronze

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:54.780
Age and if you're not careful Cersei Queen of the Etruscans is going to cut

00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:00.000
off your gonads and give you drugs anally through with a

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:09.000
wand and puts you into a cage turn you into that eunuch uh servant right oh God turn

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.900
you into that pig what do you think the sybils are coming from in the Bronze Age where do you think that tradition is

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:21.299
coming from civil is a trafficking word man that c is the word for gods

00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:26.880
I didn't get that from anywhere I got that from John lettuce you want to look up

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:34.080
we'll look up John lettuce see what he says about sybils yeah love it love it I

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:39.179
love this stuff so here we are we're we still got the Mandrake and I still want

00:22:39.179 --> 00:22:46.140
you to see what are we doing we're going into oh we're going into that manic we're going into that manic stage okay

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:53.700
so what is the delirium that is so beneficial medicinally that

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:59.220
we are bringing right what is that because that's the state that we want to

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:06.900
get to and we're only going to get there with the proper balance of drugs and the right sexual act that's going to get us

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:13.500
somebody asked me what's the purpose of all of the of all of the use of this drug right that these guys like

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:19.620
Pythagoras and these oracles are flipping out on what's the use of this kind of thing

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:25.740
um is it just vision is it just insight um and I would have to say I would have

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:32.100
to say you and I are sitting in history of oracles it doesn't matter what

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:37.320
countries you're from it doesn't matter what your peoples are what your ethnicities are it doesn't matter what

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:44.460
your language is you are still sitting within a history that is a struggle for

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:51.000
the mystery itself for the performance of the mystery to bring back that cup of

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.940
Lady Babylon is the greatest danger to the Christian religion it's the greatest

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:02.400
danger to the um the followers of Moses

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:09.419
I'm not talking those Israelis that are out partying the Disco right who talk about the deutsies I'm not talking about

00:24:09.419 --> 00:24:15.059
those people I'm talking about the Orthodox talking about the fundamentalists right

00:24:15.059 --> 00:24:23.039
um this greatest threat to their system is the control of the mystery is the

00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:29.340
control of the mystery and what was this mystery that was operating in the

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:35.460
ancient world what was the purpose out of it every time out of it

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:40.980
comes the oracular capacity

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:47.159
to read the future and the past in the present now dang I was like before you

00:24:47.159 --> 00:24:54.720
jump and you're like oh it's fortune telling right it is fortune telling

00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:03.480
but it's fortune telling on a scientific level it's fortune telling via chemistry and

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:10.440
Via music yeah it's an it's an accelerated form of

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:17.280
learning it's the Pythagorean root it's the reason he's in the cave

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:23.159
yes it's a development it's a development for

00:25:23.159 --> 00:25:29.279
Jesus and Mary ever got together [Music]

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:34.880
he had to cast seven demons out of her

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.900
so these states of mania that are

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:46.020
associated with the sotel right were originally states of mania

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:53.279
associated with the sotterra with the sotera yeah throw me up this

00:25:53.279 --> 00:26:00.120
last I need the devil said hurry up tonight we're gonna have it seven at half past we're gonna have uh

we'll mention these so you have the regular sleep and then you have the manic state right and some of the plants

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:42.360
are better at introducing that Maniac state that that good Mania right okay

00:27:03.179 --> 00:27:10.440
for them um these the followers of kotito don't you like that one oh that's a good one

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:17.100
um this is what you've got on board this is what you're doing this is what you're doing to enter go ahead and put up a

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:22.140
sequence I want people to see a sequiest um look here you know this is to be

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:29.100
crazy money Apple tastes poems from the communion drink right from the potion

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:34.380
itself right um there's a heart to the Mandrake oh

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:42.240
Eve is always she's always right there pertinent there's a heart to the Mandrake and he

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.820
die scored he says you can give somebody that heart that fruit right you can give

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:53.820
somebody that fruit and that fruit is the thing that opens the eyes

00:27:53.820 --> 00:28:00.240
that fruit is the heightened awareness

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:07.260
yeah it is that thing which got us all kicked out of the garden yeah right now

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:12.720
we have to have that painful childbirth don't be fooled this all goes back to

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.760
the childbirth if you don't have a fetus somehow involved here you're in the

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:24.779
wrong place and if you aren't considering seriously considering drinking fetal

00:28:24.779 --> 00:28:32.700
juice then you don't drink the blood and eat the flesh

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:38.658
yes you don't drink the blood and eat the flesh

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:45.299
with the Mandrake with the Mandrake we can follow we can say okay we've got

00:28:45.299 --> 00:28:51.120
another group we've got another group of drugs that are what

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:57.600
um I'm calling constellations that's my own I'm just trying to characterize what's going on

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:04.140
but we've got another constellation of drugs that has a very specific role that

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:10.440
you can see driven throughout the history from the earliest recorded Greek that we've got from the earliest

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:16.200
recorded Greek when all we've got's the one I saw right all we've got is the one

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:23.820
I saw we have those drugs from the very beginning and we have these women and I

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:30.240
just I really want them to stress um we are starting to see because the

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.340
Bronze Age archeology is flourishing right now and we're beginning to see

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:43.039
different kind of society that is this poison arrow horse culture

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:49.799
and we we see that there are surprise surprise there are women who are the

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:57.140
generals you know the Chinese didn't like this in the Bronze Age um they had a very male driven and were

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:04.679
looked down upon female on power yeah um because their problem was with

00:30:04.679 --> 00:30:11.460
those guys who were riding around whose women are the generals yeah and who were fighting out in the

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:17.159
front yeah and they're mobile horse troops yeah the Greeks had to deal with

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:23.640
these people too right these were the Ahmad zone or these were the

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:29.880
um massive guitar yeah these were the people who were there these are the people who were

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:35.720
there to use that poison in the arrow so Mandrake tonight

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:45.179
Mandrake we've got to root ourselves in the physical nature of what they were

00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:51.620
doing tonight's Mandrake shows us

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:58.620
that we can have families of drugs that are meant to achieve certain

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:05.700
effects in health certain effects in cult we can have those families of drugs and

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:39.179

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:23.520
all boy is a intensive Greek student and he has an interest in finding out things

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:29.158
Britain and tonight I just want to ask him as an ignoramus as somebody who does

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:36.179
not study this field it isn't it is not my field um but I like to dabble in it because we

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:41.460
all can read right I tell me something do we have any overlap between these

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:47.040
classical Bronze Age Queens performing their magic and doing their

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:52.440
sexual thing do we have any overlap between these and you know are there

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:57.780
britons anywhere that we can pull up Rock and find these same people tell me about it

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:04.560
I've definitely first of all can you hear me okay okay so um

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:11.460
basically I've come at this from a point of view where I actually was looking into this history and

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:16.859
mythology and um I started noticing these sort of themes

00:35:16.859 --> 00:35:24.060
and then when I stumbled across your work um I noticed that there was the similarities and that was kind of

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:30.599
um spurred me on to look into it deeper for sure so as I've gone into some of the texts

00:35:30.599 --> 00:35:35.760
and I'm looking at it through this lens of trying to um

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:40.800
well just seeing it from everything that you've been sort of teaching and showing in these past videos and there's

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:46.380
definitely more tips that are cropping up that are similar so basically today

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:52.260
um the presentation that I've got we've we've looked at some of the uh the Irish mythology it's actually taken us to the

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:59.539
Irish mythology and to uh to move so that's who we're going to be looking at today

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:06.000
fantastic do you want to just throw her out there um I know that let me ask this I know

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.520
that meve is the same uh is is the same

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:18.240
person as medb is the same person perhaps as m a b

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:23.579
what is it with the overlap of these princesses can we can we keep these

00:36:23.579 --> 00:36:28.680
people straight or are they all becoming one well they're definitely

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:37.740
um the Linguistics definitely think there's some connection and between the old Irish and the the old Welsh so Maeve

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:43.859
which is sometimes spell medb um her name is assumed to be cognated

00:36:43.859 --> 00:36:48.980
with the Celtic medu which means made from the pro to end up here and sorry

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:54.359
proto-indo-european medu which is made or honey this is continued into the old

00:36:54.359 --> 00:37:01.079
Irish mid the old Welsh meth modern-day Welsh Mev which is spelled me Double D

00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:07.619
and Breton Mez so Breton is the um it's kind of like the Brittany area so this

00:37:07.619 --> 00:37:14.940
was a colony that left from uh Cornwall and set up in Brittany sort of horse Roman

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:22.380
era so you also get the adjective which is derived from the noun and

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:27.480
underlies the old Irish Maeve which is strong or intoxicating and in the Welsh

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:32.940
you get methu which means drunk and so you can see that this

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:39.839
see the thing that I like about the the Welsh is that um you can see the component word

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:45.900
so for example meth means the Mead you have methu which is intoxicated

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.940
there's a herbal remedy called methylene um which that's got quite a history to

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:57.540
it seems to be a bit of a watered down version of it uh these days but when you read in the old text it does seem to be

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:02.700
more of like a herbal kind of Remedy and then a doctor is actually a mevig so you

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:10.320
can see how the component it has connotations associated with healing and also intoxication and that's

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:17.280
where um the crossover seems to be because um maeve's daughter findavar some people

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:24.420
actually link um that name with Guinevere because in the Welsh it's pronounced so it's

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:29.579
slightly different in the Welsh and in the old Welsh and the old Irish there's there's this kind of connection which

00:38:29.579 --> 00:38:36.000
some people say exists it makes me think that that

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.040
um Pulaski and they think maybe the proto-indo-european was pulaskian or

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.380
something um it makes me think that this overlap between

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:54.720
the Mycenaean dicama in medwa versus Medea versus your

00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:02.940
um britons and counts Welsh Irish using this very same root it makes me think

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:08.760
that somehow that's older and it's coming through linguistically it's coming through

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:14.760
different branches I wonder do you think what do you think of the magic angle of

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:19.800
all of this because aren't don't all of these women have magical powers

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:25.440
yeah for sure so there's there's a few kind of areas that link from Mev so you

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:31.619
have um a goddess kind of aspect you also have a sovereignty aspect and you

00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:38.880
also just have the um there is like a ruler and a A Healer and EV all of the meetings that take

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:44.280
place um the large meetings they always occur in the Mead Hall as well so that's kind

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:49.619
of like her her space if she's the uh the meadwoman which is what they believe

00:39:49.619 --> 00:39:55.020
her name means so this is where all the meetings take place in the Mead Hall and

00:39:55.020 --> 00:40:01.140
um with regards to the magic there's there's definitely inclinations to that in the text

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:07.020
um especially as you have one there's one text which actually mentions that

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:14.339
um kirkullan's Chariot Rider he actually it says has um a mantle made of ravens

00:40:14.339 --> 00:40:19.380
feathers which was given to him by Simon migas so there's and then there's these other

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:26.700
kind of sections where because kukul and he's kind of like a hero figure and he you

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:34.320
know he basically Slaughters everybody that he comes across but he goes into these frenzies these rages and it often

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:40.140
mentions this kind of an underlying meaning to the text you can tell you know for example

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:47.339
um if I find one so one of the four tellings uh regarding cuckoo and this is what it says fear of

00:40:47.339 --> 00:40:53.700
Deeds the man I see wounded saw is his fair skin on his brow shines the hero's

00:40:53.700 --> 00:41:00.000
light Victory seat is in his face seven gems of Champions Brave deck the center

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.660
of his orbs his eyes naked are the spears he bears and he hooks a red clock around

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:13.200
Nobles faces he I see he respects all womankind younger lad and fresh is you

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:18.900
with a dragon's form in in fight so that's just an example of um of how

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:27.480
he's described and there are actually a couple of um of sooths so in the free Feast of Bri

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:33.900
crew you have um three Champions and the basically they're all in a competition

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:40.980
to see who's the greatest champion and it kind of escalates as the story goes along and eventually they decide to

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:46.859
go to mirv and allele's Castle to see who can prove themselves to be worthy of

00:41:46.859 --> 00:41:52.500
the Champions portion which is kind of like a prize so these three Charities

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:58.680
they're all racing towards the castle and um and may have asked s finovar

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:05.099
um to describe the Chariot and she says I see another chariots coming along the plane give us its description core from

00:42:05.099 --> 00:42:10.680
Eve I see in sooth so this is a soothsayer which is kind of almost like

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:16.079
a prophecy it's the kind of seat with a Second Sight and basically she describes

00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:21.599
the horse coming and then um when you get onto the description of cocoon this

00:42:21.599 --> 00:42:28.740
is what I have to say in the Chariot a sad Melancholy Man cumliest of the men are therein around him as soft Crimson

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:35.099
pleasing tunic fastened across the breast where it stands open with the salmon brooch of Inland gold against

00:42:35.099 --> 00:42:40.140
which is bosom heaves beating in full strokes and then it goes to describe in

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:46.619
great detail his horses and then it says um set in each of his eyes eight red

00:42:46.619 --> 00:42:53.040
dragon gemstones his two cheeks blue white and blood red he emits Sparks of

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:58.680
fire and burning breath with a ray of love in his look a shower of pearls May

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:04.079
thinketh have fallen into his mouth each of his two eyebrows as black as the

00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:09.359
side of a black Spit on His Two thighs rest his golden hilted sword and fasten

00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:15.180
to The Copper frame of The Chariot is his blood red spear it goes on and just describes him but

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:21.359
you can basically I can I can tell here that there's an underlying uh theme there's a there's a

00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:27.599
second meaning to this script in my opinion and I can kind of see some of the images

00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:35.339
that I get from from your work and from what I've seen from your presentations what do you what do you think oh boy

00:43:35.339 --> 00:43:43.200
about the prophetic side so you've got that tradition of in monmouth's work of

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:50.099
Merlin being that Prophet right somehow somehow he has stepped outside and he's

00:43:50.099 --> 00:43:57.420
able to have this uncanny ability to understand the future in in the present

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:04.020
so he's always he's Beyond everybody's reach that oracular and power of the

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:12.480
Civil is associated with with specific drug cult ritual so I guess what I'm

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.359
asking is does this thing just thrive in nature do we just have it coming over

00:44:18.359 --> 00:44:24.119
and over are we perpetuating a priesthood through time or is this

00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:30.359
something that just spontaneously um erupts how is Merlin that oracular

00:44:30.359 --> 00:44:35.940
Prophet how is he captured that role so much so that the prophets that the

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:44.099
prophets the diastorities are talking about um are are claiming that these are their base

00:44:44.099 --> 00:44:51.060
Powers these drugs are their base Powers so is Merlin when uh first of all is

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:58.200
Merlin a drug user and second of all what's the real power of Prophecy here

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.839
and is it natural is it just coming up or is it some kind of you know some kind

00:45:03.839 --> 00:45:09.240
of perpetuation of a Priestly thing

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:14.760
so in uh Jeffrey of monmouth's work it's it's clearly seen as a really important

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:20.880
um aspect of of the community as well I suppose because one of the uh the Kings

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:28.020
he's desperate to get Merlin back he takes off into the woods and Jeffrey of Monmouth himself is clearly familiar

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:34.859
with the the the great Classics um I've seen people describe his Vita

00:45:34.859 --> 00:45:40.500
Merlin it's actually written in um in hexameter from what I've seen and um he

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:46.859
mentions and cites quite a lot of these works such as Ovid

00:45:46.859 --> 00:45:52.680
um Epistles from pontus things like this and he Compares Merlin to silenus to

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:59.040
some degree in the life of Merlin and he takes off into the woods because he doesn't want anything to do with money

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:06.900
people he just wants to live in the woods with the animals and and the trees and nature and he's obsessed with his uh

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:13.619
with his apple trees so there's also always mention of these apples and um actually Avalon

00:46:13.619 --> 00:46:20.640
where Arthur later goes when he's when he's wounded is that comes from the Avalon comes from the word apple as well

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:28.200
it means the Isle of apples so there's always these mention of of the apples as well so I I personally do believe that

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:33.960
there was drug use going on and um there was an early writer called uh Camden I

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:42.359
believe if memory serves and he actually says that the uh the Celtic bellus or belliness

00:46:42.359 --> 00:46:48.300
um comes from hembin because the Welsh language funnily enough also kind of

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:55.619
letters mutate so the beginning of a word the letter can change a bit like in the Greek you know how it

00:46:55.619 --> 00:47:01.920
Tunes the the words when they run into each other so the sound better the Welsh kind of does the same and a contraction

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:09.720
of Belling would be melon which means yellow so it's something to do with this yellow bright God and

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:15.960
um and obviously belting they're burning these big fires the worship in the god uh Bell

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:22.380
so I think looking at the uh the cultures as well where the scene is you

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:28.800
know breathing in this this fumigation and taking on the qualities of the deity you know it does seem it seems to tickle

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:34.800
the boxes for me personally anyway yeah nice gorgeous gorgeous it always

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:43.920
comes back to those apples of the disparities doesn't it and it's it's almost as if Nature has a has a state

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:51.240
that you can discover that you can go there and discover and that you have Clues along the way and it's putting it

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:56.640
together and finding it all sudden when you found that you get weird things like

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:01.680
this great healer right when you said Merlin takes Arthur there right he takes

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:07.020
him to be healed right to her so I mean there's a reason that Cersei kills

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:14.700
Odysseus and brings him back to life right and like a Fraun is the one who who brings that in so there's something

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:22.319
about these I've often wondered oh boy if it is not the case that through time

00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:29.760
the Civil propagates herself and that the Romans weren't as crazy as we

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:34.800
thought they were and because they said that very thing this

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:40.920
um even the smarty Greeks with their heraclitus um understood the power of the

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:46.800
propagation of the Sybil was it a fact that she lived over a thousand years was

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:52.940
it a fact that she always appeared to be a teenager was it a fact that she gave

00:48:52.940 --> 00:49:00.480
the laws that start our uh our civilization and I mean us modern you

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:07.980
know on both sides of the pond right that Civilization we we are what we are because of these traditions and these

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:13.260
Traditions look at the Hinman these Traditions are rooted and some Advanced

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:20.160
pharmacology that holds great promise for medicine if if you can take a

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:26.400
substance like Scopolamine or atropy and under the right circumstances you

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:32.640
can cause somebody to enter that Maniac phase and then bring them out of it and

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:38.339
they achieve some sort of recircetering recircuitizing

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:47.460
um reorganization reorientation of the brain I don't know what it is the the neuro guys will figure it out but but

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:53.280
yeah there's something there's something there that we can we can't overlook this oh boy

00:49:53.280 --> 00:50:01.680
um thank you for coming tonight and I know that I'll have much demand to bring you back please continue this research

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:08.339
um I want to be I want to be creating a history for us here where we can see the

00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:16.440
movements of these things I had somebody just asked me today what happened that you know when the sybils failed when

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:22.460
they when it done the flame died out the iraqiar flame died out and Christianity

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:29.760
took over um and oppressed that movement is that where we lost progress medically is that

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:35.400
where we're we slowed ourselves down yeah with this history nobody nobody

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:41.819
studies this stuff but now that they've found the they found the hen band thank goodness they found him because I

00:50:41.819 --> 00:50:49.020
thought this was I thought this wasn't going to be sexy at all but now now it's totally sexy filters can I ask you one

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:54.540
last question and then I'm gonna go I'm I'm I'll be at the meeting tonight

00:50:54.540 --> 00:51:00.599
um on lady Babylon but I wanna I wanna ask you this what is the sex connection

00:51:00.599 --> 00:51:09.000
everything you've been reading about what have you gotten just like a general sense of the sex connection

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.180
yeah it's it's definitely there because um if you look at at mayor the self

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:20.460
um it looks like she had nine husbands and you actually you had to marry her to

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:27.180
become the king and the deal was sealed with a with an offer from a from a cup

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:32.460
um from a chalice so and even in the texts for example she's

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:37.559
not married to cocoon but um when he when he comes she knows he's going to be

00:51:37.559 --> 00:51:44.220
he's got this rage so she does everything to play K team they bring out Thrice and 50 women this is a a number

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:50.280
that crops up time and time again Thrice and 50. and um and then but she spends

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:56.819
the night with him herself as well even though her husband's in the castle so you know she's spending that time with

00:51:56.819 --> 00:52:02.400
him and it says in the text as well he gets the uh the Champions reward which

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:07.980
is a drink from a chalice and wine and she gives him a dragon Stone as well and

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:13.260
it says the size of both of his eyes and then I've been to a few

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:19.380
um of these all buildings these old aristocratic houses just in England and

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:25.440
I have seen images of um of the man fooding from the breast as well so you

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:32.599
know there's people who who are definitely trying to preserve this anywhere definitely

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:38.940
yeah and we didn't get there tonight but in that okay so if we know that the

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:45.420
sexuality is part part and parcel of the whole foundation of the right

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:51.960
um and the Kings and the passing on of power right all that kind of stuff right it's all there all the way back to

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:58.440
Georgia where we're talking about um kingdoms yeah definitely

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:04.920
um could it be could it be I I hate to keep pushing this because people don't they

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:11.359
don't want to talk about it but could it be that they were doing they found something that they were doing something

00:53:11.359 --> 00:53:18.000
medically that was sexual and involved drugs this just uh because of our weird

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.579
kind of perverted history that we don't we can't look at it for what it is is

00:53:23.579 --> 00:53:29.040
there any hope this is that how I'll ask is there any hope all boy for for

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:36.740
um bringing back the the sex right without without cracking

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:43.079
the ceiling of the universe you know what I mean I think definitely I think definitely

00:53:43.079 --> 00:53:49.200
there's a way to do it I think it's it's down to understanding as well really and I think you know you present that idea

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:54.720
to to somebody who who hasn't got the context and the background and you know that probably it would seem quite

00:53:54.720 --> 00:54:01.200
abstract to them but certainly when you're reading these these mythologies and these texts it just seems you know

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:08.040
people didn't kind of bat an eyelid to that kind of thing you know cocullen's wife she's letting him go off and do

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:13.920
these types of things so I think there's definitely scope I think it's just getting a bit more of an understanding

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:22.859
out there you know to uh to a wider audience it's just a matter of time before we we have fetal communion

00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:31.319
fetal communion that will enable us to fend off certain diseases enable us to

00:54:31.319 --> 00:54:38.460
live longer healthier lives maybe less inflammatory lives something something

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:45.359
[Music] anti-carcinogenic you know something that gives us you know why did they hold

00:54:45.359 --> 00:54:50.880
up this Serpent and why did they follow these Traditions why is this the thing
