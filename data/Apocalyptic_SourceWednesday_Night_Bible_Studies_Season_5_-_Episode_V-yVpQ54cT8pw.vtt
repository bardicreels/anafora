yes yes this is the origin remember classical Hebrew vocabulary tiny tiny

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:40.279

through the drugs through the drugs and the sexual

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:24.660
intercourse when we're doing that we are drawing down the Moon

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.699
the power of the Moon and what does that mean all the any classes you meet can

00:16:29.699 --> 00:16:36.480
tell you that drawing down the moon drawn down all the esoteric fruitcakes on the planet can tell you that drawing

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:41.699
down the moon drawing down the Moon they don't know what it means

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:49.459
to draw down the moon because it tells us here you draw down the moon within the whole

00:16:49.459 --> 00:16:56.579
within the Venom bring up that Holy bring that bring up that whole egg and look at this look at this bile look at

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:18.178
wait look at the Hebrew okay we just said Hebrew Greek here's a perfect example right here it is I don't take I

00:17:18.179 --> 00:17:24.480
don't take pleasuredness I don't take pleasure in this very but it's my duty

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:32.820
to reality to you know be straight up with it okay so look at number three with the

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:40.400
Hebrew a poisonous plant various variously called Hemlock or Poppy

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:48.059
poisonous plant do you see what state the classical Hebrew language is in it

00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:54.120
is so infantile it is so non-specific that you don't know if the plant that

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:59.880
you've got is an opium poppy for pain killing or Hemlock to kill you

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:07.140
hmm Julian Julian the apostate come here

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:13.640
Julian come here tell the folks well what was your position

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:21.660
emperor Emperor Roman Emperor fantastic and uh Julian what did you

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:28.020
tell the people about the galileans the people we know

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:33.120
now call Christians what

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:39.679
what they they they're making a mistake with the Hebrew

00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:44.700
the there's no show me what Julian says

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:53.520
show me the math show me your works of literature on medicine he says that show

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.820
me they have none they have none

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:06.240
what happened what happened it's not their people and we've we've

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:12.120
suffered because of the wake of the attempt to establish Hebrew as the

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:18.720
earliest tax it's not it's not it's not let's keep going do you see that go back

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:26.820
to that definition do you see that they they the language itself can't even distinguish between two plants within a

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:32.580
pharmacopoeia for the Greeks has thousands of species

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:37.919
now there is a secret in translation

00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:45.419
it's unidirectional can only go one way

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:53.700
yeah you can only go one way you cannot take a text and translate it with a

00:19:53.700 --> 00:20:00.539
higher degree of technicality than it possessed and that's what we've got going on in

00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:08.520
your Bible in your Bible the great level level of technological

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:15.660
achievement is higher it can't be a translation for example in

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.940
Noah's Ark I just want to bring up Noah's Ark somebody asked me about the Ozark

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:26.280
in Noah's Ark when the building instructions are given

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:32.340
in the Greek it talks about the first and the second floor

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:38.640
of the structure that's being built and the technical term is the area of this roofed

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:44.700
first floor second floor fantastic what is the Hebrew say for

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:51.840
that the it says the first and the second without any four without any architectural reference what it's just

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:58.440
first and second whereas the Greek uses two terms that are architectural terms

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:05.039
with the word first and second in them with the floors the people who back

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:10.620
translated the Hebrew obviously couldn't handle the technical advancement of the

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:15.799
Greek that is not what translators do

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:20.940
translators do not dump technicality into a text

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.340
you can't make a text more technical than you got it it doesn't work that way

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:32.640
it's dishonest and it's propagandistic so here we go I'm sorry let's get back

right remember that your cup of divination what is that what is that

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.820
let's bring up that text again yeah watch this watch isn't this the thing

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:06.480
you know the cop in which my Lord drinks yeah he himself works his divination

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:14.840
look at those words on that second line or your needs a tie in our door

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:20.519
oh God love it to all your needs though what does that mean please tell me take

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:27.240
it down please tell me that's a translation of the Hebrew no it's not no it's not it's highly technical

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:32.340
terminology that if you look at what the Hebrew turns it into the classical

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:39.059
Hebrew turns it into it's a shame it's a shame and it's laughable it's so bad

00:33:39.059 --> 00:33:44.100
it's laughable yeah this is a terrible anybody who's

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:50.820
reading a Bible today if it says Bible on the cover and you were reading

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:57.960
the Old Testament you're reading garbage garbage

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:05.519
garbage anybody who is reading a Hebrew based Old Testament is reading a

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:11.820
terrible translation of a fantastic perfectly normal Greek work

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:19.679
yeah isn't that weird isn't that weird thing about it for a moment you're living in a lie where

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:26.520
people go to churches and synagogues people of the book go to go to mosques

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:33.300
and they think what they are reading is based upon what was really written it's

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:38.638
not it's a it's a terrible translation of a very sophisticated and beautiful

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:45.720
group of Greek works fantastic and that's where all this terminology is coming from it's where

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:52.440
it's all coming from let's go down to the next one please yeah um so what happens here's the entire

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:59.099
passage you know he says isn't this the cop you know the one that I have my things notice on the first line that I

00:34:59.099 --> 00:35:06.200
Divine from this will be Transit not us on the first line we noticed that the cop at the end of the sentence

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:13.440
it's silver take it down why does he have a silver cup that is using the same

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:20.760
Greek root that we just saw in the orphic text that we had that we translated right at the top

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:29.780
huh because it's part of the technology that is how you divine in a silver

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:35.640
container you look into it and what do you need what do you need to perform the

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.640
canomancy under the moonlight foreign

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:48.359
you need the holy of that Viper you need that hole and you need a boy

00:35:48.359 --> 00:35:53.940
okay you need the holy and you need the boy so when Jesus

00:35:53.940 --> 00:36:00.720
is in the Garden of Gethsemane and he's got something that's making him thirsty

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:07.160
just like the holy does and he's got that naked kid with him

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:16.500
he's in a position for us to say in court that he was a diviner

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:23.280
yeah he was a deviner this guy is historically a divider he meets all the criteria for it he's using all the right

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:29.160
titles he's got all the right drugs he's got the naked kid

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.500
for those of you didn't know Jesus was with a naked Kid Mark 14 51 52.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:40.500
please write to me and tell me what that naked kid was doing there

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:46.740
yeah fantastic fantastic let's go let's go to the we got a couple more I got a

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:52.980
couple goodies for you I'm just going to throw in go ahead because I think they're they're important look at this look at this

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:58.320
um the silver cup up that's not important it's just I want you to notice it's silver why are they using the

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:06.240
silver cops by the way some of you witches can tell me yeah silver cup mirror mirror on the

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:14.880
wall baby capture that Moonlight love it somebody passed the snake venom

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:21.359
let's go to the next one fantastic oh I just thought this was funny I was looking at the Hebrew just

00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:28.079
to see what kind of nonsense they would pull look um this word signifies to view

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:36.420
attentively to learn by a tent of observation or experience to his whisper to Divine to encant it's also a serpent

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:41.940
it's also the hissing it's also some brass copper and iron does anybody see

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:47.280
what's going on if you study a language take it down it's embarrassing if you

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.579
study a dead language like I do um and you get a word that is a shotgun

00:37:52.579 --> 00:37:58.200
of completely different concepts you know they're not using a root

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:05.700
yeah because those roots bind you to certain meanings you can't just slap together what

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:12.480
somebody's doing when they do that is they're trying to say um this word was also used for this word

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:20.160
and also used for this word and also use in other words we don't know yeah and when you get back translations

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:25.980
of the Greek this is what they're forced to do they were forced those Orthodox

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:31.380
rabbis were forced to do this you've got to take what you've got and work with it

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:39.480
or else it's not the it's not the language of God yeah it's sad sad but you know when you

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:45.420
they painted themselves into a corner I don't think we should feel sorry for people who

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:52.440
who have have betrayed reason we've got to stay in that realm of

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:57.839
Reason we've got to know right because what happens when you betray reason you

00:38:57.839 --> 00:39:03.780
start to believe lies in next thing you know is you're just

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:10.859
living one gigantic lie yes fantastic let's stay true man stay

00:39:10.859 --> 00:39:16.380
true here's a shout out for staying true next one but uh

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:21.540
there we go um I want everybody to look at Bruce Metzger at the bottom of this I'm gonna

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:28.140
stop um worrying about those of you who who are under the delusion that Hebrew is

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:35.640
the language of the Old Testament and I'm just going to show you Bruce Metzger this is what he said is outstanding

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:41.520
textual critic there's all sorts of there's all sorts of people on here Scholars and I was going to read all

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:46.859
these to you guys about the letter of aristeas which long story short is a

00:39:46.859 --> 00:39:54.480
forgery that was meant to say the world in which we live is one where the

00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:01.920
original Hebrew scriptures were translated by the Greeks under Ptolemy philadelphus yeah and that's not the

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:09.240
case not only did aristes never live but anybody who reads it can recognize

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:14.940
right away it's just propaganda it's just a way of taking over a source or an

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:21.480
origin and saying that belongs to us because it's originally in the Hebrew it's not originally in the Hebrew

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:27.839
so this is what Massacre says most Scholars who have analyzed the letter have concluded the author cannot have

00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:34.680
been the man who represented himself to be but was a Jew who wrote a fictitious account in order to enhance the

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:41.339
importance of the Hebrew scriptures by suggesting that a pagan King had recognize their significance and

00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:49.740
therefore arranged for the translation into Greek um yeah what we're trying to do next and

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:57.060
what we're trying to do is we're trying to create a world no I'll just go this way we're trying to create a world where

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:03.780
um we can justify certain things right and the Christians were perfectly happy to roll with it

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:09.720
right because it only buttresses them anybody who's a person of the book

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:19.920
right I'm talking about those great three religions they are based on an historical lie

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:27.359
and I'm saying lie because it was intentional it was a misrepresentation of History

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:33.300
a misrepresentation of history and surely there's somebody sitting in this

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:40.500
