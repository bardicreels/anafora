as media is to Jason wow that's the most spectacular

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:50.599
question and I'm gonna answer it linguistically there is a 16th century

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:59.400
cryptologist who talks about the mdll being a cyan word that is

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.200
the equivalent of the Maga right not the MOs but the Maga this

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.480
is the one that came before did the witch come before the wizard yes it

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.519
turns out historically she did who else was going to figure out all that stuff

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:28.080
right took a lot of brains here we go here we go I want to bring you that Maga

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.080
that Maga is the medwa and that

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.759
medwa is in charge is in

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:46.600
Union with the yasus yeah so is there a relation

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.800
between them yeah these are all cult titles people we're going to read these things over and over again right wow

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:01.759
until we see it it's all there love it great question great question that's what happens when you stay in the cult

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:07.080
right it's what happens you get the you get the queen and the Christ isn't that

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.039
nice love it who do you think was supplying all the drugs

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:18.520
yeah wasn't Jesus yeah he knows how to make the

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.840
punch but he was getting it all from Mary the

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.000
Maga yeah yeah you can call her a prostitute

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.520
if you want to um but tonight since we're going to Mainline we're going to

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.639
Mainline with Jesus and I know some of you are sensitive about using terms like

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.680
that we're talking about historical mainlining we're going to find that

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:56.400
place where you can take that christed poison you can get it right into the

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:03.680

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.720
need another com I forgot the bad we've had the good we have to have the bad okay throw up the

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.319
bad okay this is from Naruto another interesting experience

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:37.520
particularly unpleasant particularly unpleasant not just unpleasant it's

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.560
particularly unpleasant I expected at least at very

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.240
least something from Pho okay take it down take it down I cannot take this

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.919
person seriously anymore I can't no I'm gonna laugh I'm gonna laugh and it's

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:00.840
rude it's rude to do that but my

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.478
children in the world there are perpetrators with trench

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:17.800
coats and they will take you places and do things to you yeah yeah they that's what they do

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:25.400
that's it's their nature if I were the professional

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.440
conference in the middle of a bunch of classical philos ologist who had given

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.479
the sweat and blood and earned that

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:41.879
spot if I pulled out

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:51.159
Philo right away right away right you lose your credibility right away when

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:56.879
you do that Naruto you lose your credibility because Naruto there are

00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:04.639
Bible studies there are studies of the Torah there are Bible studies there are

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:11.759
seminaries there are new testament departments and in these departments

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:17.800
Naruto there are no philologists

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:24.800
philologists are those who have reached the level of

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:32.080
expertise where they are expected to go to the international gymnasia and

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:40.200
wrestle that's what they're expected to do you cannot get by on what Bible

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.839
studies does for you it is a sinking

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:51.760
ship that has been barely floating for the last 1600

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:59.200
years yeah you see because there's a problem in the universe the problem is the classical

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.680
philologists are the professionals with the classical

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:11.200
Texs right you should be able to throw a classical philologist anything from Homer throw them a little bit of tacitus

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:18.720
little curveball there how about some juvenile can you slip in do you know how to do meter between both languages okay

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:25.880
those are the people that you consult what's weird in this universe

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:31.920
the Watchers still haven't figured it out but what's really weird

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:37.720
here is that those experts are experts in everything but the Bible and the

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:44.360
septu included when I say Bible yeah

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:51.920
yeah and do you know why let me just tell you as a former Prof

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.959
myself you do not want to risk the

00:09:56.959 --> 00:10:04.000
engagement because a classical philologist I'm just telling you this tonight a classical

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.079
philologist can tear your BS apart because for

00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:17.480
every second that you have read they have read

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.560
Millions it is their life they have devoted themselves to this Sacred

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.120
Space so when you pull out Pho that's what the seminarians do that's what the

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:36.480
religious schools do and look my children when

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:43.000
these people in trench coats come to you they're gonna open that trench

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.120
coat they're going to open it [Music] up with a big Seminary and smile on

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:59.880
their face they're going to show you the twins the twins Josephus and F

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:07.920
ILO and you're going to gag on those twins you're going to gag on

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.240
them what I recommend you do um because the people at the time

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:20.320
said hey you know that guy Josephus he's making up

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:28.440
sources right right that's a huge problem this all culminates people

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:35.800
please understand me why this is so important this all culminates in Julian the apostate we

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:42.600
call him Julian the apostate who made a

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000
decree nobody can teach Classics who's an

00:11:51.760 --> 00:12:00.800
atheist interesting interesting and why would that be Julian because they corrupt the

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:09.680
text it's their intention in establishing their own fake

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:15.199
history do you mean this is about power this is about power essentially about a

00:12:15.199 --> 00:12:22.079
power grab oh yeah what do you think those humans do the the aren't you guys

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:28.240
the episcop boy aren't you the ones who are watching all of this go around oh

educated educated educated and as a highly Highly Educated person his

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:27.959
proficiency with GRE is just phenomenal they called him you know the honey

00:16:27.959 --> 00:16:34.120
tongue because his Greek was so good good for you good for you he's he's adzing a

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:40.199
little bit here this is a little bit of second sophistic for those of you who are into it now I've worked with this

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:47.560
passage with several students I'm just gonna give you a I'm just going to translate it very quickly because we

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.720
don't have a lot of time we all us face it right or attention let's go bring it

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.560
up what's going to happen you know the bites of the Viper and of other types of

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:04.079
snakes people say that you know we have curatives for this we have drugs for

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:10.319
this and I hear that these drugs are in two forms they're either Pata they're

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:16.880
either potions or they're they are things that you apply

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:23.798
as christing Kai epoo this so he goes on and he says hey you know the epodes and

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:30.720
by the way elen take it down for a minute who is this guy elen just for those of you who who who are interested

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.840
he's kind of he's writing a work on zoology yeah he's writing a Zoological

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:42.120
work and the good thing is is his sources which there are a ton of um we

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.160
don't necessarily have those surviving anywhere else right do you see people

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:53.600
for a second do you see how big it is do you see how big it

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:59.520
is we're not looking for that scrap we're not looking for the the scraps

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:05.120
look somebody threw away an old parchment it's got a scrap a scribble we're not looking for that we're looking

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:11.520
for the stuff that was in the libraries we're looking for the stuff that the people are working with right this is

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:18.760
elen you're dealing with a major thinker of the day and I know that most of you and you shouldn't most of you don't know

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:25.440
who he is yeah yeah so zoologist just thank

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:31.919
zoologist here now we're going to watch are you ready we're getting close we're talking about two types of drugs we're

00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:37.080
talking about the drugs that you drink those are the pom right and then we're

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:45.080
talking about the drugs that youo that you Ino um that you apply otherwise and this

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:51.960
can mean to the eyes it's any other application that you are not swallowing if you there are those you

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.960
swallow and those you apply otherwise otherwise and mainlining and

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:06.000
when I say Mainline what do I mean historically some of you may absolutely

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.039
understand this and some of you may not but you are entering that

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:18.760
stream you are entering that stream you're finding that blood and pushing

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:27.720
into the blood that's mainlining yes oh God that's what Jesus

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:33.280
is doing doing it's what Jesus is doing and you say oh my God you're going to show me in

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:41.960
text in elen where Jesus I'm going to show you the Christ you cannot be Christ

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:47.399
without injecting it right into your

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:53.200
veins what yes linguistically it's gorgeous bring up the text again are you

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.559
ready let's keep reading it let's keep reading it he says what you know you can drink it or you can have it applied as

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:04.679
the Christ and he says there are incantations that are effective at kind

00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:12.480
of mollifying or softening softening what tonon many of you see that line tonon

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:18.840
because you're working on the Greek and you know that's the toxin that they use with the aerop poisons when you take

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:25.919
this thing and you increase Center it when it enters

00:20:25.919 --> 00:20:31.159
directly oh my God there is nothing

00:20:31.159 --> 00:20:39.159
better right you've got to have a mollifying drug right and he's saying the epodes

00:20:39.159 --> 00:20:45.600
help the incantations are part of it you ask yourself take it down for a second why are these people why are these

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.919
people going through incantations you see even straight up in Antiquity

oodles and oodles and oodles of author after author after author after

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:28.360

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:36.360
literary language it has died and most of the people most of the people in

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:43.200
Palestine and Judea they don't care they don't care they love Greek just fine

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.960
thank you yeah it is always a religiously

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:55.799
zealous minority historically that will come along to

00:29:55.799 --> 00:30:02.399
turn the situation to their political favor it was in the favor of that

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:08.080
religious minority to revive this dead corpse that

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:15.519
was classical Hebrew and again remember for those of you who want to travel I'm not talking about modern Hebrew modern

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:20.880
Hebrew is flourishing it's flourishing it's blossomed

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:28.840
somehow they brought life to the language in Israel yes and it's going to be happy

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:36.519
and healthy happy and health classical Hebrew oh my goodness it's a mummified

00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:42.919
corpse it's oh God it's terrible it's

00:30:42.919 --> 00:30:48.440
oh so um that's why I ask people the reason that you're not seeing in a

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:54.320
Hebrew during the time is it's dead nobody's writing in Hebrew even using

00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:01.000
Greek in the synagogues right nobody's writing in Hebrew so what where are you going to go

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.840
with the uh um where are you going to go with your sources if you're going to be

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:12.039

00:31:12.039 --> 00:31:22.200
can be holy the Bible can be correct and I can go to heaven or whatever yeah but that is the joke the

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:28.159

are poets too yeah right and nobody knows no look

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:31.480
we've got fragments from this is fantastic right Bible scholars they never touch this stuff why would they

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:36.640
never touch this stuff I don't know I'm asking genuinely

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:43.720
because I don't know it boggles my mind whenever I come across a Biblical scholar who has no

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:49.880
idea about anything outside of the New Testament I'm always shocked I'm like

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:56.960
can you claim really to be an expert in this language if all you've read is is one

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:03.800
thing out of thousands upon thousands upon thousands there's 400 pages of this text

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:11.040
that I'm showing you with these different authors different ancient authors there's 400 pages of it and there's two

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.640
to three per page two to three per page my god did

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:28.000
you know there was that many there's 500,000 copies 500,000 Scrolls in Alexandria

00:44:28.119 --> 00:44:34.240
alone yeah don't think that there aren't books all over the place right if you

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:42.119
are wealthy in Antiquity in Rome you got Scrolls you got Scrolls you send your

00:44:42.119 --> 00:44:49.119
kids to Athens why do you send them there it's for the Greek bro it's for the Greek

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:57.920
this Greek can open your brain not modern Greek modern Greek's been enslaved by the church yeah see what

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.319
happens people Julian was right we're going to lose it we're going to lose

00:45:03.599 --> 00:45:10.079
everything 30% they told me in history it's got to be 30% and it kicks over go

00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:17.119
for it a couple more and then we'll we'll oh here I just gave you yeah so D

00:45:17.119 --> 00:45:24.119
hos I just want to give you this is interesting because who is this writer of epic poetry right he's got soar in

00:45:24.119 --> 00:45:31.240
his name I just wanted you to see this got so ter in his name but um he's going to be talking about some pretty cool

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:37.400
stuff he's writing about the bards you know or you know otherwise called the

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:43.599
he's writing a diaka wait a minute what yes another you

00:45:43.599 --> 00:45:48.920
said I thought there was only one no no there's multiple right all of a sudden do you

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:56.359
realize how small a view of antiquity you've been getting you mean there are other epics other than knowest about

00:45:56.359 --> 00:46:02.200
dianis yep yeah you mean the epithets that

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:07.960
Jesus is using as Jesus Christ are all bakic

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:14.559
epithets yep you mean Hallelujah is a Greek

00:46:14.559 --> 00:46:20.200
expression yep yeah yeah you see what you have to

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:28.319
do is you have to build you have to build your own Foundation if you don't have one if all you got sand you got to

00:46:28.319 --> 00:46:33.599
build a foundation you got to put something make it work right you can't

00:46:33.599 --> 00:46:42.079
just start on the sand right he's probably gonna sink anyway right go somewhere

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:47.559
else yeah take Philo with you

00:46:47.559 --> 00:46:53.720
right Josephus was a liar he was an out andout

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:59.200
liar it's amazing people will believe anything if you write it down and of

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:04.960
course what are they all writing in Greek any who go go this is I'm sorry do

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:11.839
that do that I think it's too I think it's abusing the biblical Scholars too much can we get the excessive abusing

00:47:11.839 --> 00:47:17.839
the biblical scholar sound do we have that anywhere chewy can you key that

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:24.920
up he's already dead yeah yeah exactly

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:32.000
right come come on man you got to feel bad for them all they've got is a text that's from a defunct language that

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.720
somebody propped up and shocked a couple times the battery and it twitched

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.960
right come on man I want to show you a woman I want to show you a woman and

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:49.319
this is in response this last little bit is going to be my response to Bart Man

00:47:49.319 --> 00:47:55.200
my response to Bart Irma Bart you stepped in it you stepped in it Bart you

00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:01.599
know you did did when you said this week

00:48:01.599 --> 00:48:09.359
that people in Antiquity all thought that women were inferior to men they

00:48:09.359 --> 00:48:14.440
were not finished creations and Bart you know what you've done Bart

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:19.920
right you've taken a 2,000 year period Bart with hundreds of

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:26.000
cultures and you smash them all together under the power of Aristotle and his

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:33.240
misogyny you smashed it all together and you did that Bart because I know what you did you wiggled out from the

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:42.079
generation the generation of Scholars who were saying women did nothing in the ancient

00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:47.359
world they did nothing yeah they were

00:48:47.359 --> 00:48:54.040
chattle they were chatt sorry sorry Bart but you know as

00:48:54.040 --> 00:49:01.200
well as I do or maybe they don't teach teach you in biblical studies but you should know that a generalization like

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:07.160
that about Antiquity you never there's no generalization that you can prop up

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:14.599
right I can walk you over to the amazonians who are kicking the Athenians taals in battle and tell them hey what

00:49:14.599 --> 00:49:20.680
do you [Laughter] think you could tell Med of that but she

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:26.640
wouldn't care because she's already sending out pythas all over the planet

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:33.599
yeah yeah you got them as far west as Britany they go beyond the

00:49:33.599 --> 00:49:40.119
hisari beyond the hispes oh my God oh my God but that's

00:49:40.119 --> 00:49:48.319
okay Bart Bart I know that you can't help it because there's a certain load of stin that you have to bear within the

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:54.520
discipline I get that um but that doesn't that that

00:49:54.520 --> 00:50:00.920
doesn't mean that you aren't doing something that ah is disrespectful to

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:09.079
the Muse right classical philologists text that's what we are

00:50:09.079 --> 00:50:14.359

00:50:14.359 --> 00:50:20.440
certain amount but we don't dig in the dirt that we leave that to the archaeologist we dig through the text we

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:28.000

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:23.000
cross or an eight-pointed star or a crescent moon and usually

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.119
somebody's getting enslaved in the process and is typically

00:53:28.119 --> 00:53:34.280
women those Sisterhood of the frustration I know you I know where you

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:41.520
are yeah yeah HIPAA what beauty right you notice I

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:46.839
didn't read to you there's descriptions of her and how she looked and all that

00:53:46.839 --> 00:53:54.760
stuff right but what was beautiful about HIPAA is that her understanding of the

00:53:54.760 --> 00:54:02.119
cosmos MOS was so Superior that it made people hate her

00:54:02.119 --> 00:54:12.520
for it people who followed Yahoo you when you take a polytheistic

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:17.760
society in which Justice

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:23.520
thrives when you take that society and give a third of the people

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:31.079
power over everyone else that third can turn that Society upside down

00:54:31.079 --> 00:54:36.599
they don't have to be a majority and that's exactly what the Christians

00:54:36.599 --> 00:54:42.880
did and with the Christians having taken over the Romans right having taken over the

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:50.040
Empire and having um um mismanaged it so poorly that it was falling apart yeah

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:57.200
yeah more additional Wars nice good job um having done all of that there had to

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:05.839
be built some kind of facade of scholarship and that scholarship came through the mauretic sect which

00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:12.119
provided that source that we didn't have it finally

00:55:12.119 --> 00:55:21.440
solidified that this language is the language of God yeah yeah that's how history's built

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:27.599
and that's where you are but we're going back to that original um tonight I had a couple I think I had one or two more

00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:34.000
things but I wanted you to I wanted you to see I wanted us to end um with the

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:40.640

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:28.839
yeah yeah that's the way we we build that museum we build that museum thank

00:56:28.839 --> 00:56:35.240
