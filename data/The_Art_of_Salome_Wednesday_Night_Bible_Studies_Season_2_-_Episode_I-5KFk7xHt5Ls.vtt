00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.320
if you're being taken in the back or into a back alley or somewhere in a park where there's not a lot of people with

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.720
an academic if an academic coaxes you into some

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.920
place that's isolated always always always

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.500
rely upon reason don't take everything you're given

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.840
today I had to witness a terrible

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.660
terrible intellectual and psychical molestation

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.480
and it took place in such a Grievous and and perverted way in order to maintain

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.940
status in order to maintainism in order to maintain the great facade

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.640

little stroke you can bring them short every time with

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.459
one little stroke what was the weakness today the weakness today was the mystery

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:15.500
the mystery what happened everybody defines the mystery

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.900
and those who Define it who live the fairy tale Define it as the secret

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.420

and when you'll do when you do dig down to the depth and get to the ground the

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:47.459
scientific ground you'll see it means initiation [Music]

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.700
it means initiator one who has one who is directing

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:02.220
one who is leading the mostest is the one who is leading the initiation it is also the initiation when Jesus said I am

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:11.760

they're like black holes burned by torches in the tapestry of Tire they're

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.959
like the Black Caverns where the dragons live the Black Caverns of Egypt in which

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:54.959

I'm sure he is chased

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:29.100

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:35.760
silver his flesh must be very cold cold as ivory

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.579

Princess of Judea John back daughter of Babylon come not near the chosen of the

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.920
Lord the mother has filled the Earth with the wine your mother has filled the

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:34.740
Earth with the wine of her iniquities and the Cry of her sinning has come up

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:40.820
even to the ears of God foreign

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.839
daughter of Sodom come not near me but cover your face

00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:57.060
with a veil and Scatter ashes upon your head and get thee to the desert and seek out

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.320
the son of man

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:14.279
was it a conscious process that brought forth this right

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:21.300
or was it something of the design of a Classics design a way

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:29.820
to bring to you encapsulate a mystery if you are able to read

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:36.860
Oscar Wilde Salome and have ears to hear you will see her

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:42.060
whom the Mysteries hold as a center

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:50.459
you will see the aid alone Oscar Wilde was able to bring you the a domon

00:13:50.459 --> 00:13:56.160
the image of the queen yeah

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:02.279
yeah if you're going to sit in an ivory Tower

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:09.600
and talk about the mystery as a secret those of us who have been to the

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:15.959
sources will know that you are making things up

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:22.500
from the perspective of the detritus of the last 2 000 years

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:31.079
you are perpetuating a false world that does not exist the reality is far more

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:36.200
interesting far more interesting

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:43.380
Salome had John beheaded for a dance it was in front

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:51.000
of the king's highest generals and some visiting potentates

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.399
doesn't sound like an average party to me because it sound like an Irish party to

00:14:56.399 --> 00:15:04.500
you if you believe the Coptic sources

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:12.600
you'll know that Mary the mother of Jesus was herself

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:19.019
a priestess in the temple and you'll know that she was involved

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:24.899
with the dancing of the purple and you'll know that when the midwife

00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:31.019
insert her fingers into her vagina to palpate as any Midwife would do that's

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:36.480
practice to palpate her cervix she found out she had to remove them because they

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:43.500
burned they burned Mary is there

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:51.000
Salome is there taking the head of the Baptist yes and how does she get that head she

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.880
gets that head for a dance people don't consider

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:03.120
salome's greatest accomplishment was the silencing of a prophet

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:10.860
through her dance yeah what was she doing there

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.959
and what was it that Herod had to Grant her

00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:23.519
up to half of his kingdom because when you swear things like that in public here you know Antipas isn't the only one

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:28.800
doing this right this is a classical convention you see it all over the place early

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.620
literature the late stuff when you swear when you take an oath

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:40.680
um and it's public the ears that hear are witnesses

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:47.399
and for Herod to swear in front of these assemble these assembled important big

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:52.920
pants that he was going to give her half the kingdom

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:58.740
up to what she want he had to give her everything anything she asked for and she asked for

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:07.199
everything right in order to re-establish the rightful place of her own mother

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:12.199
who this Prophet was profaning

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:19.280
Oscar Wilde had ears to hear

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:26.900
um he recognized the sources and so that's why he can so accurately

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:34.260
label Salome the moon of the mystery she meets you in

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:40.500
the cave while you sleep yes so

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:46.620
um next time a union grabs you and takes you behind the somewhere dark

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:53.520
in an alley somewhere it doesn't matter under a bush doesn't matter wherever this jungian wants to drag you and take

00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:01.919
you and they have the guts the temerity the unmitigated brashness

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:09.539
to say shut up to say

00:18:09.539 --> 00:18:15.679
that mystery is a secret it shows you they have not yet opened the red book

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:22.200
they do not possess the Libra nois es right they don't know how to wield

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:28.559
the the serpent wand

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:36.179
of the girl who was half virgin half Viper

00:18:36.179 --> 00:18:42.419
the very images that young was possessed by

00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:48.539
when he sealed his Libra nois yes don't let them take you behind in the bushes

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:54.660
and give you something that's that's from the last two thousand years of detritus it's not reality I was talking

00:18:54.660 --> 00:19:01.380
with someone this week and I want to jump to our hymn In closing but I was talking to someone this week

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:08.039
um yes about the incident in the garden the incident in the garden and setting

00:19:08.039 --> 00:19:15.000
up the scene of that incident in the garden um and I just want to

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.039
yeah because you closed that that's a little bit rude sorry I've got teenager

00:19:20.039 --> 00:19:25.679
um that incident in the garden uh where we're talking about the setting

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:32.280
of that place remember there are three men who are standing at a distance you're detectives right there were three

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:39.000
men in a public park at 4am and there there's one guy

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.660
and there's three other guys standing in a distance from him keeping watch and they're armed because they end up when

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.880
the cops end up showing up to make the arrest with their informant they've got

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.820
their informant with them right he's gonna actually point out the leader of

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:05.580
what's going on and when they show up and that naked kid runs off and somebody pulls out a sword

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:10.679
and starts swaying at somebody I yeah somebody from the temple gets their ear

00:20:10.679 --> 00:20:18.360
cut off yeah and um we have to understand that when the prostitutes show back up at the

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:25.919
crucifixion when not even the guys who were there the enforcers would show up and the mob is crying out kill this guy

00:20:25.919 --> 00:20:31.799

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:53.160
know what all of these elements were let's turn to for the sake of our

00:20:53.160 --> 00:21:00.299
initiation let's turn to um in this Bible study today with Salome let's turn to the Divinity good thank

00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:07.860
you for bringing that up Chewie um this is an orphic hymn and I'm just opening it here myself and I'm going to

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.580
um yes there's more foreign

00:21:20.419 --> 00:21:29.520
yes I call upon the thesma for Dionysus the phasma 4 the one who brings themus

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.559

don't be surprised that I don't tell you you need to shave your beard because if you're a woman in Antiquity you don't

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:11.700
have to worry about that yeah yeah I mean don't don't get me wrong the

what they shout if you are going to enter in to the unassailable freedom

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.120
if you're going to become the initiate

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.539
if you're going to take that Rift of reality

00:28:59.539 --> 00:29:07.320
and open it up peel it back and walk into it

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:14.100
if you're going to do that um you'll have to walk the way

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:21.299
you'll have to walk the way and that won't be determined by any person there's a reason

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:27.059
did you ever notice they've got some funny stuff going on in Corinth right in

wait what um give the guy over to Satan as if it's a

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:56.940
Direction for them to execute he's not just throwing him a metaphor

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:04.260
he's telling them to perform a process to deliver that person over to the devil

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:10.799
for what why would you give some to the devil for chastisement for punishment

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:18.000
yeah for purification you have been handed over to the devil

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.880
for purification yeah yeah

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:30.240
do we end up in a dance yep we end up with a dance with Salome

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:35.279
what kind of dance was that it was a dance involving the

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:41.279
Abominations of her cop yes and the ways of Sodom

00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:48.779
yes if you don't know the ways of Sodom it's because you don't have ears to hear but there is a place

00:30:48.779 --> 00:30:53.820
that you can go and a way that will take you there

00:30:53.820 --> 00:31:00.179
um and let's go now do we have I want to take now we're done I just want to take

00:31:00.179 --> 00:31:07.200
thank you for your 30 minutes today and I'm taking it very seriously trying to keep us to that hold us to that please

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:15.919
be careful out there do not get fingered by an academic okay we need reality

00:31:15.919 --> 00:31:21.059
uh yeah because we're sworn to it right reality reason

00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:26.460
um I've kept you to your 30 minutes I'm gonna have Rob on for five to ten

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:33.980
minutes Rob tell me what do you want to to uh do with this material

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:39.240
hey so I'm gonna be cheeky and say can we get fingered by Oscar Wilde then

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:46.679
instead of the academic because yeah

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.779
you've you've taken a look at Salome you've taken along the salamate now tell

00:31:51.779 --> 00:31:58.860
me what you see in Salome coded it's it's coded to the hilt isn't

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:07.320
it how does Oscar Wilde know how to code this stuff and put it into a plate

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:12.720
that becomes something that's it's not just a small thing this isn't I mean

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:18.539
you've got like your mega stars who are obsessed with this stuff you've got Al Pacino who's

00:32:18.539 --> 00:32:24.000
he's obsessed with he's done a play he's done a film he's doing a documentary of

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.700
a play of a film he's in our day and age so he's reading

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:35.640
into this I mean how does Oscar Wilde know about the wines when he's writing this play

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.799
how does he know is to include these wines because

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:46.760
it talks about three types of wines from different areas

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:52.919
in in geography so how does he that takes either because he hasn't got the

00:32:52.919 --> 00:32:58.799
research capability we've got in his day and age and so where's he getting his information

00:32:58.799 --> 00:33:04.919
that's the that's the big thing for me he's getting his information from he kind of stay as clear of the biblical

00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:10.799
side of things and gives salami agency he's kind of

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:15.960
gets she comes to the Forefront doesn't she and she becomes the star

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:23.340
whereas it's um it's been portrayed for so long as almost like a warning the the

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:29.820
kind of the kind of message what's coming from down below through the vent from

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:38.820
from John John I mean it's John is talking apocalyptic

00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:45.559
and sauce Lindsay but that doesn't come until after

00:33:46.039 --> 00:33:51.059
the moon's turning blood red

00:33:51.059 --> 00:33:57.000
and the sun's going dark and the sun's staying into black and that that doesn't come till later on does it

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.840
if you if you look at it in a historical sense that doesn't come come till later on so why is wild including this into I

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:12.540
mean it has he been initiated essentially is where I'm going with this is as Oscar Wilde been initiated because

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:19.820
if you were if you were to ask my opinion I'd say yes I'd say it was initiated through his education

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:27.000
what do you think about his being in prison is that uh was that an initiation

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.580
um yeah I got a gas show because he's he's feeling the Wrath he's talking

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:37.618
about the dragon and feeling the wrath of disclosing information there as far as

00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:44.460
I'm concerned I think his disclosing information You've Got To Have Some balls you've got to have some balls to

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:49.858
put that kind of document out there for those where the years to ear will be

00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:55.919
listening to that document and they will know what you're saying in that document in that play you're making a play which

00:34:55.919 --> 00:35:01.500
is going to become super famous it's it's a super famous play you know in the

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:07.140
in the in the there's there's it it's just it blows my

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:12.300
mind how he can code this play and it's not a Long play

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:18.900
it's not a very long thing to comprehend and understand which filled it's absolutely filled and

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:26.400
that is what explodes out onto why you can make films about it why you can write show famous in my opinion so yeah

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:33.839
and I and I think you're correct to ask because he'd been initiated that's the same question you can ask with patchwork

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:40.079
who does everything who actually performs necromantic sortes

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:47.160
um you can ask it's why the modern Scholars on the Libra noas on Jung's book will never catch up it's why

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:52.680
they're so behind and they're so lost in it um it's because they don't understand

00:35:52.680 --> 00:36:00.599
the practice they can't comprehend that practice um so they'll talk about the symbols but

00:36:00.599 --> 00:36:06.359
they'll entirely miss the the mystery in which those symbols sit again they don't

00:36:06.359 --> 00:36:12.000
have ears young says that he seals the book where break the seal then right can

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.700
they no they can and they won't break the seal right because why not no

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:25.440
respect for the muse no respects for the Muse was Oscar Wilde able to circumvent whatever it was

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.859
that's stopping the head of the great organizations of the world academically

00:36:30.859 --> 00:36:36.119
was was Oscar Wilde able to circumvent it yeah he was able to go from the

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:42.720
outside he remained a guardian or a dragon of those texts and he used all

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:48.420
the images that those texts contain um just like patriarch

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:53.640
um just like boccaccio um I would say just like Prova did as

00:36:53.640 --> 00:37:00.060
far back as like fourth Century um did by protecting protecting the

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:05.460
mystery and um using listen to The Genius of this woman she she used Virgil

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:11.880
to write the um New Testament to write the story of

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.980
Jesus she used Virgil and when you think about that's that's

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:24.300
phenomenal it's it's not even in our brains to be able to say I couldn't take if I was a musician I couldn't take

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:31.680
Beethoven a Mozart and somebody else and excerpt from them something to create a

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:38.940
symphony that sounded um gorgeous as if it's original work and yet she is

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:45.900
just using the elements how is she able to do that because she understands the mystery and how it functions they call

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:51.420
her they have to call her a Christian because of it right it's that powerful

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:56.579
so um if you want to function in the world that we're still that we're in with this

00:37:56.579 --> 00:38:03.660
myth and this fairy tale that we're perpetuating fine I'd rather be with those people like Prova who have opened

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:09.540
up the reality and are masters of it that's yeah yeah so did Wild was wild

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:17.700
initiated I can um I I would just say that he was he uses the Dragon element yeah he does he

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:22.859
preserves the song but I would say no more so than the Templars no more so

00:38:22.859 --> 00:38:29.700
than any uh than Michelle or Mike morulis marilis how does Mike morulis

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:37.980
write perfect cult poetry perfect hymns to be used in rights how does he orphic

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:43.920
rights how does he do that um when he's living it's like in the

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:50.400
Latin then sucks anyway it's terrible so how does he how does he go back are these dragons preserving I don't know

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:57.540
any word from arto on this any yeah deep in the middle of all this yeah

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:04.440
that's um I'm still on I'm still on Research in Auto and I'm going to bring you some

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:10.619
more information but yeah it was he went to Ireland thinking there was an apocalypse about

00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:15.720
trapping he actually just he made it all the way to Ireland with no money

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:22.619
whatsoever he just used um a letter from a from an official as currency to get to Ireland

00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:28.140
and when he got to Ireland nobody could understand him nobody could figure out

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:35.099
what what he was saying because he didn't speak Gaelic he didn't speak English and they didn't speak French so

00:39:35.099 --> 00:39:40.619
he really struggled so uh what I'd like to do is offer more information as to

00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:46.740
why he went there and where and what happened to him when he come back so I don't want to

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:54.020
go too early on that I'd like to give a more detailed account and I'm really going to reset appreciate John that

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:59.579
good and you're going to be talking to us a little bit about his magic too and some things you found out and he was

00:39:59.579 --> 00:40:05.460
trying to protect someone great yeah I've got to make amends there because I

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:12.720
I have presented um a spell on on the last Bible studies I presented

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:20.760
a spell that I interpreted as a death threat and I've recently got more information

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:26.400
on that and it's not a death threat what it is is a protection spell

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:32.940
and I'm trying to piece together and figure out the metaphoric basis of how

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:40.380
you say to somebody I'll send you the force of death in a protection Manner and somebody

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:46.859
commented on YouTube Somebody commented after and said I don't think it's a death threat and that made me Shack and

00:40:46.859 --> 00:40:54.359
guess myself which is a good thing I enjoy second guessing I don't mind being mistaken and wrong and I'll certainly

00:40:54.359 --> 00:41:02.040
address anything like that such as another one I'm not very good at this am I because he says Mary beard as far as I

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:07.440
can tell but the the English accent would be different on that but then

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:13.560
yeah she it it's um it's not a death threat what he sent in

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:19.260
this poor Sophia mossey was I think she was Jewish and I think

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:27.420
she was taken off in occupied occupied French German occupied France and she was taken off which like

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:35.339
I said I'd prefer offer a bit more detail Isn't it nice to have a an extremely

00:41:35.339 --> 00:41:42.780
