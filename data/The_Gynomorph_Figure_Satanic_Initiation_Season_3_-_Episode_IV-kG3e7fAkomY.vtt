00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:09.389
[Music]

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.380
never said anything I meant I never sent the letters that I should have said the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.569
choice [Music]

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.140
never was a cause for a long never knew what I was talking about anyway

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.440
[Music] welcome back to Lady Babylon it's good

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.600
to see you again you can see at the start of this satanic initiation I've

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.600
already got my glasses on which means we're gonna jump right into syntax

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.960
um and hopefully hit you with some images to bring you to that place

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.939
where you can see those deep things those deep things of Satan nice nice uh

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.320
tonight on lady Babylon we'll be taking a look at hermaphrodites we'll be taking a look at

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.240
the worship of them and why that is the source of Christianity

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:38.170
[Music]

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.000
I wanted to give you just a little portrayal tonight of what um I've encountered and I want to give

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.060
you a little background we're going to be looking at a source tonight that I've I've gotten the permission of the author

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.399
which is me and we're going to go through a little bit of hermaphrodites

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.000
gynamorse and Jesus just a bit of the intro and a little commentary a little running commentary

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.940
on it so think of it as a way for an author to be able to tell you what's

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.980
behind the text for those of you with ears to hear

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.680
fantastic I want to start tonight

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.819
I want you to settle in and I want you to take a look at religion

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.040
religion is a wormhole it is a multi-dimensional collapsible

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.500
bridge in space that only a 13 year old girl in the bloom of Life can open

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.140
and only when she has entered a state of heightened sexual arousal

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.660
when I started writing this I was privileged to be able to work with an

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.420
editor who uh just an outstanding author he had been looking at my writer

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.239
outstanding writer he'd been looking at my work and the chemical Muse had come

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.519
out with Ellen and he wanted to be able

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.540
to bring the material to the public without all of the footnotes

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:26.159
yeah so he said we're going to incorporate our quotations to within the text to drive it forward so that people

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:34.680
aren't taken aback because I had a tendency to overly yeah you know academically

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.120
trained you always want to put your footnotes down in your sources so this is an attempt to bridge that Gap

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.340
yeah according to ancient Etruscan symbols

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.700
the teenage priestesses who established the norms for much of Roman culture

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.519
religion is a method of cosmic tunneling it's a practice that creates a fluid

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:06.360
structure through which Dark Matter breathing beings can travel in order to

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.799
possess their maddened devotees the ancient world believed religion was

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:20.880
a resonant span across the fabric of space-time and ancient clerics

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.919
taught that it's thermodynamic seal could be forcefully broken open with the

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:33.419
songs of Maidens people are are always talking about what

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.020
religion is and when we look at religion and Antiquity we're looking through our modern lens

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.660
Christianity of Antiquities nothing even remotely similar to what you see today

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.020
so when we're looking at texts that have to do with strange Concepts we have to be careful we have to be very

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.500
literate we have to insist upon a scientific approach this is all from reason right

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:05.419
the Romans spoke classical Latin their word religio

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.800
from which we derive our English word religion means ligature or binding

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.100
this is important religion is not what you think it is modern historians overly influenced by their own Christian

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.139
cultural lands have interpreted this to mean religion is something that binds us

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.720
to do and to say certain things in celebration of divinity

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.320
in other words religion is what we owe the god or the Gods

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.340
nothing could be further from the historical actuality let's get out and taste the air a little bit in Rome

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.880
religio was simply the cosmic tie that bound the Earth plane to the rest of the

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.100
Multiverse it was a means to an end it was a force

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:03.120
of extra dimensional attraction yeah yeah

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:11.160
let's talk about demons let's talk about demons I want you to be getting in the place of the ancient

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:18.240
practitioner the importance of demons the ancient Mediterranean World taught

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:25.560
the priestesses witches diviners and Poets possess the ability to open portals

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.919
through which sentient powers or demons who inhabited extra worldly planes could

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:37.680
travel to the material universe these beings these powers that be did

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.259
not have a physical form and remember we can go through all of the scientific

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:49.319
texts we can go through all the Aristotle we want we can go through all the talking about Democritus we can go

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:56.280
through all the traditional Greek ways of learning right to support what this is saying are

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:03.180
you ready these beings these powers that be did

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.419
not have a physical form they were not composed of atoms

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:17.039
they were not composed of atoms the indivisible elements of our world that's ancient it's not modern and they

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:23.220
did not have eyes ears mouths voices or in fact any human or biological attribute at all

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.560
and perhaps most importantly these Immortals were neither male nor female

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.160
they were neither and they were both

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.080
in the Greco-Roman way of thanking gods are cosmic or the cosmic bloom

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.300
of existence which only makes sense right it only makes sense that the

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.300
Divinity would be that moment at which the Perfection is displayed

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.940
yes you see how everything goes back to Aphrodite love it and the greco-runner

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:03.139
way of thanking God to the cosmic Bloom Greek and Latin culture preserved in the Amber of ancient literature

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:08.419
perpetuated The View that gods are the immortal elements

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:15.000
of an ordered and living universe they are the elements of an ordered and

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.400
living Universe the orphics prayed to that Cosmos

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.580
that organization which they called foosis nature

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.219
nature and you see right away why Paul the Apostle is so angry

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:38.700
and running around saying stop worshiping nature get your mind off of nature because even the Christians who

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:45.660
had entered the cult we're still influenced by their upbringings by their education

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:54.140
yeah and if they didn't have any of that they had what was in The Ether around them

00:08:55.019 --> 00:09:01.800
myth was the medium in which the classical World expressed the efflorescence of the immortal forces of

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.839
the universe Greek and Roman myth had an extraordinary influence on Ancient

00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:13.080
artists Statesmen religious leaders and philosophers it was a cultural cement

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.959
that facilitated the construction of democracy the establishment of a system of

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:25.860
Education and the creation of what became the scientific method

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:32.820
ancient meth was a metaphor for expressing the individuality and actions of the immortal powers that govern the

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:38.880
universe there was no difference between their philosophers

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:45.899
and their physicists there was no difference the doctors had to stand on both sides

00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:51.839
of that divide the doctors had to had to know the pharmacology they had to know which

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:59.459
drugs did what but they also had to know the theories that Galen goes into ad nauseam

00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:06.000
yes the medical theories and the medical Powers the powers of things yes

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.820
so a lot of this talk about demons fits right in with their religion

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:17.580
which is very different when you talk about a mystery and the performance of a mystery and antiquity

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:24.899
you're talking about a specific event for which you cannot create a proper

00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:32.820
representation using modern terms you can't you can't you have to go there the goal

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:38.820
is the orgasm yeah and you say wait a minute wait what I didn't think church had anything to do

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:44.279
with orgasm right

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:50.399
that's why they threw out Aphrodite that's why they threw out Aphrodite they

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:59.040
severed that connection within the mystery and from that point on you have a terrible terrible enslavement of the

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:07.399
feminine gorgeous I want to read you one another section here I'm going to skip ahead

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.140
I just want to read to you about the bigender God the by gender God the

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:18.839
gynomorph was a bigender god with both masculine and physic and feminine attributes

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:24.779
the word itself is just a pairing of Guyana a woman and morph shape literally

00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:31.740
a gynomorph is a god with female shape traditionally the gynomorph was a was a

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:37.440
developed or evolved

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.459
state of feminine Divinity or Diamond demon in English

00:11:43.459 --> 00:11:48.959
were portrayed as effeminate young males like Dionysus these are the ones they're

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:56.519
outlawing in China right now right they're trying to get rid of effeminate males by the way this I hope that this

00:11:56.519 --> 00:12:02.760
YouTube live is banned in Tennessee I hope it's

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.800
banned in Tennessee ganymorphs retain the creative capacity

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:14.279
of their feminine forms they had Cosmic wombs but they also

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:19.920
possessed the inseminating abilities attributed to the masculine God

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.800
yeah gyne morphs were special because they stood in the gender gap between

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:31.560
male and female Gods got a more formed a bridge between the Sexes they were a

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:37.200
combo or the sum of both genders yeah

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.839
in this way God of Wars were hermaphroditic and could appear sometimes as predominantly masculine or

00:12:42.839 --> 00:12:48.660
other times as predominantly feminine the gynomorph was an important figure in

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:54.000
ancient culture because the Greco-Roman world and I'm going to say something that's going to

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.700
shock you and you're not going to believe until I show you examples or until you find examples and come back

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:07.680
to me and say you're right the Greco-Roman World possessed no word

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.800
for gender they also didn't possess a word for

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:21.720
homosexuality that's a later creation it's only it's only when you persecute something can

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.880
you name it and identify it if something is not persecuted it doesn't need to be

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.100
identified it's just part of society and that's how the Greeks were you

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:38.760
remember Achilles right there's no question that he was involved with men and women

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:45.480
right there's no reference to what that ism is it doesn't exist

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:52.519
I'll give you a clue though the Christians created one

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:58.200
the monotheistic religions always come up with a way

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:06.240
with the way of taking that group of people and uh uh and defining them

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.060
and vilifying them they throw the drug drug users in there with them right

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:18.120
that's the way it is lovely Universe you've got say those who

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:24.600
are watching they viewed sex not as a binary proposition but as a natural sum of two

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:31.079
Cooperative potentials isn't that interesting yeah it's not binary

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:37.200
it's not binary at all yeah right nice it's a range it's a

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:43.380
scale which makes sense because the Greeks were such such students of balance

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:50.760
such students of balance that was mesmeric Chewie thanks for that video in their view sexual attributes were a

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:56.940
combination of both masculine and feminine qualities there were no absolute sexual characteristics or

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:02.699
combinations for this reason closest word uh their closest word to English

00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:08.820
gender is kind kind that's about the closest you can

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:14.760
get kind yeah yeah fantastic

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:22.079
what are the origins of necromancy and what does this have to do was necromancing because that's why

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:30.000
everybody's come here is to get involved in necromancy right so at least that's what you're especially seems to be reflecting

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.459
the earliest origins of Western necromancy are found in the practices of

00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:43.440
Etruscan priestesses and Prophets these wates or Sears were able to Divine

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:49.320
the future based on their reading of natural signs they believed Cosmic

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:56.459
intelligence is freely communicated with Mortals and they thought that proper interpretation of signs like lightning

00:15:56.459 --> 00:16:01.920
strikes in the flight of birds was the provenance of specialized clerics

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:07.519
these same clerics worship gyneamorphic Gods there we are there's the connection

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:14.639
and perpetuated myths of bigendered divine entities by General Divine

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:21.120
entities necromancy was extremely popular during birth and early development of

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:29.579
Christianity raising the dead was a common practice of Roman and Greek religious figures and

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:34.680
was a well-established ritual by the time Jesus entered the stage of

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:40.079
Western history necromancers perform sacred sexual acts

00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:46.100
meant to summon and drive out demons from The Afflicted

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:51.839
sacrapyakia is the Latin term so for those of you who say I need a source and

00:16:51.839 --> 00:17:00.899
I need There's an actual that you don't get better evidence than this an actual word in Latin for sacred sodomy

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:06.298
think about that for a minute This Is Not Unusual because in Roman weddings in

00:17:06.299 --> 00:17:13.260
Roman weddings when your 14 year old girl is marrying a 30 year old ex-veteran

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:22.140
um it's traditional for her to be able to offer the anus as a alternative to

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:27.418
vaginal penetration right it's it's a courtesy

00:17:27.419 --> 00:17:32.940
because uh it's a scary process and

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:38.580
um the Romans thought it was uh it should be up to her to choose and when she's ready

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:44.760
she will offer the other but until then just you know yeah that's the way it's

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:51.240
going to be and Saint Augustine hated this he hated it he was so much against this practice

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:57.240
right and he said they go up during the wedding and they sit they sit on the

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:02.400
phallus they sit on the priapus yeah it was uh

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:10.440
um as soon as you can call them sodomites you've got it you've got a group that you can latch onto and you

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.660
can burn the city down for right isn't that what we all desire

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:20.880
yeah his first century Christians we got a burn down Rome that's what they

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.340
said people now are calling for civil war right there's this happens through

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.740
history there are forces that call for the decline for the toppling of the government

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:37.200
and the Romans the Romans fought that Force they fought it hard they pushed

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.840
for civilization they pushed for it and it was only it was only when the

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:50.039
Christians took the extra step everybody everybody I'm telling you we've been reading these texts a long time and

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:55.320
everybody thinks the fairy tale is the actuality they think the Romans are

00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.660
walking around with their regalia on stomping around their uniforms putting

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:06.660
people on crosses throwing people to the Tigers yeah letting people get killed

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:12.900
you know the only time they took on the Christians and put them in the arena with other criminals

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:18.660
is when they stood against the government when they stood against the government

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:24.780
right the Romans didn't care who Jesus was they didn't give anything this was

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:31.860
some Backwater province that was way out of control that had no tradition that

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:37.740
even came close to the what the Romans considered civilization these people

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:44.039
don't have toilets bro they don't have toilets right much less how do you get there the

00:19:44.039 --> 00:19:49.320
roads are terrible the roads are they got no Administration they get nothing

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:57.299
their courts are terrible you can be stoned by a crowd of people this is Hillbilly world right this is

00:19:57.299 --> 00:20:03.600
they didn't care about so and so the greatest King in the world they didn't care about that right it's

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.240
when the Christians stood against the government when the insurrections started

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:15.539
right when the violence started right and that inevitably it was

00:20:15.539 --> 00:20:22.260
catapult to everybody forward in time to a place where the uh the Romans get

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:28.740
swamped and there's people who try to stop it along the way there's intellectuals

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:38.640
there's people who were government people who try to stop it see if we can keep this keep this insurrectionist mood

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:44.100
out right preserve the Republic you don't go in and defecate

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:49.620
on the Statue of the Republic you wild animals

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:55.380
yeah yeah those are the ones you feed to the Tigers

00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.660
right Thomas Jefferson got this Thomas Jefferson got this when he said you have to take

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:06.780
the leader of the Insurrection that Tyra and you gotta sacrifice him to Liberty

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:13.500
you got to sacrifice him if you don't Justice doesn't stay with you she leaves and once Justice leaves your Society

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:21.299
you're done for you're done for those are classical ideas classical ideas

00:21:21.299 --> 00:21:29.460
yeah I want to continue the origin of necromancy I'm sorry the purpose of ancient Western religion was to open a

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.620
means of communication with the Realms of the Gods classical necromancers

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:41.760
practice their religion by opening portals to the kingdom of the Dead the oldest civils the earliest Western

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.860
prophets and these are the sybils of the Vatican Hill baby right these are these

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:53.220
are the real ones the ones you were saying listen up and you're so serious Jew uh is John litis they're saying

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:59.460

00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:13.380
that you're going to want to keep it in a vault you're going to want to keep it a treasury yeah serious stuff

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:19.799
all of them women Moses is bound to the iraqiar tradition

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:27.360
otherwise he wouldn't be holding up a serpent on a pole you wouldn't have a tent full of clouds

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:33.059
they got to put a rope on your leg why do they put a rope on your leg you say when you're going to the temple that's

00:22:33.059 --> 00:22:39.240
weird isn't that weird because they're gonna have to pull you out if you collapse right with all that with

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:44.580
everything that God on the altar yeah what do you think you burn on altars not on meat

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:51.780
right lots of drugs and Antiquity lots of drugs

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:56.880
the oldest sybils the earliest Western prophets taught that the resurrection

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:04.200
of summoning of the that the resurrection or summoning of the Gods from the underworld was a necessary step

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:10.380
in restoring Justice to the universe you have the final judgment

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:18.240
and some of you will talk about the final judgment seat of Christ the Christians will talk very pompously

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:24.020
yes judgment seat of Christ I'm a dominionist

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:31.080
pre-tribulationalist millennialist masturbatorius Maximus

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:38.039
um it's just so much humiliating Circle jerkery this performed theologians love

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:44.820
it but this idea of this judgment was because and you'll love this people it's

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:51.419
because the generation of iron they called us they called us the generation of iron

00:23:51.419 --> 00:24:01.820
the last God says Greek mind the last God to leave Mortals

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:12.059
Justice she left the generation of iron because she saw that she had no place

00:24:12.059 --> 00:24:17.640
she was the last God to leave she hung in there as long as she could but as

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:23.159
soon as you say what happened well what happened to the justice system

00:24:23.159 --> 00:24:29.640
money happened to the justice system money happened to the justice system and

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.860
those Greeks knew as soon as you get money you get the corruption of democracy

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:43.380
the corruption of democracy those gods that help protect you like Athena Nikkei

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.500
the Virgin we all protect that virgin democracy

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:54.539
Justice we all protect Justice we all want to preserve Justice right if we

00:24:54.539 --> 00:24:59.940
don't sacrifice to Justice we're not going to keep our society that's it and

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.820
we're going to be we're going to be hit with things um that we don't have the defenses for

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:11.940
right this is why we call those Gods here it's why we have these specific

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:18.179
Gods remember the Christians first called uh the Christians were first called

00:25:18.179 --> 00:25:24.240
atheists by the pagans because they said you have no Gods you have no justice how

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.340

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:50.400
to be a falling away the root

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.500
the root is the Love of Money says justice right long established before
