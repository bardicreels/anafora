comments on YouTube and have even seen some crop up in the lives I've been watching all the previous

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.860
streams and pretty much caught up at this point I'd also like to re-watch because there is so much material and a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.000
lot of it is over my head like when people comment about almond getting political and telling him to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.580
stay in his Lane that really pisses me off everything is political especially

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.000

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:07.920
did find the reference to the expression dragon in the breast my English translation of Clemens protus reads the

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:16.440
deity Gliding Over the breast for the token of the sebasian Mysteries to the initiated however however you like that

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:22.619

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:59.099
um being and we can look at her cathartic work

00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:05.220
and her magic right but what we're focusing on now

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:11.960
is we are supposed to go back with Jesus to that place in Uganda

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:20.720

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:30.900
they need this event yeah why they don't realize it it's based on things that were around when

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:36.000
they weren't um but that's that's how we are isn't it

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.820
that's what I tell them that's what I tell the Watchers I mean I'm like dude okay I know I know they're going to be

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:48.300
surprised again right they're going to be surprised again but um there's nothing we can do about

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:53.940
it there's nothing we can do about it because we're not here for them anyway we're here for Eve right we're here for

00:40:53.940 --> 00:41:03.359
Eve I want to leave you with the impression there is an ideal out there that we can

00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:11.400
reach toward that you can take the Human Experience

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:18.180
and you can tune it you can tune it to create a sphinx

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:25.020
you can tune it to create she who can tell you past and future all at present

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:32.099
you can tune that world it's in the genes it's in the nature it's inherent

00:41:32.099 --> 00:41:38.960
it's inherent all we have to do is follow

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:46.440
yeah yeah there's no Bell

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:53.099
for the next person who realizes the applications and

00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:59.339
realizes just what exactly they were doing in Antiquity when they were making these you know tiny computers that

00:41:59.339 --> 00:42:04.859
