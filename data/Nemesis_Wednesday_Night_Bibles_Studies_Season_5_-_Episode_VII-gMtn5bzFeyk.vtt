[Music]

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.560
in order to begin with the foundation and root of everything

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.240
Pagan that which those who worship the gods worship I want to bring you DK tonight I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.880
want to bring you you justice and I want to say she is the last she is the last

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.319
of the divinities to aband in Mortal Society if you drive her out you do so

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:21.200
to your own Peril now this is a very very Pagan thing that angered the pagans

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:31.760
because the Christians and the Jews did not respect the Gods

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:39.400
they were not devotees of dekay if you are unwilling to offer

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.440
yourself to Justice you do not belong as

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.640
a part of civilized society say the Romans you must honor

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.239
Justice perfect for our circumstances the time shall we play a little video

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.200
something that brings the future and the past together into one coherent message

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.519
Che we hit it it's really about realizing that uh

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:23.480
walking in humility uh surrendering everything to my heavenly father who ultimately is uh the one who uh directs

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.599
uh what I do hopefully each and every day uh and and then lastly I think the

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:37.120
the big part of that is is realizing that the credit for any victories are not mine uh they belong to uh uh to the

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.129
guy that I serve [Music]

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:58.549

every word out of your mouth is accounted for every word let us see

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:46.960
Nemesis brought to the four of our discussion tonight let us see

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.000
Nemesis why it is that she is so important when you strip back all the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.199
gods when you strip back all the hopes and joys and all the trappings of

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:03.240
civilization when you strip all that away you're still left with a foundation and

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.840
that Foundation is Nemesis we honor Nemesis in that there's

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.240
a little bit of Greek in that video untranslated yes and that little bit of

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.639
Greek said that the one who bends the knee to Nemesis the one who acknowledges

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:30.600
Nemesis is the wise one yeah what is nemesis is doing and

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.720
why is she so important I want to bring you this Oracle And as we're doing so

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.919
we're doing so against the background of Nemesis Nemesis was worshiped as one of

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.720
those foundational deities one of those forces that you

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.039
cannot come through this life without having encountered whether you want to

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:04.639
declare yourself a monotheist and say there are are no Gods there is no justice there is no

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.240
retribution there is only Allah there is only

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.720
Jehovah Yahoo and his son who was arrested in a

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:22.400

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.479
pagan origins of civilization as you and I sitting here

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:39.560
here today in the 21st century know it we must reconsider for one moment

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.720
Nemesis for without her we have no justice and when Justice leaves that's

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:52.000
it that's it we're all done let's go to the uh before we bring up the

where there are more than two human beings gathered together in

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:11.039
society there is a place for the Ohad oh

00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:19.640

an instant when you see her you come to the Oracle she knows who you are what

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:32.200
how how do she I don't know people talk she knows who you are and she knows what

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:40.519
you're going to do just like she knows what you did do this is a person yes this is not a

00:30:40.519 --> 00:30:46.720
mythological creature this is a woman how

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:53.000
exciting with all of those brain centers everything that is beautiful in

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.639
nature brought to fruition do you wonder now why Christianity that

00:30:59.639 --> 00:31:06.240
developed after the first century had to sanitize itself do you wonder why they

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:12.519
had to say take out the ban the plants from the communion drink stop using

00:31:12.519 --> 00:31:17.600
those right what about the orgies what about

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:24.480
the orgies if you're a Christian like 120 130 you're like who can we still do

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:31.360
the orgy thing I mean it's kind of the whole purpose right I

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:38.320
mean isn't that why they all get together it's a fundamental shift in Christianity not to be involved and for

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:46.000
the Orthodox and for the experts for the

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.279
fundamentalist yeah guess what all your religions are based upon this very

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:58.320
mystery action yes your cult whether it's Moses or Jesus

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:04.279
or Muhammad all of them all of the things

00:32:04.279 --> 00:32:12.320
that come from the book all of the zealots all the monks all the priests all the sobs that took witches and

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:18.480
burned them alive they all come from a mystery that

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:24.559
is satanic and involves sex drugs death

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:29.080

see tonight was Nemesis so I'm gonna play that first clip one more time and I

00:42:10.839 --> 00:42:19.720
want you to realize who she is who Nemesis is when everything else

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:27.359
fails retribution comes it's really about realizing that

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:36.480
uh walking in humility uh surrendering everything to my heavenly father who ultimately is uh the one who uh directs

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:41.599
uh what I do hopefully each and every day uh and and then lastly I think the

00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:50.200
the big part of that is is realizing that the credit for any victories are not mine uh they belong to uh uh to the

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:58.160
God that I serve [Music] yes

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:35.920

to avert something that you have said that goes

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:52.880
beyond something that shows your lack of respect for Nemesis

00:43:52.880 --> 00:44:00.359
I a politician am led by

00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:07.160
