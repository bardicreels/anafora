00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.760
thank you for joining me again I just want to say how nice it is to be

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.799
able to sit and cover it with with a group like you are I've been watching

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.640
your comments and I appreciate them I noticed that several people are talking about their conversations with Lucifer

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.000
and I think it's important for us to work in your testimony

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.119
so I will be determining a format to do that on so um don't let your words of

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.439
inspiration be lost we need to bring together the congregation uh with

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.200
our witness of Lucifer fantastic

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.600
um tonight we're going to look at Zoe's tree I want to jump right into things

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.840
and I know that you're excited and I know that you've looked at some of the background and that these are not brand

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.220
new sources for you and a lot of you out there are ready but I'm gonna trip you

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.439
up and I'm going to bring you something that you probably haven't considered and

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.459
this is a document that is part of a collection of

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.640
Greco-Roman magical papyri discovered from Egypt and you know

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.239
somebody's somebody's garbage heap um yeah and these are fantastic excerpts

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.360
from the first century BC to anno domini

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.879
uh fourth fourth Century roughly somewhere in that range it's a range of

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.580
material and if you're really really good with the Greek you can distinguish

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.840
between which texts are earlier and which year later so how do we how do we get here and what does this have to do

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.280
with the tree of Zoe So if we're going to find the tree of Zoe you have to be

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.180
within the garden and so today we're gonna go meet someone

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.000
who works in the garden yeah he is called a root cutter

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.379
but he has a very specific method for

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:23.159
um harvesting the diamones the powers of

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:30.480
the plants and uh it's very it's a beautiful kind of mixture of religion

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.420
and botany and chemistry and oracular

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.959
vision all in one um I call it the spirit of almond not because I am almond

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.000
but because that is what the text calls itself

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.319
it is the spirit of Amen it's nice um let's go let's just go there now for our

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.260
initial text could you call up the spirit of Almond please

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.840
yeah yeah um here's the Greek so I just want to

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.780
show you I'll be working I'll be working with um yeah pull that down

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.739
um just by way of introduction I worked with John Scarborough at University of Wisconsin-Madison in the history of

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.880
Pharmacy and um I was in the classics Department there and he did the medical side so in

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:34.440
addition to Medicine he did the drugs he did a lot of research on the drugs and he was a translator for the modern the

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.620
only modern Edition in English that exists of these magical papyri yeah of

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.680
these magical papyri and that's the Hans Dieter bets Edition anyway John

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.320
Scarborough was one of those translators and um yeah we had a lot of fun we had a

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.560
lot of fun talking about the nuances of the Greek and how hard it is to translate in some of these texts it's

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.080
brilliant stuff but uh uh uh that's how we get to these texts in the first place

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.919
and so we're there we're going to bring I'm going to bring you a root cutter um when somebody told me when the head

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:17.280
of the department at University of Wisconsin told me that the Romans just

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:25.500
wouldn't do such a thing with the drugs right they just wouldn't do such a thing um I started looking and I'm trying to

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.960
break through to a populace of people that I think is now the time to break

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.120
through they're beginning to see the value of these drugs in medicine so

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.900
we're experiencing really a psychedelic Renaissance right get our drugs banner up there yes it's a psychedelic

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.620
Renaissance so I'm taking you back to somebody who was there

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.919
who was collecting and using drugs in ritual

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:02.340
um yes the Romans would do such a thing and they did such a thing a lot and why

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:09.539
don't we know this as moderns why is it that Harvard keeps fingering us right why do they keep doing this

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:15.600
um because these texts are not they're hard right you're going to have some Botanical knows you're gonna have some

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.660
medical knowledge you have to it it's a it's too much science and so it's much

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:29.720
easier if you're at Harvard to read Homer than it is to read some obscure

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.759
magical author who may be composing and beautiful

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:42.000
dactylic Sandler but you're just you just don't want to go there and they're going to start going there a professor

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.340
told me Professor from Brown told me it would take 10 years so I want to take

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.639
you ahead to that place where that Gardener is and I want to look at that

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:59.759
gardener so let's just pull up I'm going to pull up the Hans Dieter bets now our

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:07.080
translation by O'Neill I think this was done um they don't they don't translate uh

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.979
um the word root cutter I'll show you it in the text um he translates it herbalist uh the

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:19.380
word is literally a root cutter what is a root cutter these are weird weird

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.599
people right root Cutters are the ones that go out and they paint their bodies

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:30.840
and they perform nocturnal rituals right where they harvest

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:39.000
where they harvest their drugs and they imbue their drugs with the life of the dime

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.479
mode yeah it's it's an it's another one of these if you're a ghost you understand

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:52.319
it um it's another one of these art that this Arts that the sons of God passed on

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:57.360
um to their offspring yeah this Pharma case right

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.660
um yeah this sorcery so I'm giving you original sorcery and it wants to look at

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:10.080
this guy the root cutter and tell him how we get to the tree of Zoe we have to

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:15.419
be facing edim all right we have to be facing Adam so I

00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:21.120
want you to face her mentally in these images that we're about to run through

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.580
but let's before he his cadaver gets too cold let's pull him out here and let's

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:33.000
get him uh on the show can you bring up the Hans Dieter bet tax place in the

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.700
English thank you yeah I want to read this one is that I'm

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:44.820
sorry let me just yes there we go so I'm going to read this to you and I'm going to stop a couple of times and make a

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:50.040
couple of comments from the Greek things that are relevant

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.440
um yeah so let's go gorgeousness and gorgeousity and you

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:02.160
know in order to get there we need to go through the Dark Harbor so um I will show you the the dark Harbor's

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:10.320
relevance in just one minute but let's read together shall we among the Egyptians herbs are always obtained like

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:18.019
this the herbalist there's our root cutter the herbalist first first

00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:24.000
purifies his own body first he Sprinkles with Natron

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.200
and fumigates the herb with resin from a pine tree after carrying it around the

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:37.800
place three times burning kifi and pouring the libation of

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:46.260
milk as he prays he pulls up the plant while invoking by name the diamond to

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:53.760
whom the herb is being dedicated isn't that nice and calling upon him to

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:00.060
be more effective for the use for which is being acquired so this is this is

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:06.899
somebody that we're collecting you know we're in the process of collecting plants all right we're hanging out with

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:12.360
somebody who now has a vast Botanical knowledge and knows what plants do what

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:21.920
to you and on top of that we've put on this this um Natron right which is just sodium

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.959
bicarbonate right it's just uh it's just baking soda

00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:33.720
yeah and anyway but for some reason when we're using ourselves to these plants

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.880
and you see this a lot with the different root Cutters you can find other root Cutters other places

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:45.839
um you need to know this Sophocles Sophocles was writing he wrote a Trilogy

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:51.779
one of the titles of which is the root cutters so this is a fantastically important

00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:56.820
area in Antiquity euripides mother is one of these root cutters

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:03.000
yeah a rhizotomist if you want to use the term that comes directly from the

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.060
Greek good the risotto Moy the root Cutters is an entire play so uh um we

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:16.860
have this individual this occupation who is getting himself uh ready to collect

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:23.640
these plants and to and to be able to hold and uh what's he going what's he going

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:31.320
to do look at the invocation that comes up he speaks over any herb generally at the

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:36.360
moment of picking um is as follows right now here we go

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:42.300
here's the part if you're performing if you're involved in the saturnian magic

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:51.060
or if you're performing satanic magic you are now entering the images

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.880
in order to unlock the potential of the diamond

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.160
you have to have these things in your head it's quantum physics do I

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.920
understand it no the Sybil in uh on the Vatican set you

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:15.420
have to tr work or trust the allegory right right that's what's

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:21.480
that's what's uh that's how it works okay so sit with the image what images you were

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:26.700
sewn by Kronos um why don't you I'm going to read this and I want you to bring up the images

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:34.320
please you were sewn by Kronos nice you were sown by Kronos and that

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:40.500
word for sound there is literally to um throw the seed at right to implant

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:45.779
the seed right so cross is the seed implanter

00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:52.079
yeah you were conceived and it it is an excellent translation it is conception

00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:59.040
literally right because look at the line below we'll have birth so these are different images that

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.220
you're creating who is the one who conceives

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:12.839
right with her son Ares and how does she work she works through Venus what yes

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:18.899
she works through the curses the Ari okay just just hang on you weren't there

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:25.560
but now you're coming to the meetings you can start to hear the names you're going to start to know the images so I

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:31.079
need you to have the image of Kronos and I need you to have the image of Hera

00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:41.040
right Hera is the queen of Queens and Cronus as the power of the degrading

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:48.360
um Power of time yeah love that the corrosive

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:55.800
yeah beautiful anyway you were maintained and why Chronos because we're saturnians brah we're here right we're

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.800
here for the sake of Satan right or saturnus right very good

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:11.459
um the Str some of you in the comments tonight you were talking about Ishtar and ass start the Str inanna 273 in

00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:20.880
there as well the uh great comments the um Str root or the sigma Tau row root I

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:27.779
will argue is Greek it is Mycenaean it's where we get our word sottera you know

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:33.380
savior um um salvation it's the word we get

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:38.820
Historia from the word the inquiry that we ask in Oracle the question is the

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:43.980
history right it's the it's the root we get oysteros

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:50.399
from what is that's that stuff we put on our bows the purple The Midwives use it

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:55.620
to induce um delivery to induce delivery

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:03.360
yeah it's got some kind of art tell us and uh function beautiful I used to I used

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:10.320
to cut open brains there's nothing more beautiful than the human brain seriously okay let's keep reading I'm

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:17.639

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:09.120
you're the Beauty and the glory of Uranus do you know what happened you know what Kronos did

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:16.500
he castrated uranos he castrated him and what happened when

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:22.400
he casted him blood from his severed penis

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:30.299
splattered on the Earth and when it combined with Earth made the furies

00:19:30.299 --> 00:19:36.360
the true enforcers of DK

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.880
right we as satanists we do not have right

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:49.740
we do not have right we have reason the Taliban the evangelicals

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:55.799
the Orthodox they have right and morality on their side

00:19:55.799 --> 00:20:01.440
we have reason and reason always leads us to Justice

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.900
always leads us to Justice and how do we find her

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:14.760
through the Mysteries it's exactly what you're doing right we're seeing that figure okay let's keep going then

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:20.700
let's keep going and before our root cutter gets uh gets uh out of my control

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:27.179
yes um yeah so he listened to you he you're the heart of Hermes you're the heart of

00:20:27.179 --> 00:20:36.480
Hermes do you know what the heart of Hermes is yeah yeah okay you're the seed of the

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:44.520
primordial gods right you remember that thing about the guarding of the seed The Head and the

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:50.220
heel yeah it's it's the terror root in Latin in Greek

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:56.820
excuse me and it means it means to Be watchful over something

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:03.660
yeah keep that in mind the images right that I'm giving you I'm feeding you the image just so that you can do the magic

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:09.480
um you're the light of Cellini eye of Helios you are the Zeal of Osiris

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:16.500
we're back in a bakic banquet you are the Beauty and the glory of Uranus you

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:22.039
are the soul of Osiris Osiris's diamond

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:29.660
okay you are the soul of Osiris's diamond

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:36.059
um so exalt yourself yeah

00:21:36.059 --> 00:21:42.600
yeah well why are we exalting ourselves we

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.700
Revel in every place why because we are the spirit of Amon

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:53.400
we are the spirit of almond do you know the spirit of Amon

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:59.880
do you know the paraclete yeah it's good stuff it's good stuff don't

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:05.820
get too deep don't pull your head out for a minute think about where you are and everything

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:13.440
yeah as you have exalted Osiris so exalt yourself and Rise just as

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:19.559
Helios Rises each day your size is equal to the Zenith of

00:22:19.559 --> 00:22:25.500
Helios Your Roots come from the depths but your powers are in the heart of

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:30.659
Horus whoops should be Hermes heart of Hermes your

00:22:30.659 --> 00:22:38.220
fibers are the bones of Nevis show us the sacred Bowl will you show us

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:46.500
the sacred Bowl yeah who were we worshiping yeah we as saturnians we as satanists

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:53.640
who are we worshiping and you your flowers

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:59.820
are the Eye of Horus your seed is pan seed

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:05.100
why is he saying these things we're still talking to the plant right

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:10.980
we're still talking to the plant we're capacitating that plant

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:16.260
yeah yeah good

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:23.460
give us the power right he wants it notice further down Aries and Athena right we know what they do we know what

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:31.440
the r i do right we know what Aries really is and why she originally is that

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:38.220
power That We crave to be able to bring DK

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:43.980
are I are you one of the arai are you one of these Furies one of these curses

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:51.780
they often translate that curse um you should you should hope

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:57.299
that you are equal to the queen of Queens yeah I

00:23:57.299 --> 00:24:04.140
start in Ishtar right Str what is that oystress for it's so that

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:12.419
we can enter this oracular state okay let's keep let's keep going I am acquiring you with good fortune and

00:24:12.419 --> 00:24:19.500
good Diamond that's a little bit yeah I actually start after you read enough of this PGM you'll begin to see

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:26.159
the physics he's using the eudaimonic right the you demonic and he's throwing

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:31.440
in just a hint of necromancy with the 2K

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:37.860
right I told you guys if you want to make this work the saturnian magic you

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:45.600
have to resort to randomization right you have to resort to the sortace

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:52.820
and it's a physical um principle of the binary Cosmos that

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:58.080
the bi-dimensional cosmos that we inhabit now thank you MIT for

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:04.140
enlightening us all after saying this he rolls the harvested stock in a pure

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:10.500
linen cloth but into the place of its roots they threw seven seeds of wheat an

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:16.200
equal number of barley oh that's nice you're putting something back he's putting something back instead of just

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:24.120
taking away everything that's a nice gesture he mixes them with honey I don't know why I don't know some botanist I

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:29.340
mean tell us what's going on here after pouring in the ground uh which has done

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:37.760
which is which he has dug up he departs and he is going to be doing something

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:43.140
with this drug

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:48.539
that he is harvested um he's going to be using the very

00:25:48.539 --> 00:25:54.840
powers that we were calling upon right it's an oral incantation

00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:01.320
it's images that as he's digging out the plant with his protective gear on right

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:08.400
because that's all that is that's sodium bicarbonate it's a you know it's a protective gear for a botanist who's

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:15.779
into pharmacology uh wonderful wonderful stuff um and he's burning he's burning incense

00:26:15.779 --> 00:26:23.940
in in the process and he's fumigating he saw it in the beginning um with the pine resin the retina that

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:32.640
that's um he is creating a templum a space

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:39.240
where the power of that God can exist right these are idolaters right they

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:45.299
don't just call them idolaters because they have giant stone temples they do

00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:52.760
have giant stone temples but they call them idolaters because their actions

00:26:52.760 --> 00:27:01.320
are based on the a dolon so when you make an adalon so say you're

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:06.960
in training right and you're supposed to carry out an assassination let's just

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:12.059
start with that an assassination yeah and so what you are doing is you

00:27:12.059 --> 00:27:17.700
have to first bring your Aid along you have to construct your Aid alone

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.760
it's an image and then you take this image

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:29.400
you purify the space around it so that it can be filled

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.760
with the dimones with the powers

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:41.400
and then you take that that thing that you've purified that thing you've imbued you can do this with

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:46.799
people too the thing that you've imbued with the spirit they call those forced

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:54.659
possessions that's a beautiful area of of ancient magic necromancy imagine

00:27:54.659 --> 00:28:01.740
forced possession right it's like VR but active

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:07.500
um it's a it's a real VR um uh control somebody from a distance

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:13.940
like a remote control anyway and they've got death if you're going to enter into one of these

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:19.500
crafts you have to be able to know how to charge those substances

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:25.260
right to charge those instruments those are all instruments from which you are

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:30.840
able to bring that power okay from that Dimension it's

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:36.480
overlapping ours to this one and so you get a lot of

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:42.360
uh explanations ancient explanations of the actual physics behind all of this

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:48.179
binding and how it works and who knows maybe someday people will find some some

00:28:48.179 --> 00:28:54.840
interest in that kind of thing but I think we are just about over

00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:00.120
um I'll just wrap up can you bring up the with with the Bible study can you

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:06.720
and you're saying wait a minute I just thought we were studying by we are we are we're studying the garden and where

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:12.299
you have to start where you have to find there's the tree imbued with the power

00:29:12.299 --> 00:29:18.419
to Open the Eyes right and you have to go to that Guardian who is there that

00:29:18.419 --> 00:29:25.320
one who's tenail the one who is guarding that source and imbuing it with power

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:32.460
giving it the power so that our eyes can be open you have to face Adam

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:39.720
notice the text says you have to face Adam that's where you find Paradise

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:46.380
and um remember that the the Chaldeans

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:53.840
have oracles that thankfully got recorded right oh

00:29:53.840 --> 00:30:01.740
and in those oracles they talk about the physics behind this

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.899
the generation for example of the hecatic sphere that's what we're doing

00:30:06.899 --> 00:30:16.820
right we're using that lightning they call it lightning right in order to create a space where that power can be

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.840
housed and manipulated when we take our adalon we take our Idol that we're going

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.600
to strap around our neck or bury on our bury our neighbors front step to their

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:34.500
domicile um or that we're going to take to a temple and offer and a temple or we're going to wear all the time and freak

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:43.620
people out when we do that we offer to those that a dollar those images we ate the

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:49.260
law and singular it we offer to them the um food

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.080
in clothing and shelter

00:30:54.539 --> 00:31:01.559
and if you are a Christian you do not eat what we have offered

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:10.860
from to hackathy because if you do you might develop that resistance

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:16.919
that Paul has to the snake venom right and if you don't you might have a problem with it

00:31:16.919 --> 00:31:23.460
right two out of three of these you know we end up with troubles when they're infants two out of three babies

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:29.159
at least that's what our death count this is the best stats we can get two out of three babies die that go through

00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:34.620
this process yeah but the one that's generated from it

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:42.120
that's a son of God yeah yes now do you see now some people

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.580
talk to Satan that's the conclusion of our Bible study I want you to know that

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:55.020
what I'm doing is I'm setting your orientation to Adam and so that we can approach the tree of Zoe it belongs to

00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:01.260
Zoe right um it's Zoe's tree the thing you call the tree of life you don't even know

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:08.399
it's Zoe's tree belongs to her yeah

00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:15.720
we have to have a gardener to get us we have to stay real we have to stay with the gardener

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:22.919
right we have to we really want to do this and we really want to talk to Satan if we want to bring those images in

00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:29.760
alignment so that we can see with eyes open if we if we really want to do that we

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:38.220
have to stay rational we have to stay reasoned so um so as not to fall into the grips

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:44.640
of any of any faith or any Dogma remember we as satanists we

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:50.340
don't have we don't have faith we don't have Dogma we have reason

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:55.380
that's what we have as a reason so I'm I'm gonna as we delve deeper into the

00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:01.559
garden and we come across the elwa

00:33:01.559 --> 00:33:08.880
um and we find the tree I can be guiding you in the images that

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:14.279
will allow you to um have opened eyes

00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:21.659
so thank you tonight for the this uh stage one Greek magical papyri lovely

00:33:21.659 --> 00:33:28.200
stuff if you're ever in the if you're ever in the mood for some interesting reading I recommend to everybody to be

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:33.779
reading the Greek magical papyri I know that some of you read Lord Byron

00:33:33.779 --> 00:33:39.480
and I know that others of you are reading other um patriarch I think somebody dug into

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:45.659
some patchmark the secret that I told you to get into so these are all

00:33:45.659 --> 00:33:50.760
um if you'll notice in a kind of an eerie way there seems to be the same

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:58.320
cult that is expressed over time um just to give you a heads up it's a

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:05.220
Renaissance thing I want you somebody in the group to be able to read boccaccio

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:10.378
and I want you to see how he has taken her and he has split her from an

00:34:10.379 --> 00:34:17.760
individual from a vampires from a half fire and a half half Viper half virgin

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:23.398
he has taken her and he has split her into different lives

00:34:23.399 --> 00:34:29.820
so that you can see the eternality of the sotera

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:35.220
yeah you can see her and remember Jesus is a vampire with breasts right we all

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:41.158
we know that by now he's wearing the he's wearing the women's lingerie in the book of the Apocalypse

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:47.878
right and people don't like to look at it right but there it is he's wearing the sexy lingerie and he's got the

00:34:47.879 --> 00:34:55.378
breast and some of the early Christian authors talk about his life-giving milk right that comes from his breasts why

00:34:55.379 --> 00:35:02.040
because sottera the Savior has life-giving milk

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:10.020
yeah um and it says he's got a womb too says he's got a womb yeah why

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:16.079
sometime it's we're gonna we're getting too close to the hermaphrodite to show

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:22.020
you the hermaphrodite right um to to find

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:27.380
her yeah Goddess of War

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:33.060
gorgeous gorgeous the place that we all come is the Grove of Mars right why why

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:40.859
do we all come to the Grove of Mars because that is where we get that

00:35:40.859 --> 00:35:45.480
little bit of lineage of

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:54.240
um that queen of Queens the Palm basilea right um and she is if I recall you that up

00:35:54.240 --> 00:36:01.800
and show you um she is that Venus and you'll be surprised because you're like I didn't know Hera was that yeah yeah guess what

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:08.820
it's Trinity and she is a virgin mother Queen um who is desire everybody's always

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:14.820
shocked they always freshmen in college love to ask this who is the best looking

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:22.380
goddess right who is the best looking goddess and they don't understand they don't

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:30.119
understand that um as in the contest of Paris of which goddess deserves the

00:36:30.119 --> 00:36:37.560
golden apple right as was pointed out with that entire you

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:45.359
know war-starting business um the Apple belongs to the Trinity of

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:51.720
the Virgin the the queen of queens and um desire

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:58.680
yeah it's it's uh gorgeous it's gorgeous and they um they understand it okay I would like

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:05.099
to ask if we have I'm going to look at your comments and maybe um flash a couple of comments up here

00:37:05.099 --> 00:37:10.740
that are directly relevant um so let me just go here

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:18.119
um let's see here what yeah somebody you know the flashlight what about Dante right what

00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:24.359
about Dante doesn't Dante have a civil you okay you who wrote that about Dante

00:37:24.359 --> 00:37:29.820
call up is Ghost find us the Sybil find us the burning purple would you do that

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:35.700
please thank you thank you was that Graham no it's Rat King no it's right

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:41.700
hey there's another one here let's see what we got what do we got here are you telling me the wound in Jesus sign was

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:48.660
his vagina absolutely not he's better than that right no

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:53.880
absolutely not but you know what came out of that woman when they poked him because he was already dead most people

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:59.940
don't realize that they were surprised that he was already dead it takes long to die from crucifixion right right it's

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:05.220
not blood loss you're not dying from blood loss yeah so um you die from

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:10.440
strangulation slow strangulation uh um anyway

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:17.099
um you had to be there right and the guys that were there they poked him they poked him in the side because they

00:38:17.099 --> 00:38:23.520
didn't know why he was dead right they're like dude it's faking it right here Lansing and when they Spilled

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:30.660
Out all that water and that blood did was thirsty drinking lots of water just like just like we know that they do when

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:37.619
they're under the influence of the dip sass yeah in the mystery makes you really thirsty gives you polydipsia

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:42.859
yeah um there's an antidote for it they tried to give Jesus the vinegar on the cross

00:38:42.859 --> 00:38:50.040
right vinegar that word vinegar is their word in the geoponica for the out of the

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:55.560
to the dipsets which would make you be yelling out and thirsting so are there

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:03.540
any drugs that are being used not only are there drugs that are being used in these texts not only did the Romans use

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:10.619
drugs um but your entire history of what you have thought Christianity was

00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:17.280
is because of its drugs you have no idea

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:24.480
you have no idea you have no idea why the pope pardoned Mary Magdalene for using sex drugs for

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:30.540
possessing sex drugs you have no idea right it's a whole world we have it's

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:35.579
not made it through the filter okay let's go to more questions yeah Jesus

00:39:35.579 --> 00:39:41.339
wore women's lingerie can you tell us more yeah go to the Apocalypse

00:39:41.339 --> 00:39:48.420
and watch him you know I had a I had a student this week tell me um

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:55.500
I was working with her in some Greek literature we were doing Plato Symposium

00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:03.060
and we're talking about Eros and who is Eros you know and what that means we're

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:09.900
with the socratics and the flute girls and you know alphabetes was getting kind of out of

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:19.140
hand anyway they got some stuff going on um but uh uh in the in the process

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:26.640
um I asked her to convey to someone the um

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:32.760
the idea that you are worshiping you are worshiping Lucifer you don't realize it

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:38.640
but you are satanic as it stands right now right and how could you possibly say

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:45.119
that if you are an Evangelical you are practicing a satanic or

00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:50.280
saturnian mystery and you said no I'm not no I'm not I'm not doing that right

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:56.099
I'm not doing that well um let me show you how you are the

00:40:56.099 --> 00:41:03.359
saturnian savior is called the morning star or the bringer of dawn

00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:10.020
and that he she wears lingerie

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:18.180
and that he she is your Jesus and um the response we know Jesus is not

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:25.380
yes look at Jesus in The Book of the Apocalypse where he says I jesus am the

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:31.800
Morning Star all dressed up all right he's got the girdle on and

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:37.500
everything yeah it's it's gorgeous um your part if

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:44.460
you are a what is the real wrinkle here is that if you are a an Evangelical if

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:50.579
you are practicing Christian right a follower of the faith you are

00:41:50.579 --> 00:41:55.859
following a saturnian or satanic mystery

00:41:55.859 --> 00:42:02.579
yeah it turns out Q Anon is is turned upon its own head right

00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:07.859
because the baby Essence drinkers are

00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:13.800
the followers of the Christ yeah isn't that weird

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:20.339
yeah it makes you feel kind of disoriented let's see what what other what was the deal with Noah and his wife

00:42:20.339 --> 00:42:26.579
daughter is Noah's Ark related to the Argos yeah um and Jay that's a wonderful

00:42:26.579 --> 00:42:31.980

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:02.700
container um his wife tries to burn it well she

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:08.579
doesn't try to she Burns it three times most people think Arc boat fantastic

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:15.540
we're all set nobody knows that his wife came out and burned it three times

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:24.540
burned it yeah um and that word for Arc can be a box used in a mystery right

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:30.839
yeah he was the man of righteousness and he was that man of righteousness

00:43:30.839 --> 00:43:36.660
because of his initiation he was the one who was preserving

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:44.400
the rights right this is remember this isn't the generation when the sons of God came into the daughters of men and

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.920
they taught them all that drugs and they taught them all the the astrology and

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:55.380
they taught them all the geometry I don't know why it's about to learn geometry there you go

00:43:55.380 --> 00:44:01.380
um uh they taught them the crafts that it was necessary metal working

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:09.240
yeah the metal working and the way to manipulate the fire yeah we need Hephaestus right we need a

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:16.619
Festus that that fire what are you talking about I'm talking about another dimension that you cannot see

00:44:16.619 --> 00:44:22.859
right and that's how you access this saturnian mystery is through seeing you

00:44:22.859 --> 00:44:28.560
have to have your eyes opened I don't want you to come in here and say I've been baptized I didn't know I feel like

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:36.780
a different person no I want you to see in a way that relates a reality to you

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:42.660
that you haven't known when you realize you've suddenly seen and you're awake

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:48.720
you realize your life beforehand was sleep was sleep

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:55.440
yeah so it's time for the sleeper to awaken yeah fantastic right it's

00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:01.440
Resurrection don't you guys won't be Resurrected yeah Who removed the goddess desecrated

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:07.920
the divine feminine and made young boys the heart of the mystery you said it happened before Christians

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:17.099
was it Pythagoras right at the beginning this is a great question uh Lord Snappy yes uh

00:45:17.099 --> 00:45:24.720
um right from the beginning as the right is emerging there there is a movement to make it

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:32.280
into a boys only initiation it's done and there are temples put all over the

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:40.440
Mediterranean under the name of eracles

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:46.319
the glory of Hera okay the Glorious Hera do you see that

00:45:46.319 --> 00:45:54.359
we're back to the original Trinity that's in the mystery right um and Heracles is known in his cult you

00:45:54.359 --> 00:45:59.880
can't uh it's only uh men and boys it's there

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:06.660
and why is it men and boys because it was a woman and a boy

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:15.780
and the only woman that's allowed to come to these cult activities is one that's the medwa the

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:22.800
Medea that's it she can only come in and um why is that why is that because it's

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:31.619
her Dark Harbor right Hera in her orific hymn is the one who in Amy who remains

00:46:31.619 --> 00:46:38.220
within who functions within the Dark Harbor the Dark Harbor that we were talking

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:44.700
about right we're working on this formula and we know that the Galena allows us to

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:50.160
function right the Hilaria allows us Hilaria allows us to function within the

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:56.819
Dark Harbor yeah yeah nice so who took her out

00:46:56.819 --> 00:47:04.220
um if I was to have to to give an academic answer I would

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:06.300
all right I think we're back thank you it for a moment there everything went

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:11.700

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:19.500
about Resurrection we're talking about Resurrection rights and you are entering into that process

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:26.220
of death and resurrection and that is the way that the Cults follow they call

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:33.060

if anybody who spent time with with Lord Byron can any of you tell me after

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:33.780
you're talking with Satan who his mother is who is Satan's mother

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:40.619
right this I mean seriously where is Harvard when you need them would the Harvard people the last video I saw with

00:55:40.619 --> 00:55:47.160
a Harvard person from the religious studies Department doing naughty things to someone the last thing I heard they

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:53.040
didn't know that Satan existed um I want to know who his mother is do

00:55:53.040 --> 00:56:00.480
we have his mother in the text and yes Lord Byron tried to tries to show you right if you have ears to hear

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:07.339
he tries to show you who is that who is she does imrino Venus

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:15.119
yeah okay any other any other um guesses we're going to hold Venus any

00:56:15.119 --> 00:56:17.900
other guesses

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:27.180
yeah oh he told me that he was he told me that what would fertilize okay

00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:32.819
because cathars eat it Lucifer okay so a lot of a lot of answers but nothing from

00:56:32.819 --> 00:56:38.819
the so far nothing is correct I'm never gonna lie to you people right I'm not going to tell you I know

00:56:38.819 --> 00:56:45.359
who the mother of Satan is right we know who she is

00:56:45.359 --> 00:56:52.619
we have texts to back us up so here's my question for you do you really want this do you really deserve

00:56:52.619 --> 00:56:59.280
to know who the mother of of of the Morning Star is do you know who he wants

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:08.099
to bring the dawn bringer yeah yeah I think that's uh I think that's

00:57:08.099 --> 00:57:14.760
I think that's pretty serious so um banjos aside and joking aside and
