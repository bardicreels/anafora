Farmers Harvesters you could say um it it so it's kind of like a scheme right

00:12:53.480 --> 00:13:00.800

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:58.120
Now where's this word coming from where is it coming from the victorians put

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:06.320
right here at coming from Zoe and AO remember that's the name of AA Zoe isn't

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:13.519
that nice guess what guys AA is Greek Eve in the garden of EDM It's All

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:22.120
Greek there's not a wick of Hebrew in it period yeah isn't that interesting a

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:29.480
fantastic it's that Bic shout and those guys knew it eus was writing it down say

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:35.839
this is the way it is that AA is that Mystic shout it's the

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:41.639
name of Eve says eus right fantastic I told you guys that but it took him a

00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:46.680
while to get here he's lazy eus is the laziest for having written as much as he

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.240
did he's one of the laziest people on the planet he steals stuff too what

00:14:52.240 --> 00:15:00.759
credit dudes um go ahead yep um yeah Z so anyway Zoe and

00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:09.600
ago what we have people you can take that what I just wanted to point out is that we have the life that is rising

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:15.680
from a state of death what do you do when you ago someone when Jesus walks up

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:24.519
how does he bring those Dead Boys back to life he awakens them he awakens them

00:15:24.519 --> 00:15:31.680
let's see it you want to see where he's getting with the boys here it is here it is people are you ready so um I'm going

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:39.000
to start just the time I'm just going to translate it quickly because you know I want you to hear the flow of the story

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:47.959
yeah um blow it up for me Chewy are you ready so um Jesus got pissed off and he

00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:55.319
went out with her to the Garden where the memorial

00:15:55.319 --> 00:16:03.959
was and immediately he heard from the from the tomb a great voice and Jesus

00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:12.079
you know coming up he rolled off the Stone from the front of the thing and

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:18.079
went inside and right away there was this little kid there was this little

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:26.079
kid Jesus stretched out his hand and he AO him take it down for a

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:34.759
second Chey he awakened him he brought him from a place

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:42.480
of unconscious reality to a place of conscious reality that is the

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.240
Greek now the only reason I know this is from Greek sources when you expose

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:56.199
yourself over and over and over again to this language um you develop you develop a

00:16:56.199 --> 00:17:02.800
flavor for the vocabulary and it's very easy to see my friends who claim you

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:10.959
shouldn't do that classical philologists get to where they are with sweat and blood you should give credit and you

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:16.959
shouldn't be dressing up like a police officer and pulling people over if

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:24.280
you're not a police officer yes fantastic let's do this then okay keep

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.679
looking I want everybody to focus on the focus on the shenanigans

00:17:29.679 --> 00:17:35.280
um yeah what's going on in line 57 there was this little kid and Jesus stretches

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:41.200
out his hand he raises him from that unconscious State now remember the kid's

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:48.520
unconscious but Jesus is hearing voices from the grave he's hearing voices from

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:55.320
the grave do you know this little kid is not the only one in here did you ever notice that these guys are crowding

00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:02.799
around these tombs getting on those tor Tes with the fumigations getting wild no

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:08.600
no go ahead blow it up J let's keep translating isn't it isn't it lovely so there's this little kid there now watch

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:16.200
this watch this oh God Says with his hand right with his hand that has that

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:22.679
power that's how he raises him that's a magic expression people Jesus is doing

00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:30.840
magic the guy who translated this who found this manuscript said Jesu is a

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:38.000
magician and here he is sorcerer Jesus are you ready and the young boy looked

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.600
up at him and fell in love and he began

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:50.120
to beg him he began to beg Jesus that he might be with

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:58.080
him okay yeah wait is this a text an ancient

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:04.320
text next we're going to categorize it pseudo pseudo something I don't care

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:11.280
it's a text and the vocabulary happens to

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.640
fit um very well very well if this thing

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:24.200
has any doubt or question about it as a classical philologist it is exquisite it

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:30.159
is exquisite yeah yeah oh interesting

00:19:30.159 --> 00:19:35.799
interesting style love it let's go back to it and see that text again I'll keep

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:44.400
translating okay hold on people the kid falls in love with him he says let me be with you right and so um they they left

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.440
they get up and they they left the tomb and they came to the house of this kid

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:57.240
and this is a little bit distressing Yeah P got pluus what is

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:03.400
the because he was rich yeah yeah he was a rich kid okay

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:09.400
whatever um I don't know what's going on but this is a you know party and it's in

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:14.720
a nice place and Jesus is there and what happens and after six

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:21.600
days Jesus gives this kid specific instruction so Jesus is staying on the

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:28.679
compound right with this kid that has been begging him to be with him and what

00:20:28.679 --> 00:20:34.679

nature wait you mean they're marching that 8 foot fallace down my

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:23.279

students carrying a giant phus the impact that this had on the

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:22.720
audience was devastating and the whole place as realistically as we could do um smelled

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:30.960
of an incense that my team wasn't my team team the University's team of prop

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:38.880
designers and set designers what they were able to come up with from a magic formula that I had delivered to them and

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:46.079
the whole place when you walked into the theater and it was sold out every night every

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:51.319

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:46.440
again that you were just flipping on this mental switch you didn't enter into death you

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:53.000
weren't raised revived from a state of death you didn't enter into the

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.680
communion of the cup you are no where near a

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:06.079
mystery you are closer to a philosopher then you are an initiate

00:41:06.079 --> 00:41:14.760
into a mystery and that is the deepest insult I could possibly hurl at

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:20.160
Christianity your mystery is

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:26.839
absent there is more of your Christian mystery in the excitement

00:41:26.839 --> 00:41:33.400
of a priest who is raping a child than in all of your

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:41.640
congregations and all of your crazy preachers and teachers all of them your

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:48.440
mystery is a mystery of the deep things of Satan give me that last one

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:54.560
boom look at this we talked about frogs I wanted to end it with a little bit of

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:59.960
the frogs this is the chorus as

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:07.720
we are going through death back to life this is the

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:16.400
chorus are you ready here we go here we go rise up see that first word

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:24.680
AA rise up rise up the chorus sings to you rise

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:31.359
up he has come

00:42:31.359 --> 00:42:39.640
shaking in his hands that torch that torch that contains the ether

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:44.880
of our souls The Ether of our souls the

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:52.680
flocks do the Greeks have complex words yeah they do do you know what the ether of your soul is no you don't I know you

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:59.119
don't I've been reading this for years and I can barely barely get my mind conceptually around

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:06.920
what that is just you know I I I give myself a little leeway and just say ah well you know that's for smart people

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:13.920
okay when they get into the quantum physics you can't you it's hard to keep up it's hard

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:20.520
to keep up I know there are those of you out out there who this is not hard to keep up with congratulations you're you

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:26.200
know you get an award right smarty pants right okay look at the chorus though

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.680
they say he's come right and then

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:39.440
it come morning star of our

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:44.760
nocturnal initiation Come Morning Star do you know

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:50.559
who the Morning Star is the Morning Star is

00:43:50.559 --> 00:43:58.079
Satan why is Jesus being called called upon as the

00:43:58.079 --> 00:44:05.480
great morning star the great Satan it's because within the

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:11.800
mystery that great Satan is the one who is

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:16.920
christed yeah yeah if you had been there with

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:25.359
Jesus when those delegates you know from the school came

00:44:25.359 --> 00:44:33.520
and they were like hey bro take all this money take your kid go to Egypt get them all set up yeah he comes back he's more

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:41.559
educated than anyone right do you think Judea do you know why Jesus's parents sent him to be

00:44:41.559 --> 00:44:46.800
educated outside of Judea

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:54.640
because Roman wealthy Aristocrats who um somebody wanted to

00:44:54.640 --> 00:45:02.160
punish would get assigned Judea yeah what they called

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:07.680
Palestine yeah it's that bad do you think they

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:14.920
have an educational system there no they don't they don't have a they're just catching up with Greek you notice

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:20.680
there's not really literature until they get the Greek in their

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:26.040
hands yeah yeah that's how it is people I keep trying to explain this to people

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:31.599
I want to say it really quick um because I'm free to say

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:39.040
this not all languages are created equal yeah some

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:46.079
survive and flourish some die some and its a smaller percentage

00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:54.599
reach a level of literary fruition yeah very few reach that point

00:45:54.599 --> 00:46:02.440
most of the languages of Humanity have died because that's what languages do

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:08.359
they die yeah and depending on the time they're

00:46:08.359 --> 00:46:14.240
spoken um you'll see the level of complexity and Technical expertise rise

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:20.440
rise rise rise rise it's why Greek can express integrals and

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:27.160
calculus you mean the Greek language the ancient Greek language

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:33.839
yes yes no insult to the modern Greeks but you know as well as I do that your

00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:42.160
language is a simplification yeah yeah have to has to be brought down

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:47.720
to all of our levels right Ah that's what classical philology is it's trying

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:53.559
to grasp that great wisdom that is

00:46:53.559 --> 00:47:00.720
locked in that powerful Lang language yeah it's gorgeous it's uh nature nature

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:06.040
definitely and the poor Romans like why you Engish not it's

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:12.559
