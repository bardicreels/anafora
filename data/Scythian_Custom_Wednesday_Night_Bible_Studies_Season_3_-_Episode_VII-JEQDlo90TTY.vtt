passages tonight and the first one that we're going to look at is from Hippocrates

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.860
the second is from a guy named Gaius Valerius flaccus which you which you um

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.220
are a little bit familiar with by now because we've used him a couple of times but we want to show everyone we want to

late Bronze Age ripe mystery religion right and we're going

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.480
to step out of that ship we're going to try to see through a couple of these ancient authors we're going to see what

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.060
the um what's actually going on tonight's theme is

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.599
a woman that we have yet to see I've got a little subliminal messaging here

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.700

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.019
like to start they like to start in the Iron Age for some reason they think the city it's just I don't know maybe they

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.120
were deposited here by someone um they're part of these tribes that are

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.340
moving and a mobile populations and they've got branches throughout

I've been working with my students with this text this week my grace students because as it is ionian Greek it is

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.240
ionian Greek and it's good for them to get exposed to something it's not quite attic you know what I mean get some of

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.280
listen to the the attic is okay the ionian

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.500
isn't that nice it's a nice little dialectical difference

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.880
uh they're around Lake miotis which is um the Sea of azov right right excellent

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.600

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:09.840
people were different says Hippocrates or the Hippocratic Corpus whoever it was that wrote this

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.340
right deaf fat on they differed right from the other nations yeah they're called sauromations

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.720
the sauromatai the sauromatai they're

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:29.580

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.620
the ionian to debt on you like that they throw in a little extra a little extra

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:41.280
vowel doesn't get assimilated of that of these people what are the women do he

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:48.479
says the hippods they ride horses and they took celsi toxelsi they shoot

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:57.380
arrows poison arrows okay and they are Contin they throw javelins from horseback

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:04.699
as they're riding wow this some tough people okay and they fight

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:10.740
with these soldiers they fight in Wars

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:18.000
they find in Wars isn't that neat um and then we get the line that throws us

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.520
all the curveball okay don't take your take your medicine right take

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.220
your nausea pills guys right my regulars will know this right take your nausea

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.580
pills

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:40.080
that's how they become parthenic until they become a parthenos well wait

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:47.699
that's the age of able to produce children so but not having had any

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:55.020
children yet that's what a parthenos is right um You can also call her a heifer right

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:02.099
um yeah wow um this is fantastic wait a minute these

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:08.300
girls were in the Cavalry and using toxic bows

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:13.440
using the riding the horses yeah apparently they were so darned good they

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:20.300
could they could kick anybody's butt right even the Romans Mr professional Army right

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.580
even they could you know were no match for these

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:31.560
tribes these horse cultures that are living around the Black Sea some of what

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:37.440
you call the Amazonia right the Amazons

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.860
the Amazons right what do we know the Amazons do we know that they cauterize

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:51.180
one breast why do the girls cauterize one breast Hippocrates says down below he says

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:56.880
their mothers cauterize their breasts right they're right breast why is that

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:03.959
because you know when you're jumping around on a horse at Gallup which is this is what these girls can do you they

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:13.019
can jump around move around the horse as the horse is Galloping and they can sit and shoot you from your

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:18.120
front while they're running at a full speed away from you they can shoot you

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.519
while running away that's fantastic how can you get beyond

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:29.180
that wow that's that's incredible wait a minute what happens when they become

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:34.200
virgins there's right now you see how terrible my students you should see how

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:42.420
terrible is that translation for parthenosis Virgin now when they become of age they'll start having children

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:48.060
right what do they do what do they do they have to kill three

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:53.580
enemy once they get three enemy killed then they can

00:09:53.580 --> 00:10:02.339
take a man it doesn't say they can enter into marriage it says they can take a man they can take someone after they've

00:10:02.339 --> 00:10:07.440
killed three people have to kill three

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.899
um it's a sacrifice right it's part of the sacrifices that must be made you

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:18.540
talk about human sacrifices right sometimes in the performance of the mystery there

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.940
has to be an understanding of the nature of the sacrifice

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:30.560
right and if our if our young women

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.140
who are going to be producing the future generation

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:44.220
if if they are not properly sanctified

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:49.740
right um what are we doing what are we doing what kind of you know

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:57.060
we don't need any of this right all of this is brought to us as we saw last week from like a friend by the bow

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:03.180
by that bow right with its poisons okay I wanted you

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:08.700

cauterizing of the breast and that process of doing it so what an amazing amazing figure just

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.839

what I consider to be a better text um but there's a couple of minor changes but this is a good yeah here's a good

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:58.320
breakdown of you of a short passage that comes to us from guys Valerius flacus

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:07.860
and I want you to remember now he has access to the sibling books okay so he's you could say a the last

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:14.900
pair of eyes that was on our subject right those Mysteries

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:23.220
embodied in that dactylic hexameter yes those Mysteries are buried within

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:28.558
the Prophecies of the sybils yeah you thought it was Latin didn't

that Oracle works and the last eyes to have this

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:55.679
that we have something surviving from or Gaius Valerius flacus who was one of

00:17:55.679 --> 00:18:01.320
the quindec and weary he was one of the 15 people who guarded these books

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:08.820
and one of the 15. now you know some later they disappeared right destroyed

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:14.400

right and that can be include a process these are all words that are used in

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:32.880
conjunction with the making of medicines so it doesn't surprise us that she promised she produces from her sinus

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:38.400
wait what she produces from her sinus yeah

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:46.380

CF Networks CF Ned will see the nervous what is the

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:54.659

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:33.620
is that tension that is stretched when we are going into the orgasmos

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:40.679

from her sinus that flower that flower that is produced by what

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:06.260
it's produced by the stretching penis

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:12.679

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:06.659
because they contain the seeds of Fire seeds fire those of you who bought into

00:29:06.659 --> 00:29:12.840
the Evangelical fairy tale that is the Bible

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:19.380

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:37.020
do that don't you have some people you know these archaeologists wouldn't be having so many questions if we were on

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:43.200
our stuff you know what I mean if we were doing we should be doing but I don't mean classes right because I have

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:49.020
the PHD in classics right and if those of us who have been professors

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.600
right didn't and our professors didn't preserve and guard those tags then we're

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:01.980
not doing our job okay we're not doing our job and you know what's going to happen it's Tartarus baby it's Tartarus

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:45.720
who found this oh it was hackity right she's the one who first made the Harappan or the Fox right the the harpy

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:52.559
she's the worst one to make the harpy yeah she is do you know what a harpy does a Harpy has a scythe and a harpy

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:58.980
cuts off your testicles like that how would you like that do you know what

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:04.980
Hermes says what does Hermes say to the to the idiot Odysseus who's looking

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:11.340
everywhere for drugs everywhere you find him he's he's out hunting for drugs right and he's not looking for drugs and

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:17.640
he's and he stumbles across a woman who is Hermes has to tell he says uh be

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:25.919
careful because she may cut off your manhood yeah he said huh he says yes first she's

00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:31.398
going to drug you and she's gonna use her wand to do it

00:31:32.039 --> 00:31:40.380
now I don't know maybe that appeals to some people but Odysseus he didn't want to go that

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:48.840
route you know he saw what it did to his men he didn't want to go that route yeah so

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:55.799
he made her swear you know I mean he made his swear he's like don't cut off my hoo-hoo and she's like

00:31:55.799 --> 00:32:01.740
well then sleep with me he's like okay but no funny business

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:07.260
right so she comes in prisoner for a while you know eventually let him go

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:12.299
because he cries all the time oh dizzy you thought the Odyssey was

00:32:12.299 --> 00:32:18.539

that you would Devour the riches of the Muse and spit out something like well

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:57.000
Athenian women stayed at home all the time they didn't do anything which first of all is not a scientific statement

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.200
right that's not an academic statement that's just a theory right that you're trying to propagate it has nothing to do

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.539
with the actual history and you know um uh I hope

00:33:09.539 --> 00:33:15.299
and Tartarus that you're able to find some sort of penance

00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:20.940

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:19.080
it's the anti-kythera of pharmacology anywho Medea is using her own body in

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:25.679
case you didn't notice she's using her own body to produce this drug that it

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:31.919
