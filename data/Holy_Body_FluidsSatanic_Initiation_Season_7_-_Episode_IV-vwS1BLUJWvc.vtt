it the only question is is God going to allow our nation to enter a time of

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.879
judgment for our Collective sins which his mercy and Grace have held back for some time or is he going to give us one

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:34.120
more chance to restore the foundations and return to him we will not be able to do it without the Lord's help because

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.519
there's so the flesh is and the mistrust and the the sin and everything is so

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.519

does not really link this to early Christian practices quote I'm not here

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:58.000
trying to protect Christianity from the evidence of psychedelic use said stank

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.240
the director of Harvard center for the study of world religions I expect we

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.720
will find it look how he's it sounds like stank sounds like he's trying to

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:15.159
run for office doesn't he on the one hand I may stand on this side of the fence on the other I'd like to stand

00:19:15.159 --> 00:19:20.559
over here you can't do that in science stank but I don't think we have found it

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:25.760
and I think that's an important distinction to make

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:33.200
stank take that down yeah right okay bring it up again for

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:41.159
stank stank no um bring the sorry bring Greek up jwy for stank one more time

00:19:41.159 --> 00:19:48.039
hey huha stank here it is you don't need to

00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:55.919
speculate anymore you don't need to speculate if you had read the

00:19:55.919 --> 00:20:01.039
text in the original you'd picked it

00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:08.400
up your work stank give us the next

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:15.640
quote Oh I love this let's look now we're we're in the you know the article

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:23.799
we're in the article swimming in it tonight right I thought you said we were going to Jesus don't worry he's coming

00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:30.360
he's coming um there's evidence and there's belief says the author through the article in the end it really comes

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:39.520
down to belief seriously seriously do you not see the

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:46.679
Middle Ages do you not see the stank of the Middle Ages oh my God give me the next

00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:53.240
one give me the next one what else do these Geniuses come up with Christianity has been influenced by every culture is

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:58.640
encountered especially Greek culture and a Greek mystery religions priest said

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:04.919
who thinks that Christianity priest thinks I don't know who this guy priest is but he thinks Christianity existed in

00:21:04.919 --> 00:21:11.279
a vacuum he does he does he says it influenced other cultures Christianity

00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:18.080
didn't influence Jack Christianity came into the world through those

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:24.600
Mysteries and if you don't know those Mysteries St stank and priest you don't

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:31.440
know nothing yeah and you can't make statements like oh this doesn't fit and

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:37.240
that doesn't fit um this cannot be how silly I'm surpris they don't just say

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.360
how silly um and just write it off completely but here we have drugs for

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:49.480
you tonight guys Christianity has been influenced yeah um I think we should have a very expansive conversation yeah

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:55.799
that's going to do a lot unless you learn some Greek that's not going to help you priest um in conversation with

00:21:55.799 --> 00:22:02.600
Christianity about exactly what Brian's bringing up not be afraid of it if psychedelics Were Somehow part of our

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:07.159
history somehow

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:14.760

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:59.760
opes of Apollo right think for a minute Jesus doesn't exist there's no Moses

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:07.640
none of that stuff that was that was given to you in what you call the Old Testament it's long time not being

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:18.960

healing cult yeah yeah Paulo's healing cult this

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:32.360

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:39.159
do you think that's an issue because that was the mystery through which Christianity was

00:30:39.159 --> 00:30:44.200
developing yeah right here it is in the language here's in the language give

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:51.919

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:05.120
here here it is you don't need to speculate anymore right you should have just read the

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:11.480
sources I know you're going to a lot of Banquets you go having a lot of drinking parties whatever you're doing I don't

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:17.440
know but it's sure as hell is not the substance let's go for it I anticipated

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:24.200
you on the whole drug things it was 10 years ago people were saying oh this cannot be right now they're all saying

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:29.440
oh well look now we got to study the decree to which the drugs are used yeah

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.960
Bravo let's just look at what we have with Jesus it gets my goat all of this

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:42.840
stuff it gets my goat look look Ivory Tower look into the cross look at it we

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:49.240
have it there to censor anything that may be that may be

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:56.799
foul we'll cleanse cleanse this place with sulfur did you know Jesus here's a

00:31:56.799 --> 00:32:02.840
new one I'm gonna pop this one on you you guys are so lucky did you

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:10.320
know that Jesus had dope in his

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:19.440
mouth he had dope in his mouth he had he had what that Magus had he had

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:28.240
that capacity to contain in his mouth The Cure right what this this dope is is bad

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:35.279
too this dope is linked to the sulfur and linked to those snakes remember when

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:42.919
he said I'll have you in a place remember when Jesus said I'll have you in a place where you can drink these

00:32:42.919 --> 00:32:49.960
thimon cocktails these things that induce death right the serpents you can

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:55.600
drink those serpents you can lift up those serpents nothing will happen to

00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:02.200
you right nothing will happen to you this is that Jesus right this is that Jesus I know

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:11.080
people don't like this this Jesus that we're looking at because he's a complete Total Drug user when I read that article

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:19.240
and and saw the the very idea that Jesus was using drugs is absolutely is

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:25.200
absolutely the final frontier yeah it is it is let's show him

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:31.720
in All His glory that's why we're going tonight to his spitting that's why we're going to look at spitting Jesus did you

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:37.720
see Jesus spit in that dude did he spit in his

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:47.360

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.398
the all of the accounts of the dangerous poisons that are on the mouth of the

00:34:11.399 --> 00:34:17.960
people right next time you read um um something that you you may learn in

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:24.079
classical myth something called classical myth you're going to read about heracay dogs for example what are

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:29.878
they known for they're all known for that poison spittle right they call it the madness of the

00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:37.040
dog yeah the dog and people say oh God it's rabies right oh God do you realize

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:43.919
what that's what that's attached to that's part of the robelia isn't it oh my God we're getting into the deep

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:51.800
agricultural stuff now this is the real from the ancient world yeah watch that

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:56.960
rust watch that rust so here's what here's what we have bring bring back up

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:03.640
The Source let's go to another one oh look at this yeah oh I want you to start looking I want you to start looking at

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:08.799

boom look at this this is Mark 7:33 yeah so oh God so he took him away

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.800
this is just Jesus and for one of his people that he's going to you know he's

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:36.640
going to open him up he's going to open him up um yeah he's he needs help right

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:41.720
it's medical he's a great physician you bonee head right and what does he do

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:47.000
what does he do here he takes this guy off right from the crowd by

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:54.520
himself right which sounds a tad Shady in the Greek don't

00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:01.680
get me wrong that the d on there at the end it's a little bit of shade of let's

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:11.960
go somewhere yeah yeah let's go somewhere sh come on you and me let's go

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:18.359

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:05.040
minute we know about the cobras right we know about the

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:12.560
spitters yeah yeah um if we spit in people's eyes or into their mouths and

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:17.960
noce is going to clarify this let me be an adult for a minute I was relishing that too

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:25.000
much if if I were to come to your house float through the door

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.040
magically and put my fingers in your

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:37.240
ears and spit into your mouth and then work your tongue that's

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:43.400
what it says yeah I'm not quite sure um but I would

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.839
suspect that there would be something that you just gave me in that

00:39:48.839 --> 00:39:56.520
spit that um is affecting my what does it do for this guy oh God

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:02.480

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:29.560

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:54.400
lunch with the dude that did that or do that whoever it was so okay let's get out of Jesus in the back alley with the

00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:00.160

he healed another blind man by spitting in the clay and rubbing it on the Man's

00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:26.720
eyes he's talking about John but remember we have John translated by somebody who knows the orphic cult right

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:33.920
who knows how the bakets work who knows how the Baptists work so he's really telling you how it is he also spit on

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:40.280
the tongue of a man with a speech impediment right

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:46.040
um and I you know I've never heard actually in all my time I've never heard

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:52.640
a Christian explanation of the the holy

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:58.000
spitball lugie the lugie of the lugie of

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Eternal clumpiness I've never I've never had it

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.079
don't get all excited in Antiquity the doctors um are talking about body fluids

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:15.119
as treatments right you you can treat a child's eye with urine right after that

00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:20.640
child is born if you get a virgin which is a good you know I'm just giving you

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:25.680
what the texts are telling us if you have a virgin and she pees into that you

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:32.359
can walk wash out that child's eyes after he or she is born and you can

00:42:32.359 --> 00:42:38.720
limit the amount of disease that can be passed to that child's eyes we know that

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:43.920
things like chyia right can cause an infant to um

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:52.680
blind to be blinded right and so they knew it as well um these things could be passed in

00:42:52.680 --> 00:43:00.319
the process of birth yeah these diseases could be passed on so that's where we are drug

00:43:00.319 --> 00:43:07.000
wise we're with the we never left the midwives we're always going to be with the midwives because that medicine is

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.520
what produced all of the drugs that Jesus and his gang of hoodlum prostitute

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:18.319
children um are up

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:27.079

how about eyes what about eyes no no you

00:45:29.559 --> 00:45:37.040

that's what's going on that's what's going on so

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:16.800
um we want to find out what's in his mouth that he's spitting that he's using

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:25.400
as a drug he even combines it right with the dirt to turn it into a paste right

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:30.559
which something that you can see the Physicians doing right they're making

00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:36.280
all sorts of applications like this and they're eping them they're it's epith

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:42.520
excuse me they're epith they're putting them on they're applying them that's

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:48.040
Jesus is just being a great physician and he is applying the drugs was Jesus

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:56.880
using drugs yes was did Jesus have drugs in his body yes was the Eucharist drugged

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:04.920
yes bring us up that text show everybody here show them again no the text the text Boom everybody look at that where

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:11.000
there drugs in the Eucharist yes here it is here it is it's

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.040
Vision inducing Vision inducing

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:22.400
Eucharist make an announcement how can we do this do I blow a trumpet or

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:28.760
something here it is people Harvard get off your butts look at

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:34.920
this now if I had been with Brian on

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:41.760
Rogan that's what I would have given him was that evidence right so the article

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:48.040
that we saw in the beginning um is it's really a little bit disingenuous because

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:53.079
those people don't do the sources they don't know right look did you see them

00:47:53.079 --> 00:48:00.240
holding up their hands well if it were the case Cas that that happened then we would change your

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:07.280
opinion right well why don't you get off your backside and take a look take a

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:13.599

that Penelope I like that Penelope the goat don't look there you dirty people

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:33.440
don't do that this is standards here it's educational what I'm doing let me

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:41.960
explain what I'm doing is I'm associating that cross with my inability to show anything of a nature of that

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:50.160
would entail something underneath a goat's tail yeah and go who doesn't love goats man

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:58.160
seriously you can never have enough goats I know one of us has like how many do she have she like 20 20 goats get

with ears to hear hear let's go to the next boom look at this so um yeah so

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:37.520
Jesus knew the jig was up says this I'm translating it right um so that the

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:43.400
scripture could be fulfilled he says I am thirsty we're back on the cross with

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:50.799
him I just wanted to see Jesus yelling out I think I just wanted you to imagine for a minute Jesus yelling out I am in

00:49:50.799 --> 00:49:56.040
the Thirsty zone right he will somebody shut that guy up he keeps keep screaming

00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:02.720
about something to drink it's driving the cops crazy they're dve taking him water bottle after water bottle go no

00:50:43.799 --> 00:50:51.280
happens keep going keep going let's see what happens he takes him aside you know what I mean and he's he does what he

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:57.880
takes him out of there and spits in his eyes put puts his hands in his eyes he

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:03.880
says what do you see now right okay this is that Jesus go to the next one let's

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:10.760

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:35.319
eye test it must be demonstrated therefore that there is a rational power

00:54:35.319 --> 00:54:42.680
in animals I thought that was nice just to put that up there right this is from Antiquity who that I forget who this was

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:47.920
now um I'll think of it in a minute um and in the first place indeed each of

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:54.240
them knows whether it is imbecile or strong in consequence of this it defends

00:54:54.240 --> 00:55:00.200
some parts of it itself but attacks with others thus the panther uses its tooth

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:06.000
the lion its nails and teeth the horse its Hooves the ox is

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:13.240
horns yeah nice the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's Spurs scorpion is Sting but and I love this

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:19.400
part I love this part but the serpents in Egypt use their

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:25.559
spittle for what reason they're called dadis the SP

00:55:25.559 --> 00:55:33.000
ERS okay in this way they blind the eyes of those who approach right your eyes

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.079
are that portal um into your system into your

00:55:38.079 --> 00:55:45.079
physiology right and um if you see the burning purple in somebody's eyes um

00:55:45.079 --> 00:55:52.680
know that it's just you yes it will cause blindness but it is part of the

00:55:52.680 --> 00:56:00.599
process and there are ways of treating people with

00:56:00.599 --> 00:56:07.000
thcs yeah so this is a complex this is a complex world they're balancing out this

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:13.559
potential total death and blindness or blindness with

00:56:13.559 --> 00:56:20.000
um the potentiality that you can ride that

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:26.240
pharmaceutical line you can stay in that as aristos let's look at that Christos

look at the last word here right people I'm going to take you to some medical side and I want you to see the SM and

00:57:41.839 --> 00:57:49.880
the end of it there they're going to be using all he's doing is talking about making an application that is Epi it's

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:56.400
the same thing you are applying for the sake of your um wounds right pushing the

00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:02.079
pushing the thorn they called it um for the sake of those you can put on those a

00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:09.559
plaster that's made out of these but it's using the Smyrna so when you're dosing with the Venoms you need

00:58:09.559 --> 00:58:16.599
something to counterbalance them and that's what they're providing right so make sure you've got

00:58:16.599 --> 00:58:22.079
your Smyrna now what do they give Jesus when he's hanging there on the cross

00:58:22.079 --> 00:58:28.039
they give him smiz wine that's what the text says people right

00:58:28.039 --> 00:58:33.200
they're trying to balance out the effects that the guy was going through

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:38.599
right if you want to die from that thirst go

00:58:38.599 --> 00:58:44.520

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:10.160
them oh God now you understand why he speaks in Parables do you think the

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:17.319
whole time it was so that you would have some magic understanding no it was so you wouldn't understand what he was

01:06:17.319 --> 01:06:24.440
doing right look when you're a l you got to hide the stuff you can't openly find

mouth bit Yeah Jesus Jesus give me it give me it let's not be gratified by

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:49.440
this no gratification go to the next Source

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:56.960
what's our Theon here they're gonna identify it as Brimstone what are you from the Dark Ages Brimstone used to

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:02.480
fumigate and purify oh love it look at the sources on the bottom you see

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:09.039
diores notice that it's perhaps cognate with tho guys in Greek tho you know

01:07:09.039 --> 01:07:15.599
that's the that's the word of sacrifice right and I tell you every time I'm like don't think of sacrifice like you think

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:22.599
think of it as using a substance um I'm turning it into a vapor so that you can

01:07:22.599 --> 01:07:31.240
partake of it you mean that guy standing out there with his Vape pin is closer to ancient religion yeah yeah

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:36.400
sorry right it's the way it is it was all connected they never separated the

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:42.640
nature was a part of it right that's why Paul's going around giving everybody a hard time saying don't call me that

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:47.760
don't tell me that I'm a follower of the Christos right and he's got his flesh

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:55.119
he's that that drug using monkey has his has his thorn in his flesh he's flying

01:07:55.119 --> 01:08:00.839
on the Venoms baby yeah love it it's not just the their combos too by the way you

01:08:00.839 --> 01:08:08.920
can't just get them the way everybody else gets them right oh gotta go through that Oracle love it that's why the pithy

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:14.079
is yelling at Paul let's keep going they don't care the folks at the religious

01:08:14.079 --> 01:08:20.960
Institute um they don't care yeah so this is more of it yeah so that's this

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:26.960
is you see that pay loan is in there he made that what did he do with the payloan that is on line two look at the

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:35.520
first the first word in line three EP he did what he christed my eyes baby

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:41.359
he christed your eyes yeah he christed your eyes notice they're not sitting

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:46.798
there because you who were part I'm talking to the guy at Berkeley I think

01:08:46.799 --> 01:08:53.238
it was stanked Harvard or priest I can't remember which one Harvard I think it was har who's the guy at Berkeley I

01:08:53.239 --> 01:08:59.440
don't know it doesn't matter Dr dud little thanks chewy

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:05.758
um um what what you've got here people when you use the term Christ you think

01:09:05.759 --> 01:09:11.159
in the Bible institutes in the Bible colleges you thank in the Bible

01:09:11.159 --> 01:09:16.758
departments um that this is like a special term that was used um came out

01:09:16.759 --> 01:09:21.838
of Jesus's mouth and then everybody was like huh yeah right we'll adopt that

01:09:21.839 --> 01:09:27.520
term no no Christianity comes

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:36.640
through the helenistic world it doesn't exist in a vacuum it is

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:42.440
there because of the Greek culture it's there

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:50.400
because of the Greek religion and they're using a term that the doctors are also using right it's

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:57.199
the technical application I told you guys that every everybody says ha Messiah and it has nothing to do with

01:09:57.199 --> 01:10:04.960
that it is the application of a drug Jesus is the

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:10.239
Christos he's the one who has the

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:17.679
christing that's why we want him to spit in our mouths and our eyes I want him to spit wherever he wants right if I'm

01:10:17.679 --> 01:10:22.719
going to be a good Christian if this guy who promised us tonight you saw it I

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:29.440
think it was priest who said it one of these guys said it's okay one of these guys said hey if it's that way and

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:35.480
ultimately we're going to find it it stank from Harvard if it's that way and ultimately we're gonna have to embrace

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:44.360
it guess what stank you're gonna have to embrace it a lot deeper inside of you than you thought

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:52.640
yeah you're gonna have to it um yeah yeah he's gonna spit because that

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:59.560
Exchange of the drug is absolutely Paramount to the practice you know it is

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:08.800
what is the mystery you don't get a mystery without complex combos of drugs produced by

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:15.280
people right who can do the christing yeah remember media she's the

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:22.159
first recorded incident that I found the first recorded incident um that of

01:11:22.159 --> 01:11:28.400
christing yeah so this is a Bronze Age development right maybe she created it

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:37.520
herself I would tend to think because they explain the fumigations is her specific creation and producing that

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:44.600
bakic enoic state um you would think logically that because she's the one

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:51.880
who's using those drugs that the christing has to come through those specific drugs so

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:58.320
probably more likely than not she's the source right she's the one who develops

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:07.520
that treatment it wasn't always around it didn't hang from the trees right it's evolution of biology right so

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:12.800
um yeah there we are there we are this is what I wanted to bring you

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:19.040
tonight I wanted to bring you a little bit of the present and I wanted to pull in so that we can see the future and the

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.280
past I wanted to kind of sit and dwell in that present bubble I want to um

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:30.600
people say don't do that because it dates you but in the iota we have to set

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:36.840
that center point I want to bring in the Theon I want to bring in the sulfur to

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:43.560
purge this place again right which Jesus had in his

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:50.639
mouth yeah guy was extreme bro and I want to bring back the sulfur Purge

01:12:50.639 --> 01:12:56.800
watch this let's do it one more time this is our present bubble Focus From The Throne hit it

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:02.719
chewy the only question is is God going to allow our nation to enter a time of

01:13:02.719 --> 01:13:09.000
judgment for our Collective sins which his mercy and Grace have held back for some time or is he going to give us one

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.239
more chance to restore the foundations and return to him we will not be able to do it without the Lord's help because

01:13:15.239 --> 01:13:20.679
there's so the flesh is and the mistrust and the the sin and everything is so

01:13:20.679 --> 01:13:27.000
great here that we this is going to have to bring people to their knes and I look I I believe God is about to do something

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:33.360
