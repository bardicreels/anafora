welcome back to ladybabylon we have a great great appearance tonight from

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.120
somebody who's going to help us Bridge the East and the West

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.640
so that we can see the big picture of the Bronze Age right

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.100
um and we are going to talk about um the reason that we've come lady

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.820
Babylon

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:18.960
[Music] thank you

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960
foreign

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.540
Maiden chamber in which was the son of Earth in which the girl nursed yourself

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.460
begotten offspring with her manly breast lift up your acts that played the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:53.240
Midwife to save the people of your Athena with your delivering Hatchet

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.780
we've come tonight to a place that we're going to look at something that was

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.840
proposed to MacMillan press as the follow-up

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.040
what I did was we all know about the ionian and the attic and the coin a and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.560
the Dork we know about these different dialects of Greek but I found that

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.080
orphic Greek in the existence of the thing called orphic Greek I want to show

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.640
you tonight a translation of chapter 17 of John's

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.520
apocalypse using the orphic Vox

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.599
so this is the language applied to the

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:53.640
chapter to give you a seat in the place of those with ears

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.519
to hear I want to read you this little introduction that I wrote for uh uh this

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.239
book cracking the first code in the early 19th century

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.060
Otto Kern an exceptionally nerdy German scholar of classical Greek discovered a

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.159
hidden language buried in the writings of ancient cultists

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:24.379
he called this language the Vox orfica an arrogantly erudite Latin phrase

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:31.200
meaning The orphic Voice because it was originally created by the

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.980
cult followers of the famous thracian poet Orpheus

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:48.299
the voice is older than democracy itself it predates Jesus and his Apostles by

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.379
almost a millennium and it possesses its own uniquely

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:02.280
compelling linguistic structure within its complex web of intentional

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.560
concealment The Voice communicates a clandestine

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.040
system of rituals and compound drug recipes that form the

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.799
foundation of the world's very first mystery cult

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.259
the voice was the linguistic scaffolding upon which the Apostle John knowingly

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:33.419
constructed his apocalypse I'm going to read you

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:40.860
the orphic Vox over revelation 17.

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:49.979
we can look if we have any time we can look at the Greek at the end but I want to give you now the seat so now now what

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.320
we've done is it's very simple we've just taken the terms that are used by

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.380
the orphic Vox and we're translating them for you and anything

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.919
that has an association with that word bringing it out it's true translation so

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.500
that you can hear what the actual text is saying

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.720
um yeah we yeah we are breaking those

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.780
seals which the trojiscoi are little pills

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.900
suppositories the seals that you put rectally you

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.500
apply rectally so that you may enter the wilderness

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.660
okay all right are you with me okay so uh yeah here we go here's the

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.960
translation yes warning to the reader I'm sorry I

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.919
did I had to officially do that um here we go

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.840
one of the seven trans-dimensional Messengers spoke to me

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.240
one of the seven Guardians who possesses the seven alchemical distillation

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.620
devices pay attention I will show you the condemnation of the

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.639
great [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who manipulates the powers of the dimensional waves with whom the

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.759
terrestrial rulers have had intercourse

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:34.500
these Earth rulers inebriated by consuming her own sexual fluids have

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:41.639
filled the terrestrial Dimension with her demonic inspiration

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:50.039
with that the messenger transported Me by means of possession to the place of

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:58.500
vision where I comprehended a woman under the influence of a Scarlet

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:06.479
colored potion which provided her with future sources

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:12.060
of blasphemy the potion was compounded of seven

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:20.400
Venoms and ten Botanicals by means of her burning purple this

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:28.560
Scarlet potion enabled her to carry the purity of the stream of the muses

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:36.000
the precious voices of the oracular priestesses and the jewels of their

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.500
pronouncements by means of her oracular voice she dispensed to the terrestrial

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.039
World in her fluids from her vagina

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:57.240
this prostitute commanded the accursed powers fated to overthrow God

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:04.940
she stored the power in the form of a highly visible magic name

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:15.240
mystery she was the Persian Queen

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:23.360
great leader of the Magi mother of sexual communion possessor of abominable

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:30.500
god-killing power that resides in earthborn elements

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:37.020
she was made invulnerable by the famous

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:46.020
drugs called the blood of the Holy and the blood of the one who screams

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:52.140
Jesus I was struck I was awestruck by this

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:57.779
great woman when the messenger the one of seven said why are you so

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:04.620
impressed with the woman in the vision I will expose her mystery acts and the

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:11.240
Scarlet potion that gives her power I will expose the potion with its seven

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:18.120
Venoms and it's ten Botanical ingredients he went on the potion you

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:24.240
see which was once made by her is now no longer made

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:30.720
but will return in the future when it is brought again into existence out of the

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.820
emptiness of her body it will destroy

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:43.519
God the demons who exercise power in the Earthly realm

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:51.420
will be Thunderstruck when the potion and its use return to

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:57.120
this realm these are the powers not found in the

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:04.920
Book of Life the magic book of Eve whereby Eve's drug recipes were first

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:11.459
established Sophia

00:10:11.459 --> 00:10:20.100
Ewa herself will teach the wise the seven serpent Venoms were discovered

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:26.279
on seven mountains where lady mystery once practiced

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:34.680
the powers behind them are of seven types five of them have disappeared one

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:41.640
remains and one will be found in the future when this one is discovered the

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:47.600
potion itself will temporarily return

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:54.959
and the potion which once existed and is no longer present this very potion is

00:10:54.959 --> 00:11:02.399
the eighth communion and is the product of the seven Venoms and will bring

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:09.540
destruction of God the ten Botanical ingredients you see

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:17.399
are ten powers not yet manifested but they will combine under the essence of

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:24.839
the seven in one hour when combined in the potion

00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:32.040
combined together the Botanicals and the Venoms have one goal one Effect one

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:39.300
power these ingredients will act as antidotes to the RAM and the ram will

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:46.260
Master them because they will make him the master inebriant and the leading

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:53.820
power of powers and these ingredients are carefully chosen

00:11:53.820 --> 00:12:01.680
yeah and the One messenger of seven said to me the pharmaceutical ways that you'll

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:07.760
come that uh the pharmaceutical waves that you see commanded by the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.779
these have been preserved by various ethnicities

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:18.120
sex Nations and languages and the ten

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.459
sources you see along with the potion these

00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:30.660
induce the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to produce an orgiastic right and make her to become inspired

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:37.560
they will consume her body and make her burn with fire

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:45.060
for the goddess constructs the POI Potions by putting into their essential

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:51.899
nature the ability to accomplish a single purpose from a plurality of

00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:58.200
ingredients she gives the potion the ability to

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:07.860
bring her own song to completion and the woman whom you see she is a great City

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:16.380
the home of the Magi and she gives power to the potion by mixing the powers of

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:21.500
the Earth so

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:28.620
yeah so if you apply the orphic terminology

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:35.040
straight over to the translation that's what you get and

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.860
um the pharmaceutical depths of this are

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:47.100
uh you can't you you can't understate them so I I just want you to realize

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:55.320
that this image of the individual who is the one who Bears the cup

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:02.820
the one who brings the cup in analog right for doing this on a logia

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:08.339
um the one that brings the cup is the source of that communion

00:14:08.339 --> 00:14:14.160
right and this is you say what communion is this what

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.320
um where does this come from I just wanted to read you it's it's the

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.480
communion of the virgin um yeah really it's all this form is a

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.240
communion of the Virgin yeah um with her virgin milk

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:37.139
she let streams of statutes gush into the baby's lips and drops into the

00:14:37.139 --> 00:14:43.980
girl's mouth the sweet produce of the attic be that

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:52.500
um we're talking about the Virgin herself the source of that milk that nourishing

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:59.300
milk we're talking about Estrella

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:05.519
astraia with the Sigma Tau row or Str root

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:10.680
right she is the sister

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:18.000
of the dawnbringer she is the sister of the dawnbringer

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.980
okay so again remember the images we're working with the images so and in this old what's called an old

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:33.060
generation of deity within this old generation of deity

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:42.360
um we have laid out for us the plan of how to perform the mystery how to

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:48.959
bring it back so to bring us to the place where we enter death and then are

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:57.199
resurrected from it the whole object if of these Mysteries is that interaction

00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:02.339
with the other dimension that is around

00:16:02.339 --> 00:16:09.180
you we um we have a goal we get together with the Athenians right and um they're

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:17.120
celebrating the Mysteries our the goal of the myth the Ellis Indian Mysteries is to raise the Korah

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:26.639
it's to visualize the Korah to be able to interact on the level of

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:33.300
the Korah it's a coming together mystery operation is a coming together of those

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:39.540
two Dimensions yeah um and that's why fanes the visible is the god of the

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:46.980
process yeah all from the Throne of Satan is where we is where we get this right um

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:52.079
so I'm reading to you just a couple of little varieties little Snippets I want

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:59.160
to take you quickly then to the Greek text I want to show you a couple of things with Greek here

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:04.980
um Seventeen one let's go 17 1. yeah

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:11.280
um is that do we have 17. yeah there we go um this is just the Nestle Allen text

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.980
for those of you who are interested Nestle Allen text um I'm just gonna read through and I'm

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:22.260
gonna give you a flavor for some of the terminology some of the images that are

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:28.980
being thrown around so we've landed squarely tonight at the feet of Lady Babylon

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:34.500
um and who she is we're discovering who she is we're looking from the Throne of

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:41.400
Satan right from that necromantic source that necromantic origin

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:46.740
um so let's just look quick at a little bit of the a little bit of the Greek

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:52.440
um yeah so you're one of these guys one of these

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:59.220
Messengers comes forth right and these Messengers are a very distinct entity in

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:07.440
this realm of the vision of which you are attempting to induce in the death and

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:14.640
Resurrection rise the death and Resurrection brought back right this is this is good you know

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:20.640
does anybody smell Bacchus right yeah we have to have a sacrifice right up front

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:27.780
good take him out dress up pintheist take him out and um watch him pull his head off why

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:33.179
purgation purgation remember this is the environment we're working in

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:41.340
we're working in okay I just want to say a couple of things here what does this Angel have he has to feel us and some

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:46.620
people um you know they'll they'll just try to describe this you know some kind of

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:52.260
offering dish right um and it's it's a kind of a saucer

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:57.720
um but the ones that I've seen they describe being of iron

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:04.559
yes they describe being of iron isn't that interesting that gives us a little place on the

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:13.140
radar there to you know land our ship um but we see these in mystical riots

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:18.360
um the the women in the audience might understand

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:25.620
this better or have a better because it's a theme it's a thing for people with breasts but um they're used as

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.660
coverings um by bakans

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.760
so mean ads put these things on their chests

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.100
um in war situations right because they're very combative they're very

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:48.059
um they don't let you get away with anything yeah and if they catch you they'll Chomp your head off right and

00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:55.020
get a group of these ecstatic ecstatic did you notice that lady Babylon right

00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:01.620
away enters this is about entering the Ecstasy right yeah so you were smelling we're

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:09.000
smelling uh we're smelling that old orphic religion right from which the

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.220
orphic Vox comes so the orphic Vox it's just the images

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:20.580
the orific voice is just the images that are coming through the right

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:26.580
through the right um one beautiful thing is that name at the

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:34.100
end of the episodes that we have that we Flash in front of you there um people people watch Game of Thrones

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:41.340
and Lord of the Rings and things like that um there is something way cooler right

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:47.160
than that they have their languages that they build in these shows and it's great you know it's fantastic it's like

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:54.900
working backwards with the Linguistics right gorgeous Applause for the creativity right but we

00:20:54.900 --> 00:21:02.700
have a language that is real and that exists and its name is Dragon tongue

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:09.539
it's supposed to be a language of a higher being

00:21:09.539 --> 00:21:15.000
yeah a higher being some of these they call them sons of God

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.880
and these guys knew drugs they knew drugs they've walked around teaching people drugs

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:29.640
yeah anyway um sons of God right um so yeah yeah uh uh yeah yeah

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.640
so the Beast everybody talks about the Beast so when we take the seal the

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:42.900
trojis when we stick it in our backside and we're entering that stage of vision

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:50.220
and we meet The Messengers right the seven you know this is what

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:56.159
you'll do the PGM has directions just like this for entering the Visionary

00:21:56.159 --> 00:22:03.179
state where one can interact then with the beings that are around you

00:22:03.179 --> 00:22:12.659
and you'll be surprised you'll be surprised how much of um the New Testament particularly makes

00:22:12.659 --> 00:22:17.820
such good sense with this background it's fantastic the the magic you know

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:24.120
there's a reason they're running around talking about The Throne of Satan and and a reason they're running around

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:30.900
saying that Lucifer or Satan is the king of this

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:39.840
um sits on the throne here this is his world you know what I mean he runs things right so yeah my kingdom is not

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:45.480
of this earth right it's not the Earthly Kingdom that he's talking about people don't understand

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:53.039
that because they don't look back they look through the fairy tale it's presented to you by pastors and by

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:59.100
priests yeah when I thought it Seminary I know what I'm talking about

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:05.100
it's not the fairy tale world that you think so this Beast

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:13.020
therion is a poisonous Beast right the strike of this thing

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:19.559
um somebody mentioned scythians before we go on somebody mentioned scythians and uh

00:23:19.559 --> 00:23:24.840
um the train is chasing me tonight um somebody mentioned City and I just

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:30.059
wanted to pull up um a definition here for you

00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:37.860
um one of the short the very short one for one of the first ones go ahead let's see put that after oh no that's not no

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:45.679
go down to that one you know that one fantastic yeah right right right right

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:53.340
so you know um people really don't know the derivation of this Greek word right

00:23:53.340 --> 00:24:00.799
and they'll argue they'll argue the etymology makes it from somewhere else to suit whatever

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:05.820
Indo-European scheme that they're linguistically trying to build right

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:13.080
without knowing and people say the citians um just popped into existence in the

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:19.320
early Iron Age and we have nothing about them from being around well don't worry

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:27.480
they didn't just pop into being through a black hole there were migrations and they were involved up with the Aryans

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:35.159
yeah and the khmerians who most people don't study anymore but this is good

00:24:35.159 --> 00:24:41.280
um these guys were from Ukraine this is beautiful I mean beautiful the the

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:47.100
peoples are gorgeous but remember Bronze Age we're in that we're in that Bronze

really great really happy to be a part of this community and it's it's been really inspiring for me

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:16.980
um I'm coming at this from as Simone was saying an Eastern perspective I have a degree in religious

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:25.260
studies from Carleton University with a specialization on uh tantric shaivism in

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:30.720
India and what I wanted to do for us tonight is in what I did for Amman

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:38.340
earlier today was I gave gave a brief presentation um examining three different myths that

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:44.940
kind of show how um shivite tantrica is related directly

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:50.820
related to the orphic Mysteries and that they are dealing with the same mystery

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:56.760
there's the same uh processes and ideas that are going on so the first myth that we're going to

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:02.580
examine that I want us to go over is the myth of prajapati so uh oh also just

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:09.060
before I go any deeper if anyone wants any sources or anything from me they can just message me on Discord as was said

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:16.260
I'm Lord Snappy I'm not going to assign anything here but yeah so we're going to go directly to the rig Veda to the myth

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:24.138
of prajapati and prajapati within the rig Veda he is the um

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:30.780
primordial sort of male figure and this is sort of a creation cosmogony that's

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:37.080
very similar to the orphic cosmogony in the beginning in the rig Veda they

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:45.419
describe the cosmic Waters okay as a sort of Eternal plane of chaos okay and

00:34:45.419 --> 00:34:51.060
at the same time the only other thing that is present is tapas Tapas is

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:56.700
austerity or sort of um violence an attack upon the self it's

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:01.920
also in the later tradition specifically within Tantra it's described as desire

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:09.300
or Shakti okay so Shakti comes upon the waters okay and it commits an act of

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:14.520
violence it commits Tapas and through this toughest upon the Water there is a

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:20.160
heating that occurs and that produces the cosmic egg I'm just gonna quote the

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:27.900
rig Veda now that egg the one a rose through the power of heat desire Came

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:33.359
Upon that one in the beginning that was the first seed of mind

00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:42.300
and I don't think I'm making a big stretch seeing how this is related to the orphic cosmogony when next occurs is

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:48.900
that the egg is existing in sort of this perfect state of Eternal Bliss but Tapas

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:54.240
is still there okay this drive to self

00:35:54.240 --> 00:36:00.780
um austerity to self-attack and this desire starts to influence and heat up

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:08.099
the egg the egg then cracks and from the egg we are given Lord prajapati Lord's

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:14.460
prajapati the Lord of All Creatures this is a bigendered god this is a

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:21.119
multi-faced multi-armed multifaceted God the representation of the entirety of

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:26.940
all creation the primordial one this is fondness that we see in the orphic

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:33.599
tradition I don't think this is a stretch okay and then what ends up happening with fondness is again we have

00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:39.839
this Force this Tapas which in my conception I equate with the ion this is

00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:46.020
our Saturn right this toughest force is interacting with projecty and it causes

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:52.560
him to commit austerity okay so he starts to attack himself and from the

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:58.380
shedding on this from this self-sacrifice we get the arising of the

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:04.079
Gods we get the unfolding of creation and this brings us to our second myth

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:11.040
within the rig Vedas we also have the same being seen as the purusha the

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:18.359
cosmic man okay and we know that these beings were equated because the epithetes are almost the exact same and

00:37:18.359 --> 00:37:25.980
the language is similar so while a lot of Scholars like to separate purusha and prajapati in my conception they are one

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:31.200
and the same they are both interrelated they're just two separate

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:39.780
um understandings of the same being that come to us in the rig Veda so again within the rig Veda we have this purusia

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:47.040
this purusha is suffering Tapas he is doing Tapas to himself he sacrifices

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:52.920
himself and through that sacrifice the universe is created we are given all of

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:58.320
the Gods we are given the entirety of all of the planets of all of creation it

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:04.380
comes out of this personal sacrifice so most people when they're familiar

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:10.440
with um what we call like the early sort of Hindu tradition the central focus is

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.960
this idea of the sacrifice and this purusha myth is at the heart of this the

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:21.480
mystery of The Vedic religion is all about recreating this primordial

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:26.820
sacrifice is that of the cosmic person okay dividing them and separating them

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:33.900
into us so the right takes on two forms by engaging in this sacrificial right we

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:39.780
are in one hand participating in the Act of Creation we are perpetuating creation

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:45.720
forward by sacrificing our horses by emblazing them in the fire and by

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:52.079
sending them up into godhead we are pushing creation ever forward we are

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:57.720
making the sun rise okay that is part of it but there's also the secondary part

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:04.320
the Soma the secret mystery okay what is the function of this second sacrifice of

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:09.900
this Soma when we ingest this Soma and we go back to this part we are still

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:15.420
reliving the sacrifice but this is a sacrifice of return this is about going

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:22.020
back to the original prajapati returning to the cosmic egg returning to the Huron

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:28.619
Garba the golden embryo back to our primordial States and when we go there

00:39:28.619 --> 00:39:35.820
we get to exist in the one this is that eternal return this gives us the

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:41.520
overcoming this is our savior aspect of it this is what connects us again to the

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:48.240
orphic mystery now I just want to take a step further into history and now we're going to go

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:53.760
deep into the Tantra and we're going to examine the tantric understanding of a

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:59.640
very common myth the myth of the samudra mantam the samudra montham occurs in the

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:05.460
Mahabharata and this literally means the churning of the ocean of its milk okay

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:12.780
this is a myth it's all about describing How the Gods gain their immortality how

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:18.660
they're able to create the Amrita the Amrit which gives them or the Ambrosia

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:24.300
as we see in the orphic myths that gives them their immortality and what happens

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:31.640
is basically there's this Sage who is shamed by the god injured by accident

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:38.339
and the sage in his anger curses the gods and revokes their power from the

00:40:38.339 --> 00:40:43.460
Davis and the Davis are unable to defend themselves and they start to lose

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:51.660
continuously in Wars to the assurance and the assurers they're sort of our Titans the leader of the assures is

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:58.140
Shiva this is our Dionysus figure okay this is our reborn God okay

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:04.260
so the issuers are in control of the world the Devas do not like this they

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:10.079
decide to approach the neutral party the one who's in between the preserver they

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:16.200
go to Vishnu and they ask Vishnu what do we do we've lost their power the the

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:21.300
entire order has been upset we're no longer in control the assures are how do

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:27.180
we restore this and Vishnu says you're thinking about this wrong you need to work with them

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:32.400
you need to come together to do something greater and he tells them of

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:39.660
the Amrit and he says if you work together you can gain immortality and you can produce the milk from the ocean

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:45.839
okay now what we have just understood earlier in

00:41:45.839 --> 00:41:50.940
the rig Vedic hymns and in the rigmatic myths is that the original figure is

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:57.420
this projapity this purusha this Cosmic person who is sacrificed and becomes the

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:02.640
literal embodiment of the physical Universe he is the earth and the oceans

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:09.960
what are we churning we are churning the purusha okay what do the gods and the

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:16.260
well sorry what did the Davis and the asuras do they band together and they take the tallest mountain they take

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:23.280
Mount meru then Vishnu transforms himself into kumara the primordial

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:30.060
turtle and they stick these together and they create our lingam our Unity of the

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:36.720
phallus and the vagina the linga and the Yoni all right and they use this to

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:44.339
churn the ocean for its milk okay they take the snake the Cosmic World snake

00:42:44.339 --> 00:42:50.160
the Suki and they use him as a rope and through rubbing in friction with the

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:56.220
mount meru they cause this friction to churn and produce the amrites but while

00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:04.099
they're doing this physical task of churning of affilating okay

00:43:04.099 --> 00:43:09.900
vasuki spews poison and this poison is going to destroy both the Davis and the

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:16.380
asuras but Shiva Rises to the occasion and he decides to sacrifice himself he

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:21.660
drinks up all of the Suki's poison he consumes it all and it is about to kill

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:28.140
him but just before it kills him the goddess appears this poverty his Divine

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:34.319
lover and she stops the poison in his neck and in the tantric tradition they

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:40.740
interpret this sexually okay what is going on here is a sexual process of

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:47.460
transmutation the poison goes throughout shiva's body and it permanently turns

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:55.680
him blue and then what is described is that poverty and Shiva produce the Soma they

00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:02.400
draw down the moon and they add that to the churning of the oceans to help

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:10.740
create the Amrit and at this the gods are also throwing in countless herbs and

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:17.040
spices and other psychoactive elements as they are churning this milk and they

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:24.720
are creating the samarites right yeah let me let me say let me just step in first of all uh that's gorgeous that's

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:32.160
absolutely gorgeous and I want you to know that as I'm sitting there listening to your description nice use of text as

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.859
well fantastic as I'm sitting there listening to your description my mind is

00:44:37.859 --> 00:44:45.359
in Cyprus with the cult of Aphrodite celebrating the death and resurrection

00:44:45.359 --> 00:44:54.000
of Adonis yeah and exactly the descript even down to the very concept of what

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:02.280
waters are and how the life comes from them it's just it boggles my mind that

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:10.440
the Bronze Age that the Bronze Age was able to produce such Brilliance such uh

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:17.720
such incredible sophisticated religion medicine

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:24.060
culture yeah yeah okay is there anything else you wanted to say yeah I just

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:31.560
wanted to end this with my own little personal thing is that when I was I got to travel to India with my professor and

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:38.819
my professor was an expert as I said on uh tantrica and he was working specifically with the agoris and the

00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:45.180
igories are uh or a certain sect and one of the ways in which they do this

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:50.339
thing they have this symbol here is the lingam in the Yoni United this is a

00:45:50.339 --> 00:45:56.099
lingam and this is representative of the churning of the ocean of the milk this

00:45:56.099 --> 00:46:03.020
um what then they do in this particular cult is they have the guru called the

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:11.160
nagasadhu who ingests the poison of the Viper and then he offers his

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:17.460
um seminal fluids to his followers as a ritual offering you know so they are

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:23.579
tripping on his fluids and this is happening to this day in one sect of uh

00:46:23.579 --> 00:46:30.680
of Indian shaitism but yeah that's all I wanted that what do you do what do you do with that

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:39.060
Contraption British bring a thing back up to the camera real close and show me how you use it okay so this I use this

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:44.880
this is a central focus of the um this is representative of Shiva and Shakti

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:50.700
United together in one to produce the amrits and uh this is used as the idle

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:55.980
Focus um you're supposed to offer milk to this you douse this in milk

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:01.680
um this here this part here is the uh rudraksha that is uh literally the eye

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.720
of Shiva or the uh rude Rock should bead which you meditate upon it's the seed of

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:13.020
life this is again very saturnian she was seen as um using us as seeds to

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:20.280
produce trees and and doing that to us and so yeah this is an idle Focus that's supposed to be representative of that

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:26.520
myth the samudra mantum and uh when we we focus on this we remember this and

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:33.000
we're supposed to um use this to do this alchemical process in ourselves so the tantricas

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.700
also see this as a process that's occurring within yourself the spine is

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:44.819
vasuki the snake that's unfolding um you are have when you have an orgasm

00:47:44.819 --> 00:47:50.520
you are shooting this energy up through your body that's expounding out through

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:55.680
your third eye and this is your Enlightenment experience this is it's

00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:02.160
about it's it's this image is showing you and telling you the myths in symbolic form and you're supposed to

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:09.060
worship and engage with it so that you subconsciously and physically recreate

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:14.880
the mystery and you do this as a discipline daily so you can bring that milk with that

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:20.640
device let me just just throw in for us on your back wall there

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:27.780
um just tell us in a couple of sentences who is that okay so on the back wall That's Kali so

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:34.500
Kali she is the Shakti she is the Divine energy she is the fire she is the one

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:41.520
she is Shiva in it's active um Force so in my conception this is

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:50.220
Lady Babylon right this is that force of destruction of the of fire so she in

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:55.560
that particular painting there is in an action of destroying the universe and

00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:01.680
sheba throws himself at her feet to beg her to stop and they're paused like this

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:08.579
and she's actually crying out in shame because she's like I'm just about to kill my husband because I can't calm the

00:49:08.579 --> 00:49:15.540
F down but yeah she's a powerful powerful figure that is the goddess that's the

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:23.640
you know beautiful I wanted I wanted you to bring that up because I wanted to bring it back to Australia right and I

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:29.940
wanted us to see that generation of Dawn and what they were doing was the mystery

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:36.180
um Darren and I had a nice discussion today which came which came first who was contributing what and they'll they

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:43.140
can shoot those arrows as much as they want and try to figure it out right and who knows maybe maybe they will

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:51.180
um we talked about the founder too I want to find out who it was who perfected it and was able to use their

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:58.920
own body um and of course everybody in my in my audience knows that um that I

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:04.020
think that the drugs if you trace the drugs back you go right back to caucus

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:11.640
with Medea and she's the one initiating this burning right and um but um East

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:16.859

00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:29.280
you go over to the Saxons and pull up pull up one of their you know images uh

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:35.579
one of their one of their linguistic images of the Great Str Queen yeah

00:51:35.579 --> 00:51:42.119
something like that but Rob your Rob is working on that I've got remember we're detectives here and we're just tracking

00:51:42.119 --> 00:51:49.260
down where this thing is coming from at the Garden of Gethsemane and I wanted everybody to know that you um I'm having

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:54.859
people on the show right I say show on satanic initiation it's not a show

00:51:54.859 --> 00:52:01.200
satanic initiation and I've got people coming on but the rule is you have to to

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:07.020
maintain the Integrity of the process um I'm using the same ancient practice

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:13.140
right the scythians did this it's why you can you can say to scythian

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:18.180
something is to shave your head right a guy's doing the scythian thing he's he's

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:23.880
got himself shaved um we'll have Chris Bennett in the future come and talk to us about those

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:30.540
scythians and what they're up to and uh with their asterian but in order to come

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:36.420
on you have to in order to be interviewed within this space you have to shave your head

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:41.460
just like they did in Antiquity you have to shave your head right and if you if

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:48.780
you don't see the purpose yet if you don't see the death and rebirth process

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:56.579
um call up appuless book 11 and watch how he prepares for the initiations

00:52:56.579 --> 00:53:03.300
watch and you'll you'll pick up on key terms and you're you're having ears to hear now so you'll pick those up and see

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:09.300
how he's using the magic if you don't want to shave your head I'm I'm uh

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:14.960
talking with Dr riglioso about coming on and talking to us about Virgin birth

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:20.339
because we need to address the Virgin birth right it's part of the whole part

00:53:20.339 --> 00:53:28.260
of the the whole mystery so um uh she can uh uh there's an option as

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:34.859
there is for in the worship of Aphrodite and she'll understand this if you don't want to shave your head you must present

00:53:34.859 --> 00:53:40.160
yourself publicly for the rights of Aphrodite

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:46.760
there are two peoples right there's those who mourn and shave their heads

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:51.780
and there are those who don't mourn

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:56.880
and keep their hair and the only time that we keep our hair

00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:02.819
is when Adonis has been resurrected and then it's you're well within your you're

00:54:02.819 --> 00:54:09.180
well within your rights so if you honor aphrodite um great but otherwise shave your head

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:14.940
and mourn mourn the death of the god that ice right for ears for those of you

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:21.119
