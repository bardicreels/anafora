00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.020
one's a left-handed and one's right-handed yeah so um that's nice we

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.140
have a privilege tonight that way we're going to jump in I'm going to take you guys to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.480
a place where people in antiquity

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.640
got high on the burning purple and I'm

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.040
going to show you what they saw that's what's tonight on lady babylon's

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.939
Bible study

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:28.468
[Music]

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.320
the first thing that I want to do is take you just hop right we're gonna hop

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.579
right in the ship and we're gonna go we're gonna just take off tonight because I want to show you look we've been talking a lot about drugs in the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.259
ancient world we've been talking a lot about sources that talk about the drugs and we've been talking about it in cult

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:56.579
context we've looked at some parts of a formula for one of the Galena one of the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.240
famous antidotes to counteract the communion

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.760
so we've looked at all of those things now let's look at some people actually using them and I want you to recognize

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.879
while we're doing this that we are communicating on two different

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.160
levels so the idea is that look I mean this is

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.819
the this is the world we're in um happens to be two Dimensions right overlapping each other and you can talk

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.340
back and forth you can interact right um and if you know the right things that

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.480
you can move the mountains right this is pure mystery pure mystery this the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.400
Christians cannot deny this right it's pure mystery so um what I what I'd like to do is to

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.700
teach you if I had a group of people's very secretive group of people and we were working on some big private

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.800
projects I would have them Reach Out reach out to this frequency

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.860
um to tap in to be sitting on that Throne what Throne is that's the throne they call it the Throne of the devil

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:19.260
right um I would be sitting in that position in order to hear the left-handed track

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.440
that's being played right two tracks fantastic okay so tonight what I want to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.200
do is I want to start with Orpheus we have to bring up Orpheus and

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.860
um we're gonna have a nice little video too beautifully done by the way thank you to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.440
Chewie for everything um for piloting this ship uh thank you

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.400
Chewie you've been a great um I wouldn't be able to do it without you so we're a fine team

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.860
um let's go to the text I want to bring Orpheus back and in order to get Orpheus back we're going to have to go here to a

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.739
root cutter right this is where we're going to get this information we're going to get this information from a

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.739
root cutter who is the root cutter the root cutter is that professional who knows the

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.840
plants and who knows the drugs who knows how to acquire them how to process them

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.880
what time of day it needs to be done specific times of the year different weather conditions she knows what to do

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.759
with the drugs she knows how to prepare them to combine them this is somebody who's got a lot of knowledge and this

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.860
knowledge is passed down it's generational knowledge right and some of

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.320
it gets ended up it ends up getting up getting written excuse me

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.520
um written and recorded for us and we have these gems of these sources the one I want to take you tonight is written by

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.940
the son of one of these famous root cutters and um by the way Sophocles

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.880
wrote a play called root Cutters right so um it's a big deal in Antiquity uh so

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.979
here we go she is passing the knowledge that we are getting tonight

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:12.540
um the scene the ability to see this scene of these drug users actively performing the mystery the power of that

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.060
tonight comes from Orpheus Right comes from that root Cutters tradition we have

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.198
to summon them this is our first text right this is our first text

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:32.060
or Patel log on python

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.199
Martin who's

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.860
ebullah man yes these are the lines of the great

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.380
virgin these are the lines of the great Crimean virgin

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.660
Crimean virgin who is she she is the one who was sacrificed

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.960
for the welfare of her people and when I say virgin I don't mean

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.780
sexual virgin um I mean an age group virgins in

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:17.360
Antiquity or an age group the nymphs are the ones who are ready for marriage

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:24.840
ready for marriage so we're talking about an age of life here if a Janaya is the

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:32.340
the great if he won ASA this is old old Mycenaean cult

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.100
okay so we're setting the stage here right which is just land our ship we're getting out where are we what what

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.580
century is it right what age is it where are we we're in the late Bronze Age

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:50.759
and we are worshiping a virgin yes we're worshiping a virgin and that

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:57.060
virgin was a sacrifice but when that sacrifice was meant to

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:03.979
take place Diana provided

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:10.380
a substitute and took the sacrifice

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:17.220
yeah and she installed that sacrifice in

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.380
crime what we call today the Crimea but

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:28.139
in Antiquity they called it the land of the towerians

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:34.680
yeah sometimes we say at the very you know it we talk about the uke sign

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.199
the ice in us they call it originally the sea the Black Sea and there is the

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:48.300
Crimea and there it's from there that are virgin and all of her worship comes from She's

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.699
installed there and what is her job her job

00:07:53.699 --> 00:08:01.319
is to take captured Greeks and execute them

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:06.419
very specifically and why would she do that because she's

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:14.180
the Virgin she is the dewanasa all right she is the Diana

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:20.400
who was sacrificed and for that reason because of what Grace did to its own

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.099
daughter they all die doesn't matter doesn't matter they all die they're all

00:08:26.099 --> 00:08:31.979
sacrificed she's the one that does it she's the Virgin who does that sacrifice

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:38.580
so she says in this text if I possessed

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:43.640
the logos of Orpheus

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:52.760
foreign to persuade with song

00:08:52.920 --> 00:09:00.899
so that even the rocks would work in unison

00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:08.100
with me whole mountain is a great great verb it means to it means to for two

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:15.720
separate entities to work to be bound in a relationship to where they're coming together is the

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.540
production of the work yeah

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.880
yeah so that I could

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.519
enter into it sympathy with the very elements

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:37.740
Kaling Kaelyn what does Kalyn I mean show us

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:42.779
here if I could charm now again this is

00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:48.920
thanks to the victorians shout out to England and the uh yeah and the scholars

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.540
150 years ago yeah sorry I don't know what that says about modern scholarship

00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:01.620
but the good stuff comes out of the 1850s in England and um that's where

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:09.959
we're getting this charm thing this charm thing it's a call by an

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:16.380
incantation it's a call if I possess the logos of Orpheus

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:23.700
I can do this to whomever I want

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:30.720
yeah if I had it I would use it she says if I had it I would use it I want you to

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:38.120
remember one thing it's talking about the power of Orpheus and this is part of the the

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.920
background of the cult and all of this you think this is or

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:50.579
people talk about Orpheus Orpheus Orpheus right how important orifice is is Christianity the product of orphism

00:10:50.579 --> 00:10:56.040
of course right of course it is right this mystery that we're talking about it

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:02.880
is the original mystery it's the oldest that we have for

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:10.500
creating that oracular response whether it's the Jews who are doing it from a box in a tent full of smoke or whether

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.600
it's the Greeks who are doing it over a tripod

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:22.019
it's the original mystery and what's funny is we always attribute we always talk about Orpheus

00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:27.360
Orpheus Orpheus Orpheus was the student of Medea

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:35.220
yeah as usual I'm sorry but as usual there is a brilliant woman

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.380
behind the origin that nobody discusses

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:47.100
yeah it's a shame it's a shame I'm gonna take you to the place where the purple is and where they're using it and we

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.920
have a text that'll talk about that so um when you are

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.459
talking to Satan when you were talking to Satan

00:11:58.459 --> 00:12:05.220
when you're using that saturnian Oracle you've entered that initiation and

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:11.100
you're then operating actively you can function within Both Worlds at

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:17.700
once so that the rocks must obey

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:24.839
yeah gorgeousness we've got a little video I want you to see this video um this is in the other world where the

00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:30.779
north is the South and the south is the North full of subliminal messages for you so

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:36.899
eat this one up tonight everybody in the world knows that men

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:42.140
don't think very much of women who are easy women who are easy

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:49.740
having a virtuous wife is being like a rich man with big sack of rubies your

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:56.760
husband is blessed God is favoring him by providing a wife providing you for

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:02.339
this man easy easy is the ruler of this world these titles

00:13:02.339 --> 00:13:09.240
and many more signify Satan's capabilities we must remember that God has given him domain over unbelievers

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:16.200
only Believers are no longer under the rule of Satan unbelievers on the other hand are caught in the snare of the

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.779
devil lie in the power of the evil one and are in bondage to Satan Satan is the

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:28.019
God of this world it's not saying that he has ultimate Authority it is conveying the idea that Satan rules over

00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:35.779
the unbelieving world in a specific way these bad guys at Corinth are Satan

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.339
self-righteous respectability that is the that's the Beating Heart of Satanism

00:13:41.339 --> 00:13:47.279
abortion God has forgiven it porn sites God has forgiven it and we think oh you're starting to introduce moral chaos

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:53.940
no forgiveness of sin is not moral chaos but I believe that God has built men to

00:13:53.940 --> 00:14:01.380
engage with the world and God has built women to be domestic between Presbyterians and twerking drag

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:08.100
queens is not to display an adverb of neutrality this only happens when the state has decided to decide with the

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:15.120
kinky tribe Plus [Applause] had everybody in the world knows that

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.519
men don't think very much of women who are easy

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:28.560
so this is not a fairy tale that we can live in right

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:35.459
um we're going tonight to see the queen we're going to see uh somebody who is

00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:42.079
not a bag of rubies are you a bag of rubies

00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:48.360
I know I could be a bag of something a bag of rubies I don't know

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:56.699
um that's the fact that you put up with that is just to me is absolutely phenomenal it shows your patience wow

00:14:56.699 --> 00:15:03.360
um I want to bring up another passage in Greek here and I just stuck out one line out on the side there it's just for you

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:10.079
to just for you to get comfortable with um because it's an important line but in

00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:18.720
the first four lines of this little speech that we have here this is again from the son of the root cutter and he's

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:27.720
talking about the great virgin that is worshiped by the towerians in what we call Crimea

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:35.639
yeah fantastic and on the fourth line he says hey um there were some guys that were washed

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:42.660
up you know on the shore and they were down in the crack of the of the side of

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:48.240
the wall the cliff where the ocean where the sea hits up against it right by the

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:55.880
way they called the they called the Black Sea an ocean right the khmerians live

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:01.680
beyond the ocean in the Greek mind and that ocean was the Black Sea and those

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:07.740
chamarians come from the Crimea earliest people from Crimea fantastic that fourth

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:14.660
line says they ended up in this little cave little Crag where the

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:20.880
dealers in uh the purple

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:28.380
where they do their thing where they deal in purple did you know there's two Greek verbs

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:35.040
yeah this is weird this is weird but Greek has several ways of saying to do

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:40.320
the purple yeah to do the purple so here they are

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.779

and pull that one up yeah here's the word just for the

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.100
Skeptics in the group right the poor fiery remember is the purple

00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:03.060
you know that's the modest you know it's probably a place where they fish this thing out of the waters and

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:08.400
prepared it and then apparently administered it

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.160
the guys that came up and saw them the locals that walked up and hear these two

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:21.000
guys messing around right where the purple is those those guys said

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.459
um it was God right it was a couple of gods that washed up you have to be

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:32.040
careful another guy said no no it's not it's just some humans just some Greeks

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.500
he said washed up from the shore right washed up there they are let's go get

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:43.320
them and kill them right take them to the sacrifice and the great version because this is at the bottom of the top

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:49.500
of this place on the top of this place is a hill and the name for that Hill is the name

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:56.039
for doing purple it's got a temple on the top of a temple

00:17:56.039 --> 00:18:02.940
to the virgin okay so let's watch what happens when these guys use this drug this is this is

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:08.700

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:09.120
whose wife is a sack of rubies that's so demeaning I don't know how you

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.460
people put up with it I really don't know I don't get it whatever it's your choice

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:20.460
okay what does he say what does this one guy say he's stumbling around and he's like Pilates his friend's name is pile

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:26.520
of this right a couple of Greeks yeah right pilot is he says dead orcas did

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:33.679
you see that thing and he says tended I do that kind of

00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:40.919
it's a look there she is do you see her it's the dragon of Hades

00:19:40.919 --> 00:19:47.160
it's the dragon of Hades now that may not make sense to some of you but for

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:53.160
some of you take the right path you'll know that the Crimea

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:59.520
has a dragon and a gateway to Hades

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.860
to Hades we have a dragon we have a gateway to Hades

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.960
um this thing is so old that Homer even writes about it and it's speculated that

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:17.179
Homer got it stole it from the epics about Medea

00:20:17.179 --> 00:20:22.620
which makes would make sense right because before

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:28.620
Odysseus is running around in this skirt Medea is

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:34.039
ruling the world yeah yeah

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:40.679
fantastic this is gorgeous I tell you this stuff so what's this guy doing he's running around he's like ah there's the

00:20:40.679 --> 00:20:48.000
drakaina of Hades right he's like do you see her do you see her he says um

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.880

she comes like she's coming like she wants to kill me and what has she got she's got danais to hit nice for those

00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:06.720
of you who follow the Echidna or the ahidna you know the in the dips ass the

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.820
poison right you know that this is her the Viper here she is she's coming at

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:20.460
him with these terrible terrible Viperine darts right oh God this is gorgeous

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:25.620
yeah and um now this next line it's a little

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:31.500
odd and not translated very well so you guys are sitting tonight on the you're

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:39.059
looking down into the canyon right on the top you're looking down because this is not done this text is not done right

00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:44.940
the translations are right but that's it's obvious that something is messed up right from our

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:52.140
understanding the very next line foreign

00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:00.059
yeah she breathes fire

00:22:00.059 --> 00:22:06.600
from her chitin yeah she breathes fire from her

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:13.559
undergarment yeah she breathes fire from

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:19.500
her clothing yeah yeah

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:25.740
wow and what else phone on death

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:32.220
she breathes fire and death from her covering

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:38.940
yeah the Great dragon of Crimea

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:45.179
that's gorgeous I love it and how does she do it with the feathered

00:22:45.179 --> 00:22:51.600
wings with the feathered powers yeah that's feathered Powers it's the

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:58.880
arrow poison right if you don't recognize that orestes is in a state of

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:05.000
oysteromania right now from that arrow poison

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:12.179
yeah then you're you know you're missing the boat or something uh he's seeing her

00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:19.580
though he's seeing her though and uh he says oh my goodness she's gonna kill me here she comes

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:31.080
yeah and then he makes what they call airiness

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:36.900
he he makes a vocalization which they associate with Airness

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:42.960
aaronis is Fury when you're transformed into the theory you know it right you

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.120
know it and how do you know it hang on under this Drug's influence

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:54.120
you bark like a dog and play like a sheep

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.340
yeah like a sheep so which is not I've seen

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:05.640
this description elsewhere um nikander talks about it right so the prophets of the great mother

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:11.880
would come in with the purple on right eyes you know they've been taking this

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:18.980
drug in their eyes right and they come out in the streets and they start screaming at people

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:27.419
furiously about their desecration of the great mother

00:24:27.419 --> 00:24:32.820
is your city wounds daughters and their mothers

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:37.860
you're going to get the prophets of the great mother yeah you're going to get the prophets of

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:42.799
the great mother that show up right

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:50.640
yeah okay so um throw up Herodotus just for the

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.740
naysayers let's just let people see that we're not joking here about what's going

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.900
on right among these the Towery have the following Customs all Shipwrecked men

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:07.740
and any Greeks whom they capture in their sea raids they sacrifice to the Virgin goddess it tells you as I will

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:13.559
describe after the first rise of sacrifice they strike the victim on the head with a club

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:20.820
this is like one of those clubs that they brought to apprehend Jesus with right right this is not a don't be

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:27.840
thinking Hammer right this is uh this is an Implement I mean you know anyway they knock you on the

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.179
head first I don't know is that nice um yeah and uh according to the source

00:25:33.179 --> 00:25:39.539
they they then place the Hat on a pole and throw the body off the cliff on which their Temple stands isn't that

00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:45.779
nice others agree as to the head so they get bonked but say the body is buried

00:25:45.779 --> 00:25:51.360
not thrown off okay well that's a tiny detail the tower themselves say that the

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:56.460
deity to him they sacrifice is agamemnon's daughter iffegina look at

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:01.799
that so the Greeks aren't just running around claiming that's that's the Greek

00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:07.740
daughter of the king right no it's actually her right the Italians fully admit that

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.960
right good as for enemies whom they defeat each cuts his enemy's head off

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:19.500
and carries it away to his house where he places it on a tall pull stands it high above the dwelling above the smoke

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:25.320
yeah good good these heads they say are set up to guard the whole house yeah if

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:30.419
your house were had heads on Pikes around it you

00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:36.960
probably wouldn't have to even have a guard dog they have a lot of guard dogs in Antiquity but um you probably

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:43.260
wouldn't even need a guard dog for that right who's going to go into a house where there's a head on the outside so

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:50.279
okay look I know it's shocking you're in a different part of the world you're in a different part of time you're in a

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:57.179
different place but this is how world is functioning we're in the late Bronze Age can you smell the late Bronze

00:26:57.179 --> 00:27:02.940
Age right be feeling the the lack of civil Authority but the presence of

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:10.200
armies that are led by by leaders or coalitions of very powerful uh wealthy

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:15.480
people building big cities and of big Stones this is you know this is the way

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:20.760
to go this is the way to go yeah blood Bronze Age

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:27.179
okay fantastic and who do we come up on next late bronzes we're we're getting

00:27:27.179 --> 00:27:32.640
behind let's go to um the last text that we've got there

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:40.140
for you to see I want you to meet up face to face face to face

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:46.799
with our oops let me get up in the way here with our a little bit of Latin from

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:54.360
uh Valerius flacus right who who has access himself to The Sibling oracles

00:27:54.360 --> 00:28:00.960
all right he's got access to the book so he knows right if anybody knows the history of

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:06.059
the purple and the visions that are produced by it

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:11.460
yes the saturnian writes if anybody knows it it's this guy

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:17.640
and um he's writing about the rising the uprising here literally the text it's

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:23.580
the coming up from underneath from underneath right Hera

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:29.039
is the reason we're all here the queen of Queens right Hera

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:36.840
right and Hera needs

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:43.500
right let those with ears to hear hear Hera needs

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:51.419
the world to conform to her

00:28:51.419 --> 00:29:00.480
and so she calls upon the power of Aphrodite

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.580
to use the Medea

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:14.100
the medwa or the Medusa she calls upon her a human

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:21.419
a human right which I'm at two different dimensions now together functioning together

00:29:21.419 --> 00:29:28.860
hang with me and what's funny is the the one element that

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:34.620
is this reflection right the all the guys at MIT are saying hey this is your reflection of the reality through the

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:40.260
Event Horizon right everything that is in this reality that is reflecting from

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:46.380
that other side um that is powering

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:53.039
this individual who is who is

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:58.559
every mind every mind

00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:04.620
imagine that every mind in one virgin

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:11.940
so there's a civil war going on there are scythians involved

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:19.440
um you know the chamarians the chamarians in Crimea they were the ones who who really made a place for this

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:25.440
Oracle in the first place right so all of the sibling power that comes from the

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:31.860
Crimea that were you know kind of stuns us as modern uh uh Scholars of Greek

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:37.220
history and of Greek languages um this kind of

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:43.200
Eastern influenced what the Greeks would call barbaric

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:49.380
area is the cradle for the very mystery

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:54.659
that ends up being Judaism and Christianity

00:30:54.659 --> 00:31:00.960
yeah and it does so through a virgin yeah so you can see why she'd need to be

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:08.000
controlled right you'd you can see why she's a bag of rubies

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:15.000
comes down to that I'm sorry I hope that pains every every female ear

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.360
out there tonight I hope that hurts stings you I hope you get that

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:29.880
boisterous and I and I hope you feel that because I don't know how how else to prod right I

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:35.700
lost the prods by the way people there's a group of people who are talking about hey I want to join I want to do it and

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:41.640
I'm a woman that's fantastic fantastic we'll talk

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:46.679
about um you know yeah what's stopping you right

00:31:46.679 --> 00:31:51.840
um let's look at these verses to finish off here um this is from uh Valerius flaccus

00:31:51.840 --> 00:32:00.960
right and he says right she comes into the mind she comes

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:07.020
into the mind of the goddess comes into the mind what is she men's

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:12.299
omnis the all mind

00:32:12.299 --> 00:32:19.860
yeah in one virgin Santa wait a minute you mean all of the

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:25.679
stuff with the Civil War and the gods and the powers of the magicians that are

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:34.020
around all this stuff all this killing can be solved by one virgin yeah yeah

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:43.559
um and remember she's 12. she's 12. the text says she's not ready yet

00:32:43.559 --> 00:32:49.860
um to Wed right that's 13 14. right 13 14 15.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:56.520
somewhere in that range she's not ready to Wed yet she's not a full nymph so

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:02.159
she's 12 or 13 years old I was shocked when I found out Juliet was you know a

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:07.500
teenager right or is she like 15. right I was surprised

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:15.059
14. fantastic thanks Julie um but what you have to realize is that

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:23.220
if you're an Athenian you worship virgins you guys no problem with that right there is something there

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:30.419
that must be honored and it's only the atheists that don't honor the Virgin you'll notice when it where the Virgin

00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:37.320
is kicked around it is she is kicked around by atheists and now you understand why the earliest Christians

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.419
were called atheists

00:33:42.539 --> 00:33:47.760
they didn't honor the virgin yeah they did not have the virgin

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:53.120
you're right what is special about Medea

00:33:53.120 --> 00:34:01.679
nobody else the text says nobody else has more powerness Aris in the nocturnal

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:08.580
in the nocturnal altars okay you're way out of your league

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:14.099
right you realize that you step out of the time machine you're looking at this cult and you're like oh wait a minute

00:34:14.099 --> 00:34:21.240
what does that mean the nocturnal altars remember we're at the opening of the underworld right

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:28.320
we're with the guys in the purple all right we are seeing and interacting

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:35.158
with the Great Dragon the Sybil of Crimea right the chamarian civil

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:40.260
my goodness this is good stuff this is a this is a

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:47.460
Bronze Age beauty is what this is this is gorgeous I love it yeah and what what is she what is

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:53.580
everybody so worked up about this virgin she right because you haven't heard what

00:34:53.580 --> 00:35:03.240
the version does until now some of you say oh I'm Catholic we do Mary right yeah yeah you do just keep keep

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:11.599
thanking that right what does this virgin do what does this virgin do this virgin's

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:17.940
premiatus the pounding vibrating of the chest

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:27.599
of this virgin causes things to happen you know it causes the Stars to be fixed

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:35.160
in place and to quiver pollen they quiver

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:41.040
causes the Sun to be stupefied

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:48.680
in its track fantastic

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.960
and how does she do it she does it with her sucrose

00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:02.820
she does it with her juices her death and life-bringing juices

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:11.400
that's what the text says it uses the Latin word for juice and it's like from plants right talk

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:18.000
about the medical guys talk about what kind of juices of what plants do what right now that's usually translated

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.480
drugs it's usually translated drugs um especially because Medea's reputation

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:32.460
that we have Texas they as a matter of fact this one does in just a few lines that Cersei who's known everywhere in

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:37.859
that little triangle between Libya and Sicily where she's predominant where

00:36:37.859 --> 00:36:45.960
she's powerful and you can feel her influence there she's known to be nobody knows

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:54.359
more about drugs than she does and she fears the understanding that Medea has

00:36:54.359 --> 00:37:02.220
of these juices she fears it so the most fearful woman

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:11.480
the most powerful woman is afraid of the power of this virgin

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:18.300
so what are they doing in Antiquity the text goes on to talk

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:28.020
about what she can do she is the master of Orpheus she is the

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:34.440
one who founded the right it's her right she is the cup

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:40.680
she's the one whose body became the processing device for the communion

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:46.740
blood all right the essence call it the Hyma

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:55.079
right that juice which is the essence right she is the drakaina

00:37:55.079 --> 00:38:01.980
who is coming after the initiate the one who is entering

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:08.300
into death yeah for Great Stuff great stuff um we can talk about

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:14.280
oracular prophecy coming through that great Hera

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:20.640
through the Trinity of the Hera Aphrodite and the Virgin those are the

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:27.240
three that Focus their their oracular power on this process of

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:33.720
bringing this voice some Stu some people have been asking about that right and

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:39.599
about interacting with that voice imagine a world where there were other

00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:45.800
entities around you forces that controlled what was going on

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:51.540
interacted with and controlled right imagine if you could interact with

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:57.780
those well you can your eyes can be opened

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:04.099
and you can be as gods you can

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:12.660
there is a very powerful initiation

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:19.560
that is preserved by Lord Byron

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:26.099
by Lord Byron you should be able to use

00:39:26.099 --> 00:39:36.859
that initiation to gain the power of the logos

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:42.540
yeah for those with ears to hear fantastic and for those of you who are

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:48.680
coming for the evangelicals coming that I always say the same thing to remember

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:56.280
Jesus Christ was arrested in a public park at 4am with a naked boy

00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:04.140
remember that tonight we have uh we're going to um move to a couple of guests we've we

cathonius we have cathonius and tonight go ahead

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:48.480
I said thank you tonight I wanted to start with you though this I wanted to ask you

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:53.520
um we've been we have a lot of people who've come out of cults right and

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:59.579
they've they've gotten to that point that they've seen some whatever whatever element of

00:40:59.579 --> 00:41:05.099
reality it was that woke them up right and they said this is not right what's

00:41:05.099 --> 00:41:12.780
going on right and they stepped out of these cults I think we have a particularly sensitive

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:19.140
topic with you and that is you seem to have come out of

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:26.280
a cult that has political um uh power to it right a political cult

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:33.540
we'll just say the I'll let you define it but can you just tell us a little bit of where you've been and how you got

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:38.760
here you know all the way from there how do you got to this place of of thinking

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:44.160
differently and they used to support Donald Trump I used to believe in his make America

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:50.280
greater again agenda but what I didn't see is what he was really doing with

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:56.640
Christian nationalism I didn't see that what he was promoting was through mainly through Christianity and anybody that

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:03.359
seen his like Macho chauvinistic egotistical ways I didn't I I didn't see

00:42:03.359 --> 00:42:10.020
that when he was controlling the Christians that he was arming hate groups like The Proud boys and and how

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:15.240
he would I knew that he was on Epstein's Island and I denied it because I believed in what he was doing I thought

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:20.460
he was really going to make America greater but all he was doing was fulfilling an agenda that I don't know

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:27.119
and if he would have kept going if he would have got office again or if he gets office again I feel like

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:33.960
Trump would be doing the same thing that Putin would be with trying to go after a group and he he did not like pagans he

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:40.140
didn't like he didn't like the lgbtq community he seemed like he was really racist towards Mexicans and blacks he

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:45.720
was he was sexist and he was an egotistic opportunist and how I got there is learning about

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:52.140
Christian nationalism I never really heard that word until I heard the group talk about it and now I see Putin doing

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:57.720
it as well with with the ukrainians the Putin uses the church to his advantage

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:03.359
and that's what he's he's arming his citizens with that he's feeding him them that and that's exactly what Trump was

00:43:03.359 --> 00:43:09.180
doing to the Americans what do you think what do you think though is my question number two and

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:16.020
then I want to follow up with Snappy and Rob my question number two is the first flag that entered

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:22.020
the capital um the first flag was the was not the

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:27.240
Confederate flag I was expecting as soon as I saw it I saw I watched it live like

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:33.119
most people as soon as I saw it I was like oh they're gonna have Confederate flags there right which they did and

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:40.280
they've got Trump's face but the first flag that went in there wasn't an American flag it was a Christian flag

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:46.740
and I thought my question for you clonius is why do you think these people

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:52.079
who went into our capital why do you think they

00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:57.319
carried the Christian flag in right after they defecated in it

00:43:57.319 --> 00:44:04.500
that was because they was using it to their advantage that was their whole thing that he was God's chosen appointee

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:10.319
it seemed like that's what he was trying to he's trying to kind of in a way deify himself as like a king of America like

00:44:10.319 --> 00:44:16.800
like a dictator in a way that he truly won that election when he didn't and he there was using Christianity to arm

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:23.579
themselves to make them to brainwash them to think it was okay that's that's what I think truly

00:44:23.579 --> 00:44:29.579
yeah yeah snappy snappy the same people that

00:44:29.579 --> 00:44:36.780
stormed into there the same people are the ones who would take somebody

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:42.420
um who would put on a feminine kit and might take them out and and do something

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:47.819
to them they might you know they might put laws they might make laws their laws

00:44:47.819 --> 00:44:55.339
being made around the world against LGBT uh communities what uh

00:44:55.339 --> 00:45:00.960
uh is that what we get with a theocracy because what phonies is describing is a

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:06.660
Theocratic an attempt to think of a Theocratic takeover of the U.S we all

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:12.980
live through it we all watched it and we're all shocked like uh what do we do now right

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:18.440
Snappy what what what's the future for all of this

00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:29.760
oh you're uh muted sorry we really have to uh stand up and uh

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:35.280
help the people who are being scapegoated in this time and recognize it for what it is like this is an

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:43.740
opportunity to divide the country right and they're using a marginalized group of people to to be to vilify them and to

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:49.020
get all of your hate wound up you know they play on people's insecurities they

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:54.300
play on people's fragility you know they first they abuse you and they make you a

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:59.880
man or a woman and they tell you you can only be that and they force you into this dichotomy and they force you to be

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:05.640
a specific way and now when you're seeing other people who are trying to live differently they use that against

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:12.660
you they point out those people who do not follow these strict laws that have been forced upon you in an abusive

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:18.060
controlling way and they make you hate those people who refuse and we all

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:24.240
should be refusing to follow because this this kind of Oppression is the problem and we got to be really weary

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:30.240
like I was watching TV the other day and Charlie cook Kirk came on the news and

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:36.480
he was talking about how they needed to take people like me out and hang them by the trees like they used to do in the

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:41.520
1940s that's that's where this is going right now and Putin is saying the same

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:48.900
thing he literally just went on TV and was saying that the West is trying to make God by gendered pretty sure God is

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:57.420
beyond gender like give me a break yeah hey Rob from the Rob from England across

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:04.500
the way so we've got Canada we've got Canada's word we've got America's word what does England tell us

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:11.339
um tell us about this movement I mean some we just had a we just had an Insurrection Rob what give us some

00:47:11.339 --> 00:47:16.859
advice from England tough it's tough to give advice for

00:47:16.859 --> 00:47:25.020
England you know and you only we only hear what we hear and so I interpret he says

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:30.599
as with this um presentation you've done with the comments made like I said how

00:47:30.599 --> 00:47:35.880
did you launch a thousand ships we call it uh the face that launched a

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:43.680
thousand ships but was it the face that launched that thousand ships was it a sacrifice that launched the

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:50.339
thousand ships and he wanted then thousand ships launched in the first place and what was his game and what was he up

00:47:50.339 --> 00:47:58.920
to because that's basically what this guy is doing it he's using corrupt

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:03.960
means for gain power that's all I can see and I can't see

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:09.240
much else in politics if I managed with you completely as there's

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:15.300
far too much corruption involved for me to weed through and try and Peck out

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:21.540
some sort of Hope there because from my point of view the trained the

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:27.359
train then lies and deceits they're not technicians they don't get anything done they don't

00:48:27.359 --> 00:48:34.859
produce anything worth of value and I haven't got much time for them to

00:48:34.859 --> 00:48:40.260
be honest um how that affects America and what you've got to do is

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:48.720
I don't know tearing off your TVs okay now each of you now each of you

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:54.060

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:07.560

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:12.720
for for each year right what's the message you're getting Chewie could you

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:19.260
play that please everybody in the world knows that men don't think very much of women who are

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:27.240
easy women who are easy having a virtuous wife is being like a

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:33.780
rich man with big sack of rubies your husband is blessed God is favoring him

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:41.400
by providing a wife providing you for this man easy easy is the ruler of this

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:46.500
world these titles and many more signify Satan's capabilities we must remember

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:51.660
that God has given him domain over unbelievers only Believers are no longer

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:58.680
under the rule of Satan unbelievers on the other hand are caught in the snare of the devil lie in the power of the

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:03.720
evil one and are in bondage to Satan Satan is the God of this world it's not

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:10.619
saying that he has ultimate Authority it is conveying the idea that Satan rules over the unbelieving world in a specific

00:50:10.619 --> 00:50:16.220
way these bad guys at Corinth are Satan

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.780
self-righteous respectability that is the that's the Beating Heart of Satanism

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:27.720
abortion God has forgiven it porn sites God has forgiven it and we think oh you're starting to introduce moral chaos

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:34.380
no forgiveness of sin is not moral chaos but I believe that God has built men to

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:41.819
engage with the world and God has built women to be domestic between Presbyterians and twerking drag

00:50:41.819 --> 00:50:48.540
queens is not to display an adverb of neutrality this only happens when the state has decided to decide with the

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:55.800
kinky tribe Plus [Applause] foreign everybody in the world knows that men

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.900
don't think very much of women who are easy

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:09.960
so I'll start with a com with a 30 second comment and what I took from that

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:17.099
is I would not let man ever teaching my daughter uh Rob you're up next what do

00:51:17.099 --> 00:51:22.980
you think uh been on every NLP course you could go

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:28.880
on um weird associations and they're all dropped in there all all on some sort of

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:37.380
scheme or Daft way of winning your favor in some fashion appealing to from sure to

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:43.740
misguarded loyalties to the church or to being domesticated or being as

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:49.559
be that's misguarded it's completely misguided

00:51:49.559 --> 00:51:57.780
dominated from Rob fantastic Snappy you're Eric I see weak inept men that are terrified

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:04.500
of the power of women and have to abuse and control them and subjugate them for their own Amusement it's beyond

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:13.980
disgusting all right from Snappy subjugation excellent phoniest what's your take

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:20.339
I see it as them trying to take away the power of the woman they want this dominant masculine thing to go on they

00:52:20.339 --> 00:52:27.000
fear the woman like Snappy said and I also see how the non-believers of that you don't believe in their God

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:33.359
you're a Satanist so they want you to be dependent on their God or you're they're going to label you as evil and they don't understand even what they believe

00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:38.400
in or Satan at that yeah then that's the perfect that's the

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:45.359
perfect way to end this because aren't we just just in view of the fact that we're their natural enemy right because

00:52:45.359 --> 00:52:53.579
I'm not going to stand with a group that wants to that wants to take a a group be it a gender or be it an ethnic group or

00:52:53.579 --> 00:52:59.220
or whatever people with people with glasses I don't care any anybody that

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:07.380
wants to take a group and either torture or destroy that group um those are not Defenders of the virgin

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:13.319
they do not know the great mother so who do we stand against I know one

00:53:13.319 --> 00:53:19.800
thing we stand against these guys and if we can do anything with our magic we do

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:25.380
it against them yeah thank you guys for coming tonight hail Satan thanks for

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:32.640
