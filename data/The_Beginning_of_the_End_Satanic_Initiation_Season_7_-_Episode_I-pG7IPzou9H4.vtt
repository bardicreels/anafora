walking around and people are saying is he the Christ they understand what that means

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:17.440
it's filtered into their society all the way down to the marketplace where they're going to buy their

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.600
drugs fantastic especially if they're

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:29.720
civilized out in the provinces there's no Market there they take that stuff and they ship it back to

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:35.640

to blaze up from the offerings on on the sappy Pine uh-oh uhoh we all know what

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:42.600
happens when you put this stuff and you know it's combustible sweat covered all his body and the robe clung to his sides

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:51.880
as if glued by a Craftsman to every joint and from his very bones shot up spasmodic stinging pains the poison like

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:57.960
some detested bloody snakes devoured him

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:06.559

00:30:12.679 --> 00:30:18.279
species for the sake of alleviating the

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:25.039

Islam they all go back to an earlier mystery cult that was popular in the

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:56.760
Bronze Age right and became especially influential at the end of it if you were

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:05.039
to write a history of the world's religions you'd have to say that this Bronze Age religion was kind of the

00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:11.039
precursor of everything you've got now so the terms that you've got like Christ

00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:16.840

in Parables and he said to them right in this teaching um keep go keep going uh

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:19.119
next place yeah and um he called them all together yeah into Parables um um

00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:25.240
and spoke to them in Parables excuse me Paul do not how he says in a parable in

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:30.800
a parable in a parable why is this man this lce days with his

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:36.640
12 children because remember the apostles are all teenagers they're ma

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:44.480
Thai they're ma Thai and nobody oh my God no Peter's not a teenager is Peter a

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:53.800
teenager when Jesus is with him naked in the upper room yeah yeah Ma students

00:35:53.800 --> 00:36:00.960
they're just students just like Socrates man you used to it it's ancient High School you you didn't know Jesus was an

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:06.119
ancient High School cult leader yeah he was he was he like the

00:36:06.119 --> 00:36:13.160
orphans yes prostitutes and the tax people you can

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:19.319
see that let's go everybody knows that they're like shut up and hurry up listen here's the other one um I'm going to

00:36:19.319 --> 00:36:25.760
take you back now we took you to the Alpha and the Omega and we took you to somebody speaking in Parables and now I

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:31.440
want to translate for is some John ltis he says hey there was this kid tagay the

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:36.599
one who was born from the soil right there was a farmer out working in his

00:36:36.599 --> 00:36:41.720
field and this kid just came right out of one of the little grooves he had

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:47.720
plowed in the ground he just came out of it and I'm G to translate for it they

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:54.160
call this guy tages they the Greeks call him thoni and Hermes see that the top

00:36:54.160 --> 00:37:01.280
Greek students that Topline middle they call him konian Hermes this boy who comes out of the

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:07.440
ground and and you know what just like uh you know prus the teacher right he

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:14.920
says this right and what is he how do they talk about this um um thing well

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:21.400
it's heretic they use herotic speecher allegorically they talk about things why

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:29.640
because it's the law it's the nomos of the priests to do that right

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:37.440
yeah since why because it's not right to make things visible that have to do with

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:44.280
God in a way that is not holy you can't do that that's what it says in the red

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:53.400
right but now because of this they use myth and they tell

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:58.880
Parables they tell Parables for example let me give you an example instead of

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:06.640
saying the soul has been initiated given all

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:14.119
power it is incarnated in the flesh instead of saying all that right

00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:20.240
what's they say what there's a kid and he's a newborn kid he's a young kid and

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:28.599
he comes out of the dirt that's plowed by this farmer do you understand understand okay

00:38:28.599 --> 00:38:34.920
those of you who are sitting here when Jesus is using this method and he's

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:41.280
telling people no it's I've certain people that I've called I've called you

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:47.280
here whether you want to be here or not whether it tortures your soul and I love

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:53.520
that you're drawn I love that even though you love Jesus and you want to

00:38:53.520 --> 00:39:01.000
defend him you know that you can't the evidence is all gone you can't have your

00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:15.800
Jesus if this is the right one you know he could have been 10 years

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:21.680

they weren't from us directly why not why not because if they were they you

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:31.760
know they would still be here they would still be here because you can't make a

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:37.200
Christ or an antichrist unless you have a body to do

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:43.000
so you can't wait say that again you can't make a Christ or an antichrist

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:51.000
unless you have a body eat my flesh drink my

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.599
blood it's the chemistry people it's the chemistry the seed of Christ Christ is

00:44:56.599 --> 00:45:02.640
called the love of God and guess what that word for seed it's the same as the

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:12.440
Seaman there was an ancient drug called the love of God what was it it was the semen of the

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:17.559

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:52.040
most common routs you got going from Rio from Rio and it is specifically medical

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:57.880

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:05.720
one the very last one I need to see chewy yeah hello lady who is that did we

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:12.119

00:48:29.559 --> 00:48:35.240
ended up buried you know don't worry about it watch this catap plasto what is

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:40.760
it when you catap plasto something right when something is has been what

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:46.040
plastered plastered look at the um about halfway and it says pharmacon catap

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:53.559
plaston it's a type of drug a catap plaston pharmacon a category of drug and

00:48:53.559 --> 00:48:59.440
it equals the cataplasma which like me if you've been into ancient medicine oh

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:06.680
you know what a cataplasm is right they've got that both sides Greek and Roman right it's a skin plaster that you

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:11.760
use right medicated skin plaster a lot of them have really strong substances

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:17.000
them but blow that up again um look at what it says after plaster it says as

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.880
opposed to aista and a PO aista that's Jesus Christ in the in the

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:32.520
feminine yeah no it's um things that are applied as Christo things that are applied as a

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:38.119
Christos and things that are po things that are drunk things that are drunk so

00:49:38.119 --> 00:49:44.760
these are just different ways of applying medicine now I want I want you bring up some images mind changing

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:51.119
images right hit the right system there right white weapons you got it on good

00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:57.119
um um these different categories you didn't know that a Christ was a type of

00:49:57.119 --> 00:50:03.480
medicine did you a a a means of application you didn't know that did you

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:12.200
did you know that it's these plasters these inations they use that word um these

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:18.359
inations that these are penetrated um bandages that have

00:50:18.359 --> 00:50:25.680
medicines in them you can have plasters or you can have incrustations or you can have pobles

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:31.720
Ables they're just different ways to get poisons into your body and um you know

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:38.760
because that's the thing that's what they're doing I don't know how many texts I've shown you in Seven Seasons

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:44.119
but it's we're up to hundreds of people we're up to hundreds and I'm you know

00:50:44.119 --> 00:50:50.960
we're not even on the surface of the drugs right so this is a lot I know this is a lot you're all absorbing this and

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:57.400
people are saying it's a lot of information I've got to go back that's I'm trying to packet for you though so

00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:04.559
that you know you can pleasure you can have the pleasure of you know following it but here let's go because we got we

00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:10.720
don't have time we need to get through Alpha and we need to bring as many people through as possible hit that go

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:17.079
for it okay people let's just pull out the horse the Hipp atrica and what does it say it says this guy named absurdus

00:51:17.079 --> 00:51:22.240
which is nice because media's brother had this name absurdist so it's kind of

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:28.040
a black sea region name you know and is this about well he wrote he wrote a

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:36.040
section of his work about Mania remember he is a hiatos he's a horse doctor and

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:42.400
he's writing about Mania how are we going to treat Mania in the horses and I just want you to notice talks about a

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:49.400
couple of other authors we've got Yus no nobody's ever heard of these nobody's ever heard of these Jesus Christ may

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:56.160
have heard of these but none of you none of us none of us

00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:01.520
right oh God I love it right so when somebody comes on board and say no he's

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:06.839
qualified for this you realize those people have never even fought they've

00:52:06.839 --> 00:52:12.400
never even considered the possibility of the existence of this there's 800 pages

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:18.920
of this people oh God it's got the christing oh let's go back to it love it

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:24.680
look at this okay what are you going to put into it um well this is another one

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:30.240
um but but let go back to the first one yeah because I want you to see the bottom line look this is for the look at

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:36.119
that last line tant what's happening to your horse your

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:42.400
horse is getting ladic they're getting a little bit of mania so you have to have

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:48.400
the right therapy for your horse and what is some of the stuff they're giving them are you ready you g to love these

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:56.920
people look they're giving them cannabis they're giving them cannabis right there yeah look there there it is

00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:03.119
in the Greek people are like oh were they using cannabis in the temple

00:53:03.119 --> 00:53:08.400
no but they're using it everywhere else and

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:13.440
they're even giving it to their horses and they're making skin applications of

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:19.319
it as well isn't that nice make a nice oil that you will rub into the skin of

00:53:19.319 --> 00:53:24.760
your horse all over it right oh and you got to make a plaster because when you

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:31.440
bed your horse they can get FL um an infection translated it's just an

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:37.119
inflammation and so you've got to you don't bleed your horse let's wait which

00:53:37.119 --> 00:53:46.000
I know she's out there you bleed your horse I'm looking for you um this is the first of seven right go okay and what

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:54.880
what else besides the Cannabis um you know just your standard list of drugs heliotropic yeah no it's all tialon nron

00:53:54.880 --> 00:54:01.040
yeah these are all good standard drugs what's interesting about it is that they're drugs that they're using on

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:07.720
humans as well drugs that they're using in ritual so in Antiquity they're using

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:12.839
with their horses the same drugs that they're using remember if you're a cyan

00:54:12.839 --> 00:54:18.240
you don't bathe you don't bathe in water you bathe in the fumes of

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:24.839
cannabis that's how you take a bath you fumigate in cannabis so it kind of makes

00:54:24.839 --> 00:54:31.319
sense that all these people who are fum getting up in the morning and fumigating themselves with cannabis they're they're

00:54:31.319 --> 00:54:36.839
also giving cannabis to their horses it kind of makes sense maybe it's a

00:54:36.839 --> 00:54:45.280
connection thing I don't know I don't know maybe horses get stressed horse PTSD they gotta have

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:50.599
they're gotta get PTSD just like the rest of us right maybe they need it okay

00:54:50.599 --> 00:54:57.880
let's go to the next one he's going to pull it ride out of the horse right okay are you

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:05.839
ready they got as best as here her I just wanted you to see that there's the Roki again there's more there's more

00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:11.559
cannabis yeah these are all for different we're just going through different affections right different

00:55:11.559 --> 00:55:18.880
sorts of problems health problems and we're coming up with a whole bunch of curatives keep going excellent right oh

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:25.240
God look at this one I just want you to look at the first line This is the um on

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:31.520
the making the hypocrates on the making of the um

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:39.599
trois the um the lenes right the trois the little it's a

00:55:39.599 --> 00:55:44.640

you can take that wine you can flush it into your rectum that's a direct infusion they call it right direct

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:58.799
infusion and what are these used for these are used um prasan malen now um I

00:55:58.799 --> 00:56:04.760
can throw this text in front of any classicist or in front of any Bible

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:10.440
scholar and they won't be able to read um the terms here because this is highly

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:15.799
technical what is molus right what is molus it's horse

make right now you and I with our horses because we're not that smart we would have gone out to the marketplace and we

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:45.599
would have talked to the Hipp arroy we said hey um what do I give to you know I

00:56:45.599 --> 00:56:52.400
