now tell me something Paul tell me something Paul stop crying stop crying Paul

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.580
yeah yeah that's that's where we are

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:01.199
you know we've got Paul the Apostle here and he belongs to us and he is saying

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:07.259
if you are a dudette do not apply

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:13.139
right right and now that we have mixed I mean

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:21.060
some some women stepped up and became teachers

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.660
and now we have a problem we have a problem because you see the

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:35.280
whole cult as reformed by Paul his particular brand

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.979
flavor and it runs through Catholicism when it runs through protestantism

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:47.699
it runs through all the isms love it it runs through that girl sitting on her

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:55.020
bed praying Jesus Jesus I love you and I know that you died for my sins

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.060

right through her

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.600
ladies get out of the market says Saint Paul

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.720
I don't let any woman teach over me

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.300
yeah I don't appoint any of them nope no women you got women what does it say

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.199
from the time says the handsome women who stepped up right says they had some women who

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:36.419
stepped up and Paul didn't like it Paul didn't like it but this is the Divine

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:43.860
word of God it's the Divine word of God so what are we to believe nothing we're

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:51.060

um I have set up a deposition

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:28.260

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:36.600
the plaintiff appears I was a plaintiff yes certain things have been redacted

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:44.160
foreign of the innocent involved

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:50.279
yeah definitely definitely and tonight I want to bring you a section of that so I'm going to

00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:56.940
set the setting here um it is Professor suing University for

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:03.300
false termination after the American Association of University professors

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:09.779
sent to delegation to investigate and they came to the conclusion that I was

00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:16.800
falsely terminated yeah and Saint Mary's went on the top 10

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:23.279
schools for lacking any concern for free speech of USA Today

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:28.800
right I want to play you this clip I have now come to the office building we

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:35.100
have been fighting this war for three years to get them to turn over email to

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:40.260
us that's concerning me that they're refusing to do under court order they're

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.360
refusing to do it and we're pushing pushing pushing to get the court to kick

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:51.420
in and give us this access we're right up at that point now it's time for my deposition

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:57.600
I drive 12 hours 12 hours to a deposition

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:04.320
yeah yeah and this was some of the questioning some of the questioning

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.019
we'll be talking more in the future about sacraments and about accusations I

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:15.240
just want you to know this is a Catholic University

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:22.139
with a very strong Catholic Brothers

00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:28.440
um Seminary and diocesal magnificence of the

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.959
of the beauty and pageantry yeah it was the

00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:39.420
it was a deal after I was investigated me for demon possession without me being

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:45.959
there this is what I want to bring you cut it let's see the uh let's see the clip and

00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:52.440
if it comes out well great both believe it was unjust so we talked

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:58.740
about how the response the response from professors other professors and the fear

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:06.120
and the climate at St Mary's a lot of professors have approached or several professors I should say have approached

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:12.899
blank and acknowledged that we're sorry we're afraid to stand up for Hillman

00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:18.120
because the administration is so heavy-handed and we'll fire them

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.160
but that has nothing to do with your case right no I think that's everything

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:29.459
in my case no it's not what's your case about my case is about Saint Mary's

00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:34.620
attempting to convince a student that I had raped her and she knew told them

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:40.740
that I had not and this case is about their attempt paint me as a

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.899
so that they could get rid of me which student is that blank

00:16:45.899 --> 00:16:51.480
is your case about anything else I would say my case is about freedom of speech

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:56.519
and freedom of religion but about the tendency to try to stifle things

00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:01.800
from ancient literature that make us uncomfortable because of our current religious

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:09.380
perspective explain what to you

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:17.480
so because of our judeo-christian heritage culture

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:26.640
some of the things that the Greeks and Romans believes and followed and the ways that they set up their society we

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:32.400
find them hard to understand so we try to stifle their teaching in

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.500
order to make ourselves more comfortable and I believe it's my duty to these

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:43.740
ancient texts to the Muse sure okay

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:49.500
I believe it's my duty to reveal these texts or teach these texts to students

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:56.000
does that explain it what is it that you're trying to teach the students

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.080
institutions not necessarily Saint Mary's but generally estheticians find difficult

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.960
well I'm not trying to teach them anything I want to give them Cicero I want to

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:15.360
give them Herodotus trying to teach them the authors I don't

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.419
have an agenda except to give the students the materials so they can say oh

00:18:21.419 --> 00:18:27.900
this is what Cicero says about government or this is what thucydides says about

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:34.260
tyranny well this is what euripides says about greed

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:42.000
my job is not to teach belief or an ideal or a philosophy I'm not a

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:50.400
theologian my job is to open up Greek and Latin texts and say this is what they say you

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:57.240
have an issue issue with corporate greed correct

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:03.600
I don't have an issue like it I tend to Parrot Antiquities

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:10.919
understanding that greed is the one Vice that will destroy Civic Society Civil

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:18.780
Society excuse me believe that Vice is penetrated into the

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:23.539
educational institutions yes

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:31.380
okay that was enlightening a section just a section of

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:37.500
a seven and a half hour deposition in which I was

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:44.220
um brought to a crescendo of a lawyer screaming at me

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:51.299

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:58.440

what is that it's worship it's worship how do you think you get these things to

00:28:55.799 --> 00:29:02.159
work without some form of worship we know that the universe is based on that

00:29:02.159 --> 00:29:08.640
you know it's based upon some fabric of information yeah

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.860

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:20.820

isn't that nice isn't that nice sexual excitation due to religious

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:06.480
fervor that's having the experience that's why we don't have the frustration

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:13.679

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:18.799
it right as soon as you take out the temples the Aphrodite you're gonna

00:30:18.799 --> 00:30:24.380
crumble you're not gonna have any Democratic influence whatsoever

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:31.200
whatsoever she was maintaining that divide she was maintaining it historically and you guys shot it down

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.600
you got shot down no one of the Oracle died yeah that's it

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:42.600
that's it no more for you this is sad makes me sad let's keep reading because

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.820
this is It's Gonna you know kind of get crazy he says he wants to remind them

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:54.299
you know he says knowing that at one time at one time Jesus Christ

00:30:54.299 --> 00:31:00.120
took you out of Egypt wait what who did

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.320
Jesus did

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:11.220
Jesus Christ took some people out of Egypt yeah and what did he do after he

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:17.960
took him out of Egypt on this excursion what did he do

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:23.159
he uh killed him wait wait I'm sorry he said stop

00:31:23.159 --> 00:31:28.500
he did what he did what he killed him

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:36.299
why because they turned around decided his junk did not fly with them

00:31:36.299 --> 00:31:43.020
yeah so he killed them all welcome to Jesus Christ

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:49.140
uh if you didn't know that this was in Jude it's because every sermon that you

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:54.659
go look up right now the popular ones that get sixty thousand hits

00:31:54.659 --> 00:32:01.020
um at a time and within a week let's say those I don't know if you don't think that's popular then you know I don't

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:06.539
know I think that's a lot of people when that happens

00:32:06.539 --> 00:32:12.899
when that word gets out there there's no penetration of the reality that's in the

00:32:12.899 --> 00:32:19.559
text there is a fairy tale if you watch sermons and people are always asking me

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:25.679
well not always but they've asked me why do you listen to them

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:31.080
this stuff why do you listen to Jewel Osteen number one because it's great

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:36.600
great entertainment but these are historical data points

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:44.220
that you can trace what's happening now and predict what's happening in what's

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:50.580
you expect to happen in the future yeah it's very oracular process it's

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:55.679
fantastic but you have to you have to go to the elements for it so that's what

00:32:55.679 --> 00:33:01.980
they're doing they're diving in these people that come up into their Agape Feast did you know that Romans were

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:07.799
arresting Christians for agape face that he's talking about

00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:15.559
where we're going to and you say why amen why would you bring that up

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:24.179
because I find it interesting that the Romans would find themselves in

00:33:24.179 --> 00:33:30.539
the positions they administrate their empire that they would find themselves in a

00:33:30.539 --> 00:33:36.899
position that they have to break up certain gatherings certain religious

00:33:36.899 --> 00:33:45.600
gatherings for treasonous activity and for mothers having sex with

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:51.000
their children to the Romans that was completely off right you want to have

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.399
your orguia you want to have your orgies your religious performances you know

00:33:56.399 --> 00:34:02.399
where the Arches are you know where the temples are where all of that stuff is done

00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:10.378
right there's no reason to hide it anywhere the women who started the power

00:34:10.379 --> 00:34:16.500
through wait who was it who was that lady who

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:22.980
brought the Latin she brought Latin she brought Latin she had Greek but she

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:28.800
brought Latin to Rome before there was this hot on the place

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:34.378
yeah she brought Latin so that those people

00:34:34.379 --> 00:34:39.540
could write their own language Out imagine her you know what they call her

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:48.839
they call her the Roman Muse carminta carminta the Roman Muse and and what

00:34:48.839 --> 00:34:54.898
what was she in Nigeria what did they first do what was their cult this oldest

00:34:54.899 --> 00:35:00.240
of oldest of cults right this oldest of Colts

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.720
of the Muse what what did they bring what did they bring they brought that

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:14.579
Oracle they brought that Oracle and with it they built civilization

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:22.040
whether they built civilization and they did so as

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:28.680
what was her occupation I'm sorry I couldn't hear that what was her occupant yeah midwife

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:37.320
Midwife the drugs always go back to the midwives right they always go back to

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:47.400
the midwives the oldest ones so we have caught people this is designed by and

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:52.520
for midwives to create

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:59.640
civilization this is the stew of the Bronze Age

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:05.579
this is the stew and this is what we're seeing reflected through these sources

00:36:05.579 --> 00:36:12.780
even through this guy yeah even through Jude even through Jude

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:18.060
now we were just with Jesus Ryan Jesus was bringing people out of Egypt and

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:27.780
then they turned against them so Jesus killed them all right it's what Jude says don't look at me and say Moses

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:35.220
right we all know his name comes from the muse yeah who do you think has the snake on

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:44.760
the pole right what you're telling me Judaism there's a Bronze Age mystery cult yes

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:50.880
yes Judaism developed from older cultures as

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:57.240
far back as the calcolithic pulaskians performing the ritual

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:04.800
yeah which turns out involves a lot a lot of drugs and it ends up staining the

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.140
language with all the drugs that it's using right fantastic okay let me just

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:16.740
there was a couple of more things I don't want to take up too much of your time I just wanted to bring it uh

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:22.200
together and I wanted you to know

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.480
that our warning is you know

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:35.880
the Angels right so you've got Lucifer who is the most beautiful right and he

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:42.420
takes down with him a third right a third of the other angels with

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:49.680
him and everybody knows that here where you and I are this is Satan's belongs to

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:55.520
him yeah belongs to him and even that little

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:01.560
even that guy Michael take that down for a second this is one of the most disgraceful

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:09.839
right acts he is a who am I am I the accuser tonight I am

00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:15.060
um it was about the body of Moses it was about the body of Moses

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:22.980
and the funny thing was Heaven didn't get possession of it because Michael was sent

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:29.940
to do a job and didn't do it and why Michael because Michael was scared bro

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:34.980
when you have angels in your enforcers

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:43.619
who are scared you got problems bro dragon dragon fears nobody

00:38:43.619 --> 00:38:48.900
but Medea fears nobody but that Queen

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:56.099
Dragon fears nobody but that queen that he serves isn't that nice oh that's nice I love

00:38:56.099 --> 00:39:02.579
that I love that and that's why you get it preserved over time you get the mystery preserved over time

00:39:02.579 --> 00:39:09.540

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:15.900
yeah I want to point you to the way of Kane and along the path to the way of Cain

and I don't I value time

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:07.079
can we just look at for a second the fact that these ways

00:41:07.079 --> 00:41:14.539
are ways involving body fluids and rituals and sex

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:23.099
they were getting all sort of oils somebody was screaming about the consecration oils and somebody else said

00:41:23.099 --> 00:41:29.460
hey do you know there's a formula for this thing dude I cannot remember

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:36.960
all the consecration oils that I saw the recipes for the ones that I like are the

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:44.099
ones that the priestesses of Aphrodite used you know what they got in there they got fangs to stop you from getting

00:41:44.099 --> 00:41:49.500
sick they got what they got stuff that will

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:54.140
kill what you get

00:41:54.780 --> 00:42:00.839
down there in your reproductive Zone

00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:07.680
yeah The Matrix of existence people say you know it's look at how

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:14.760
your languages look look at the uterus right like what is there how do they perceive the uterus right you're gonna

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:20.880
see how they end up treating women right and nobody cares about why is nobody

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:26.760
care about those women around the Black Sea why does nobody care about those women

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:33.540
around the Black Sea I don't get it they were creating everything they had

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:39.780
the knowledge the knowledge that burned in the Bronze Age filtered down through

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:46.980
these genius women who were using chemicals to transform people to keep

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:53.460
people alive during childbirth to heal disease and

00:42:53.460 --> 00:43:00.000
all right to take you from an everyday person and

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.460
turn you into a born again cultist

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:12.240
with a vision that you can never release you can never release once you've been

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:18.560
there imagine if I came to you and said and you said how was it

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:24.540
and I'd have to say since I'm talking to you I'd have to say wow I mean this

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:32.220
whole death thing scared scared me right but once I was there and saw what I saw

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:39.720
the whole Resurrection was like oh I put it into a place that makes me no longer

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:46.200
fear what is going on in life right and that is what Jude's contention

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:52.079
is they have run after the nature look what they're doing people they're

00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:57.780
running after the nature do you know that the mystery the

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:04.380
religions that created Judaism and Christianity and Islam did you know

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:09.599
those monotheistic sign rivulets all

00:44:09.599 --> 00:44:17.280
come from a place where nature is Central you must have a great mother

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:24.060
if you don't you don't belong here right somebody get the we got another

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:31.440
atis we got another Addis right he must undergo the transformation

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:37.319
imagine if I don't know if you could see a group of women

00:44:37.319 --> 00:44:44.280
with this power and remember the archers are the at the time that's the

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:50.280
unbeatable technology right and those women who are on the

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:56.700
horses around the Black Sea those women are ferocious they have to kill three

00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:02.280
people before they can have a a situation where they'll produce

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:10.319
Offspring nobody produces offspring unless you got three and if you want to get rid of your guy you know that's up

00:45:10.319 --> 00:45:16.440
to you right do you see the power there do you see

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:22.740
the power there and from that they built the society that is buried underneath

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:30.780
the Christian one that was built on top yeah it's absolutely gorgeous it's

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:36.480
absolutely gorgeous yeah and what I think that we're gonna have to do

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:44.460
is find these texts in their native original habitats

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:51.000
so that we can put together the broader picture of what is coming and what we

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.740
need to do just keep bear this in mind the Great

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:04.560
Etruscan civils worked under a system that viewed that

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:13.380
Central Authority or God if you will as a woman who possessed the knowledge

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:19.200
of the drugs she was able

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:25.500
to control her own body hence her own

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:32.119
destiny yeah isn't that amazing

00:46:32.119 --> 00:46:39.000
hmm makes you think could they have made those advances without those daughters I

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:45.480
don't think they could have made the advances with as much of the drugs that I've seen in the text I don't think this

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:51.540
is you're gonna have to have a whole bunch of people involved over a whole

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:58.520
long time yeah you're gonna have to have tried and true

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:04.380
especially when you're talking about antidotes right bring somebody back from a snake venom

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:10.980

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:16.020
