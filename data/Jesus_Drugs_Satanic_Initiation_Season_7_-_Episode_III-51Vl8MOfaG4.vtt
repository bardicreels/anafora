Institute let's go to the source next one boom bring this up I wanted you guys

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:37.879
to see this this is a little bit of the Bible I'm just going to read it quickly you know and after this Jesus knew that

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:44.720
everything was done right in order that you know it might be

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.800
fulfilled yeah what what could possibly be fulfilled you know that which was

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:57.199
written yeah so what did he say he says deep soul I am thirsty because he had to

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:02.280
that was his Q right there's a certain there's a certain amount of performance

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:08.520
in the mystery people didn't you know that we're going to see it tonight um we're back here with Jesus and there was

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.800
this pot there and it's full of the oxus and I'm going to tell you I'm not going

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:20.319
to translate that word tonight you can say oxus or you can say

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:25.479
oxos so um there he is you know um I'm

00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:31.039
thirsty and there was this pot there and somebody came along and dipped a sponge

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:38.039
remember there's a whole bunch of women around the cross right somebody came along and

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:43.680
dipped in that sponge you know using applying some hiss up they put it up and

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:51.800
and gave it to him right at his mouth and when he took that o sauce Jesus said

00:08:51.800 --> 00:09:00.360
it's done and he leaned back his head he leaned back his head and he gave

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:06.120
out his breath he gave out his breath take it down that's how the ancient

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:13.839
Greeks said you die you die you die what is that Jesus doing

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:19.480
he's hanging there on the cross and he is

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.240
dying and he drinks something that they give him now what I'm going to do with

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:31.680
you now is I'm going to take you bring that lovely crucifix up there we need to see that except we should be able to see

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.440
his privates we should have covered Jesus's privates with cross wouldn't that'd be

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:45.360
funny you could cover Jesus's privates instead of with a little towel with a cross with another little Jesus nailed

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:52.680
to the cross and what was on Jesus who was nailed to the cross what was on his privates another little Jesus nailed to

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:59.519
a cross you see and then we'll never make it on time let's just people can we

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:05.720
just okay look what I'm doing I'm buying time because I'm sucking up the ghost of

talking once with a famous dude Carl Ruck trying to figure

00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:43.360
out is it is it an act that requires

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:50.960
extra you know is it a feet of strength it's a pull apart a bull can you pull apart a human being

00:21:50.960 --> 00:22:00.080
with your hands I I think it can be done but it helps if you are in a state of

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:05.559
enthusiasm if you have that anotic substance on board and you're pumping in

00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:11.400
a little bit of that Mania imagine right imagine these are the

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:19.159
people we're talking about you thought you went you go to church and you think this is a real mystery and you sit there

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.039
a history of junkies Jesus Christ was a

00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:50.120
junkie to the death to the death now

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:59.000

there we got to lift up that Serpent and anybody who looks at it they're

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:21.360
saved yeah and you wondered why they said he's casting out demons by the power of the

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:27.039
devil right um Moses that's who we're talking

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:32.120
about right Moses and all of his thing that he's doing um he's doing the very

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:38.279
same thing right he is written in the third century and as a character he is

00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:46.120
doing the very same thing right you wonder why Jesus and his

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:51.960
boys right by the way it's a little bit people are like huh all the apostles are

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.600
teenage boys well not all of them some of them are like 10 to 12 right so you

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:03.000
you know give him a break there do you know how good it feels to

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.960
say that do you know how good it's why is that one invulnerable why is that

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:14.399
fact invulnerable you can't you can't deny it they were young right right and

00:27:14.399 --> 00:27:19.640
everybody says oh Peter was married no it's the word for female in-law it could

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:26.679
be his sister-in-law yeah yeah and there's no other record and by the way he's naked

00:27:26.679 --> 00:27:32.440
on boats with other kids at night yeah when Jesus gets there he

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.559
throws on his underwear yeah these are the boys from

00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:46.000
Galilee isn't it funny that history gives us the boys of Galilee the

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.200
young boy prostitutes of Jesus the

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:58.799
trafficker that's what history gives us and what do we turn it into with our

00:27:58.799 --> 00:28:05.039
minds what do we create for ourselves the picture of no no no these are all

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:12.360
old bearded men and they're at this table sitting did you ever notice how the Last Supper doesn't feel right I

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:19.399
just want to remind you of one thing when Jesus gave them the contact for the

00:28:19.399 --> 00:28:24.799
upper room because they needed somewhere out of the way to take their for Jesus

00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:30.799
to take his 12 boys to he needed a place that was out of the way and in order to

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:37.120
find this place he gave instructions he didn't give the dude's name nobody ever

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:45.840
figures out who's the saint who was that shady guy that directed the kids to the

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:51.600
room Jesus said he'll be holding a water jar be holding this big water jug just

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:58.080
go to him you'll see him there in the street it's like dude he had his

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:03.279
business set up he had his business set up he's not a lace St you know what

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:09.519
Jesus worried about at night when he went to bed he worried about getting

00:29:09.519 --> 00:29:16.440
caught and he runs out in the Garden of Gethsemane at 4:00 A.M ah I'm not a

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:23.440
child trafficker okay well now we're with him on a cross a few hours later and now you

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:31.039
understand why people are so angry all of a sudden there's crowds there's

00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:37.559
crowds screaming out get rid of him dude so they do they crucify him and he's

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:46.799
there when they crucify him being offered according to nonas that very communal

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:52.000
thec that thing to round out the the

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.880
right that thing that balances the right why because his people know no he's on

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:06.640
it he's on it and what does he do he goes right into the death State don't

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:12.000
you know that's what we do those of us who work by the power of Satan don't you

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.640
know that's what we do we put you into a death State and raise you back to life

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:25.080
again and you walk around a new and it does something for you up here it gives

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:31.279
you perspective that you didn't have before well he goes right into it he goes right

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:39.200
into death right into death somebody asked me recently they

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:45.840
said almond do you think that the death is the you know how far did they go into

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:51.440
it um was he sitting there I I can't answer that except with what I've seen

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:58.720
and I'm not going to BS you guys because I don't have anything to profit off of this

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:05.000
yeah they had drugs to put you into a state they call them thosa into a state

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000
that looked like death that you could have somebody come into the room and not be able to get a pulse pulse is Big

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.600
right these people are not stupid um and they wouldn't you know they wouldn't be

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:27.919
able to notice any visible signs of of um of living is especially

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:35.000
breathing can make it look like you're not respirating at all yeah they're using paralytics and

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.080
stuff like that people but these same drugs they have antidotes for that will

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:46.760
bring you back so when nonas is talking about antidotes there realize that this

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:53.600
is a sophisticated pharmacology this is poly Pharmacy I was just reading today

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:05.680
no this is that Priestess that gives life this is she with the aquaa if you'd

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:12.480
asked me Baptist I'd have told you but now you have this on your

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:20.680
bottom yes oh I know why they do that now I know why the Bonin do that right

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:27.680
because it brings you to a place it's invigorating it's good exercise

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:33.560
it feels like the lubia once again you ever go to the lubric Calia right oh

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:39.640
this kid went up he was absolutely he was an Adonis he was

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:46.400
an Adonis and he had that he had that that flail in his hand that that

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:51.920
strap and he went up and she he went up to the girl that he was just been

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:59.880
following around for the last year and he hit her so hard with that and she

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:07.800
tore open her breast and he just hit her over and over and do you know why why

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:13.880
are they doing stuff like this it's goat stuff it's the

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:20.119
tragedy right it's the tragedy right that gets my goat that

00:40:20.119 --> 00:40:25.560
gets my goat the tragedy that we have left out the tragedy out of our society

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:32.359
we've put a cross over it now now what we really what we really worship is that

00:40:32.359 --> 00:40:37.400
guy being crucified right let's go back to him you

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:43.000
didn't know Jesus got stoned while he was dying did you it's okay though

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:51.720
because they had drugs of Revival yeah the thcs people they had

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:58.800
drugs that could bring you back don't you realize Jesus could have gone back to the tomb they could have taken him to

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.920
a tomb doesn't matter if they broke his legs he'd be in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shape for a while

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.680
um but he he wasn't dead yet he did get stabbed a little bit he get he got air

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:15.839
rated right and all the water he's drinking because been thirsty ah how long do you think it

00:41:15.839 --> 00:41:22.160
would have taken the question is could they have gotten him back and revived

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:29.040
before now that now that would be an interesting question and maybe that's why that little kid is there in the

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:35.000
tombs and what is the kid wearing he's wearing ceremonial stuff seriously yeah

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.800
for what kind of Ceremonies death Cults you bonee head death Cults the Mysteries

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:47.720
are death Cults they have to be death and Resurrection if I can't put you into

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:56.240
that state see ancient Christians they weren't Faith your faith they were going

00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:01.560
going through it they were being put into the death and brought out because

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:06.920
that's how the mystery functions that's why Jesus knows all that stuff about death it's why he's walking around

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:14.079
raising people from the dead didn't you wonder didn't you wonder why is this man walking around into tombs and there

00:42:14.079 --> 00:42:20.319
little kids all over these tombs and he's raising them from the dead didn't that disturb

00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:27.119
you you know we're going to have to account for this the devil wanted me to let everybody know nobody is getting off

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:32.480
the hook right Humanity

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:38.440
worships a disgusting pedophile named

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:44.720
Jesus dude was arrested in a public park with a naked boy you don't think that

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.800
you're going to go across that event horizon and when when you get to that

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:58.240
actuality that we are the reflection of you don't think you're going to be held responsible for support in that you

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:05.680
don't think the cosmos is all interrelated you don't think the Greeks were yelling about judgment over and

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:13.720
over and over again because they understood how nature works yeah we're headed for it we're

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:19.000
headed for it your honor I would give you this appeal I will give you this

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.440
appeal your honor we cannot

our technology is terrible compared to what they could do you know they could give somebody body an erection for a

00:44:57.319 --> 00:45:04.079
week a week when I read that I was like what that's crazy and the source says

00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:11.359
yeah but the person will die eventually you can't keep them that long in that

00:45:11.359 --> 00:45:19.440
state huh must be I bet it's a blood pressure thing I bet eventually your heart just can't take it yeah I bet it

Medicaid dildo we got to get this guy with this Venom stat right where's the

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:39.000
Priestess we need milk right that's what they call it milk it's the stuff that always saves you from the death so when

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.680
somebody asks me are they putting people um are they putting people actually to

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:50.800
death um and then Reviving them is the person actually

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:57.200
Dead We Know It looks like we know it looks like they look like they're dead

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:03.079
and we know they can bring them out of it and we know that if you don't administer the drugs to bring them out

00:46:03.079 --> 00:46:08.480
of it they'll die so I don't know you're putting a person on this kind of plane

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:15.480
of halfway here halfway there and bringing them back Reviving them they're

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:21.280
laying them out in their tombs you didn't know Jesus was a necromancer kids

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:28.280
yes he's a necromancer let's go to the source again everybody everybody in the congregation is like you you keep going

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:35.640
you keep going I just want you to see a drug here I told you I would bring you a cure this is the form of the

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:42.599
frankincense look at the Middle Line This is that form of Frankincense

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:49.640
remember we're around the Angels we're talking about the stuff they're burning right that's giv us the vision well this

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:54.920
is the good stuff this is the good stuff of the fumigation and what does this

00:46:54.920 --> 00:47:00.440
stuff do um you're not going to believe this it's a

00:47:01.319 --> 00:47:07.839
stal it is something that stops

00:47:07.839 --> 00:47:15.359
cancer you know now when they say when they say um cancer they're talking about

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:22.880
all sorts of things that we would break down more now and say well this is this and this is that but they use this for

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:31.160
when they're talking about the stuff that you know looks like a crab on your skin so the skin cancers this is what

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:36.520
they're talking about so we know this is some kind of what you and I know is

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:44.520
cancer and this thing is able to stop and regress the cancer but it's not just

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:50.640
the myrrh it's a combo it's a combo and the way they're

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:56.240
doing it is they're misting people with it misting you're breathing it in

00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:02.400
and it's making contact with your skin so it's all practice and this is

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:07.640
sophisticated from Antiquity people I'm telling you I'm telling you this

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:13.559
sophistication level here is phenomenal um let's go to the next

00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:20.280
