00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.580
case against Jesus who was arrested in a public park at 4am with a naked boy

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.739
fastest ever as we're building our case trying to explain what his motive and

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:31.020
his motivations were we've got to really have what I call corroborating

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.780
evidence on a trans-dimensional plane this is

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.000
corroborating evidence what is going on in the cult today if you can I could get

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.900
into a space time ship and go back and see it we'd be in the best circumstances and it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.560

been asking me many choices I said you know people are

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:41.039
getting drugs in their eyes in Antiquity letting your sources he doesn't have any

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:48.260
sources it's because you know know the sources you classes you have

bottom with a red tack yes we're talking about

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:23.340
drugs and actual history and you need to

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:30.659
realize those myths are based as they themselves argued on people's

00:31:30.659 --> 00:31:37.279
yeah actual people right love it

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:43.620
let's go back to these drug users one more Greek text I know people are saying take your time but I don't want to take

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:49.620
too much time okay this is the dirty one here we got to this point 33 minutes

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:56.279
before it got dirty now people want to know take it down people want to know what's this Magus

00:31:56.279 --> 00:32:03.120
what is this person who knows the gifts of Hermes what is he doing

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:12.240
what is he doing okay now I'm gonna have to give this to you

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.340
in a way that is very very clinical

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:22.220
and does not stimulate us

00:32:23.039 --> 00:32:28.700
let me tell you what is going on

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:41.100
as investigators you're looking at a crime scene with boys

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:47.700
and girls and Pirates

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:53.720
you're looking at a scene where people are using drugs

00:32:53.720 --> 00:33:01.580
to bridge the gap between the two worlds that are fixed upon each other

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:09.440
now you're dealing with the world of initiation foreign

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:18.240
boys are brought to adulthood

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:24.059
through a drug influenced interaction

00:33:24.059 --> 00:33:28.320
with an adult female

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:34.860
who is not only drugging aforementioned boy

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:42.799
so that he may see Aphrodite but she is as a willing vassal

00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:51.620
accepting that diamond to bring him to the place vision

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:59.519
that is an initiation that is an initiation

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:05.940
okay let's look at some drugs see what kind of stuff their reason

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:12.480
bring back that same text and want to finish that off yeah um so or we gotta we have any star of it

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:18.599
the a theory who are a theory um I actually put this one up here and

00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:24.240
so I kind of want to show it to you but you know it is some it equals parthenos

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:31.320
uh it is the Virgin on the masculine side it's as virgin as they get for

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:39.839
masculine right now when I say virgin I do not mean um a hymenly intact human being

00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:45.080
right you can have a um uh

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.638
discussion of what a virgin is on a modern level or you can ask about

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:55.858
Antiquity and you know different times is going to change you wanna but if you

00:34:55.859 --> 00:35:01.740
follow the Greek that virgin is the one

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:06.900
who has not yet carved

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:13.320
is how they put it and from that I'm sorry people if you don't if you don't like being compared

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:19.619
to livestock you know that's too bad because that's what they're doing

00:35:19.619 --> 00:35:25.020
um they're talking about the one of the species that has not yet

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:30.240
produced a child has not yet produced child that's the

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:37.440
virgin that's the Virgin and it turns out it's an age group it's an age group

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:44.220
yeah it's an age group so let's go see back to the text let's

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:51.180
see what kind of stuff is going on why am I how do we get Divergence this is crazy tonight if you think this is crazy

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:58.440
write something because okay I'm look I'm doing the best I can to bring this to you and most educated way possible

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:06.119
are you ready oh my goodness but it makes it so hard what are these things the a theory those

00:36:06.119 --> 00:36:13.560
are those virgin boys and what are they there what does that mean oh that's tender

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:19.260
flesh baby the tender flashed boys

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:26.099
what are they their information and you can see the word hormone on that

00:36:26.099 --> 00:36:34.619
second line yeah see the horme these are hormone driven these people who are in the mode

00:36:34.619 --> 00:36:41.940
you'll see the girls in a second it's a little bit scary what they're giving them they're giving them aphrodisiacs

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:50.760
why they say it all of this is to lead you to Aphrodite you will be seeing her

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:57.180
isn't that fantastic okay all right I think I get it you hear the idolatry now

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:04.560
that now you'll know why the great Victorian stuffed shirts said

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:10.560
um hey uh this word is either idolatry or it's fornication

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:17.579
yeah we can't tell the difference really right oh my

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:24.060
God I heard some Protestant in in England somewhere I heard their face

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:29.339
just crack at that just shatter I love that what are we doing here pull that

00:37:29.339 --> 00:37:35.040
dirty thing up again that last one pull that thing up let's just bring it to them this is enough this is enough look

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:44.220
I've taken your time let me just present the evidence what is it what happens those those boys they charge up to this

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:51.000
Christ what do they do they they bring the surrounding in the palm

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.400
they do wait what they they like to wrap

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:02.339
something up in their Palm with him in their Humanity sea oh no

00:38:02.339 --> 00:38:08.640
that's not good that's not good that means sexual desires oh my God humorous

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:14.040
is you know it makes sense that emeros is here because humorous accompanies

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:20.579
Aphrodite everywhere she goes and you say pull that down I want to give them a quick Aphrodite effect for those of you

00:38:20.579 --> 00:38:26.400
who are trying to portray Aphrodite please please please she is not the most

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:32.339
beautiful goddess everybody knows who obeys and is

00:38:32.339 --> 00:38:37.920
persuaded by the gods knows that Hera is the most beautiful

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:45.060
yes yes of course of course well why is Aphrodite in the whole

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:50.339
sexual desire thing what not because everywhere she goes

00:38:50.339 --> 00:38:55.500
desire goes with her she's that one

00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:01.619
that takes that desire okay I'm beginning to see and this is

00:39:01.619 --> 00:39:06.780
important because remember we're going to these gods for all my Muslim brother

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:13.140
and brothers and sisters out there um remember that your ancestors if we

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:20.460
were to appeal to your ancestors we would appeal to a civilization that followed

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:26.280
Aphrodite Aphrodite and there's a little piece

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:31.859
there's a little piece of that a Remnant that is held on a Remnant inside the

00:39:31.859 --> 00:39:41.940
heart of every beating human says I feel it I feel that aphrodite I feel her

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:47.099
yeah isn't that gorgeous I love it go to the next what else is happening with

00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:54.359
this dude because this is what's going on with Jesus apparently the boys you know like to be around Heracles

00:39:54.359 --> 00:40:00.180
as he tells us the boys like to be around here please all right he's got a naked kid with him

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:06.480
right do you have a problem that Heracles has a naked kid with him because if you don't if you do you're

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:13.800
gonna have to turn away from every classical statue that you see because hylas is always there he even stops his

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:18.839
Great Expedition on the Argo which is supposed to be one of if not

00:40:18.839 --> 00:40:24.300
the first ship and what does he do in the region at

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:29.400
least what does he do Heracles instead of staying on this
